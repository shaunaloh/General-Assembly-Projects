VR can be such a great tool for teaching about history. Letting students see what it was like to be in the trenches of Verdun, or like this project, see the horrors of the Holocaust right in front of you.

"Don't waste your money. This doesn't fix it, and plenty have tried. This is Oculus' fault and there is no fix whatsoever. I have tried literally everything. Support is zero help. It will randomly work sometimes and randomly not work the other half of the time. Absolutely no rhyme or reason. This carries true on BOTH computers I use it on.",oculus
You mean delete the Oculus app from my PC and redownload?,oculus
"I'm in the same boat. Between work, family and caregiver obligations I really only have a few hours on the weekends (and sometimes not even that) to get my VR fix. I own Skyrim and Borderlands 2 for my PSVR and while those games are great they've also helped me to see that I really just don't have the free time to get the most out of them. A sub-10 hour game is just about right for me these days. It's something I'm able to finish in 3 or 4 sessions and then be able to sample something else and I'm grateful there are quality games that fall into that time commitment.",oculus
"I think it will hit $299 by the end of 2020 sometime.  I think it should be $299 because it is basically a Quest but with less parts, no battery or processor or memory,  which should cost way less to produce.  Also the materials in the Rift S seem cheaper than the Quest and it uses 1 LCD instead of 2 OLED screens.  If they would have released it at $299, I think it would sell like hot cakes.  Even $300 is a lot to some people, and this would have allowed more people to jump in to VR.",oculus

"The Index HMD is top notch, wider FOV, amazing sound, clear lenses, great comfort.  The Index controllers are much better than the Vive Wands, and it is nice to have 5 finger presence and grip sensors, but I don’t think they are a huge improvement over the oculus touch.  In some ways, oculus touch is easier to use, especially for oculus exclusive games.  Index controllers do not have universal support across all games like the Vive wands and the Oculus touch do.",oculus

"Tonight I am going to be playing the upcoming retro style VR FPS game Theta Legion. As most of you know I am a bit old school and came up playing games like the original Doom, Quake and Unreal so when the devs reached out to me to see if I wanted to give their game an early look I jumped at the chance! 

Theta legion was originally created for the Oculus Go but will soon be released for the Rift and possibly will also make its way to the Quest. The game is tentatively set for release on 12/5 in the Oculus store so if you like what you see here tonight be sure to look for it then! \[\]-)

Theta Legion as described by the developers:

Theta Legion is a new, exciting, and immersive fast-paced VR first person shooter for the Oculus Rift.

Inspired by classics such as Doom and Quake, Theta Legion has a unique style including a blend of pixel-art textures, 3D environments and 2D sprites.

You play as a member of the Space Foreign Legion sent to investigate planets and space stations and clear all the threats you may encounter. The game is divided into several missions, taking place in various environments and you are pitted against many different enemies.",oculus

"""I Expect You to Die"" has my top vote.  

Call of the Starseed (The Gallery Ep1) is great and an adventure puzzle type game but might not be considered casual.  Obduction is another puzzle adventure but again probably not casual.

"I get where you're coming from. In honor of Witcher TV show on Netflix in a few weeks, I'm replaying Witcher games, and Witcher 3 is BRUTALLY long. Amazing, wonderfully written, but long. So very, very long. However, on the flipside, you have games like Fisherman's Tale, that is over in 60-90 mins. 

My problem with VR games is that most are WAY less than 10 hrs. They're in 4-6 hr range. As such, they need to be priced accordingly. It's not cool when VR game devs are exploiting the enthusiasts who are so starved for any new content that they will purchase any 4 hr piece of crap for $30. In the meantime, you have absolute gems on flatscreen market priced well below $20, and lasting 2-3x as long. Mark of the Ninja, for example, was roughly $15 at launch, iirc, and took 8-10 hrs. That's much more reasonable.

So, do I mind short games? Not at all. Though, in all honesty, if I have to learn a new and complex ruleset, or any intricacies, in a game that lasts 5 hrs, I won't bother, it's not worth the time to learn it for such a short experience. Luckily, in VR, this is a lot less of an issue because controls are usually very intuitive, with the exception of abominations like Fallout 4 VR. But they have to be priced lower given what they're offering. If it's going to be amateur hour, keep it under $15-20. But when something like Witcher or Divinity or a slew of other games give you 40-120 hrs of MAJESTIC content for $60, window-licking VR game that lasts 6 hrs for $40 (Stormland, Lone Echo, etc) is a bit much.",oculus

"I played it this month on Viveport. It's cute, reminds me of the movie Avatar a lot. But yes, there's tons of harvesting, which is slow because you can only shoot one tree at a time, and wait for it to explode, and then you have to switch weapons to shoot rocks, which take even longer to explode. There's no map, no markers, no way to know which plants drop what, which makes crafting annoying since you'll be backtracking a lot. Difficulty felt fine, though I immediately crafted two automatic pistols and used them akimbo. Combat is very primitive - backtrack and shoot, or charge and shoot, depending on enemy type.

Full disclosure - I never finished it, got bored. Harvesting and crafting were just too slow and annoying. But on sale for $5, it's not the worst thing in VR out there. The setpieces are often absolutely breathtaking.",oculus

"Weird, FoV should be comparable. You did find the button on the bottom-right of your headset (opposite to the mic hole), it lets you slide the mask farther or closer to your face. A neat trick is to slide it as close as possible BEFORE putting the headset on, and go in nose-first. This way my eyelashes brush the lenses, and field of view is pretty good. But it hurts my face, so I tend to set it back one click.",oculus

"There's fairly cheap ($15-25) Panasonic clip-ons, and the Koss KSC75. You can even 3D print adapters for the Koss, and attach them to the headset.

Having said this - depending on the  game you play this isn't advisable. I did roughly 2 hrs in one standing session in Asgard's Wrath last weekend, on highest difficulty, and the Koss ear clips wore my ears RAW. Like...painful, almost to the point of bleeding. Because in combat I move a lot, and the earclips slide around from violent motion. This doesn't happen when gaming on flatscreen, because my head barely moves at all, but in active VR it fucked up my ears.

So I wouldn't exactly recommend on-ear clips if you're doing something like BoxVR or Beatsaber. Unless you have big leathery ears or something. Mine are delicate, and I regretted that marathon session for half a week before they healed. And in Canadian weather (below freezing) it's not a good feeling.

(Hellblade, X-plane 11.) The big emphasis on these games is keeping the framerate up. That matters WAY more than what graphics setting you are on. Resolution is more limiting at the current state of VR than the difference between High and Low. With your specs you can go in confident that you are gonna have a really good time.",oculus

"Well, maps are linear, so it's not an open world, so you won't get lost or anything. You have your home/hub, and you venture forth. Later on, you unlock portals to teleport farther away, so you don't have to walk the whole way. The Sci-Fi feel is wonderful, and the whole alien flora and fauna was pretty great. But all the minutiae of base building and management, having to eat and drink now and again (and you get hungry and thirsty when you die, and get sent back to base). There is a quest marker showing loosely where you need to go, though they do disappear from time to time, but there's precious little info otherwise. 

Overall, I found it enjoyable. But I got to the point in the game where I have to craft new weapons and armor, and I blew a lot of resources building turrets like the game asked me to, and I don't have it in me to walk around exploding rocks and trees for an hour to craft it, and finish the game in another hour or two, just isn't worth the time investment.",oculus

A great example is that I am thalassophobic. Deep water and large sea creatures are utterly terrifying to me. When I see a photo of a blue whale silhouette in the deep abyss, it just makes me skin crawl.

"I don't agree. As I said, even the original Rift CV1 with seated-only and gamepad games was not really using 6dof the way modern VR games do. Heck, it did not even jave a gyro controller like Go.

I might just try to use my Bluetooth hooked earphones. Hopefully the latency isn't terrible,oculus
"The on-board speakers on Rift S are also not THAT bad. Not great, but not completely unworkable either. Sometimes I even prefer them, when I'm waiting for delivery and need to be aware.",oculus
"He didn't say ""VR sucks"", he said ""Half Life VR sucks"" because he was afraid it was going to be just another tech demo.",oculus
i use some wired bose soundsports that dont have ear hooks but rather some other hook thing that sits in your ear and i like them a lot,oculus
"CV1 was 6DOF head movements though, even without Touch that made it a much more comfortable experience, but all that was 3 or 4 years ago.

3DOF in 2019 needs to die for the good of VR.",oculus

"Not really, in my opinion. It's a pair of cotton socks you put on your existing face interface. And being just regular fabric it soaks up sweat and oils, and transfers them onto the original foam underneath. I got better mileage out of a similar thing but made of silicone, at least that one is impermeable.",oculus
Wow what a letdown,oculus
Does anyone else just figure it out by adjusting the IPD until it becomes clear?,oculus
Ok thanks! I bought it anyway. For $6 it can’t be a bad decision!,oculus
"They did say they're working on the usual leather interface, like the ones they already released for Quest and even Index. I don't know what's taking so long.",oculus
I’ll check some of these out for sure,oculus
Do you know of a good way to record Oculus Home. I would love to have a video of the issue. Occulus home is the only app that doesn't mirror to my monitor.,oculus
Woah ok I can see the difference is substantial compared to the rift s.,oculus
"Yeah, I clocked a good number of hours in that one, really enjoyed the vibe. Very Avatar-ish.",oculus
It really is a shame. Game has great models and mechanics,oculus
"He’s asking about where you bought it originally, to try to guess whether it’s running natively or via SteamVR. 

Anyways, perhaps rerun the SteamVR setup?",oculus

"**The Allegory of Love (Veronese)**

The Allegory of Love is a series of four paintings by Paolo Veronese, produced around 1570 as ceiling paintings. Some experts have established that they were commissioned by Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor (1552–1612) for Prague Castle. They are now part of the collection of the National Gallery in London.

"Hello, I see by you post that you are having some issues setting up your third sensor for your Rift. I would like to provide a great article that we have that may assist you in this [click here](https://www.oculus.com/blog/oculus-roomscale-tips-for-setting-up-a-killer-vr-room/). If you have any other questions please reach out to us and create a support ticket at [https://support.oculus.com/](https://support.oculus.com/)",oculus
"Are you goin to be able to go into the gas chambers and have a nazi drop a canister in the showers? Like is this an “experience the horrors of what the Jewish people endured” or just a walkthrough as if it is now, a historical site? I would never want to be in the position of these brave people but I would love to experience this through vr.  I get so emotional watching documentaries and place myself in their shoes. The fear I feel for those poor souls. I know this is probably seen as sick or sadistic wanting something like this but I think being able to see through the eyes of someone in their shoes would be so powerful.",oculus
"Sorry for the Question, but why not just use 2 sensors only? Does 2 sensors not cover the whole room?",oculus
I ended up getting Pavlov and played straight 2 hours. Thanks for the recommendations I'm really enjoying it!,oculus
"I would put the money toward a different game.

I agree with OP that the hand controls are great. And... That's about the only great thing.",oculus
"Yes, they’re awesome! It’s too bad they simplified the haptics to save money when they made the newer version.",oculus
"this is the best VR game I've ever played.  Unfortunately, you can finish it in 8-12 hours. One replay for fun and to admire the visuals and mechanics, and then you're about done :(

But I'll be buying Lone echo 2 the day it comes out, you better believe it.  This game is what makes the Rift worth it.",oculus
There are none. You have to use Kinect or the Vive trackers.,oculus
"Rift S should be around 110 no?

Try removing the facial interface if you don't wear glasses",oculus
"Vr devs are not taking advantage of enthusiasts.  Our market is just smaller so the cost per person has to be higher to give the devs decent compensation.  And my guess is 9 out of 10 times, it's still not enough and most devs lose their shirts with vr.",oculus
Because I just want full coverage without fail and I already own a third sensor. Unless you mean 1 sensor In front and 1 behind? I didn’t think the oculus set up would let you do that,oculus
"Yes there’s an app in the Oculus folder for that. Called Home Mirror or smth, I don’t remember.",oculus
I wonder whether it’s related to the sleep settings on the USB ports.,oculus
"I'm playing asgards wrath right now and while I love the game, the ton of hours just drags on for me.  I want it to be done.

10 to 20 hours is the best amount of time to me.  More than that and no matter how great the game is, my attention drops.

I don't mind 5 hour games.  1 hour gets to be a little too little.",oculus
"Yes it does. My old Rift came with 2 controllers and only 2 sensors. I just assumed that's how it works. Didn't realize you can also add more, unlike the HTC-VIVE that didn't allow more than 2.",oculus
"USB controllers can only handle 2 sensors. As you are on a laptop you are probably maxxing out the controller.

Quest FTW!",oculus
Do you have to change a setting then? I swear during set up it always says they can’t be more than 6 feet apart,oculus
Is this what it means? If so then fml but wouldn’t it not let me even get to the sensor placement part of the set up if that was true ?,oculus
Even after 5 years they are still struggling to get it stable in Windows. Adding another platform to support isn't going to help matters.,oculus
Or you could just use an appropriate OS.,oculus
"The Black Friday sale is over, but I will give you my recommendations anyway. Keep in mind that streaming to a phone is a thing, so they can sit together and enjoy together watching their brothers. This is good, because for the 6 and 10 year old, their IPD is smaller and the Go may cause eye strain. In any event, all 3 should use it sparingly amd should take breaks to check how their eyes feel.

Probably the best games for them to enjoy together will be asymetrical coop games. Two of those are Covert and Keep talking and nobody explodes.

Angry Birds VR will be accessible and enjoyed by all 3, which is good.

Bat Batty Bats is also accessible to all 3, but is best played after Elevator to the moon, whichaybe only the 16 year old will understand.

Birtual Virtual Reality is also accessible, butaybe the youngest one might not het the humor and the point.

Blazerush is like toy cars so will be liked by the 3 of them. The controls are a bit hard, though, so the 6 year ild might struggle.

Dead amd Buried is simple enough and free, but it has (cartoonish) zombies, so maybe not for the youngest.

Eqqo is also accessible and a great story.

Fail Factory has a free demo and is simple and good for small kids.

Kev's compulsion and Mr Cat's adventure are small logical kid games.

Ocean Wonder is awesome for kids (you swim in the water and clean the ocean).

Pet Lab has free demo amd is great for kids (virtual pets &amp; kids, well, obviously a good match)

Slightly Heroes is a fun cartoonish shooter, maybe one of the few suitable for kids. However, it has artificial locomotion, so they will have to ease in.

Bathroom Shooting Games is free ans is also one of the few shooting games suotable to all kids.

Apollo 11 VR is educagional and boys love space usually. Other slave exploration games are Mission ISS and Astronaut VR, Spacewalk VR.

Other educational ones are: Jurassic World, Nuclear, Space Time, the Body VR.

I will write more later.",oculus
Just tried it with only my 2 sensors and it worked fudge,oculus
"buildapc is kind of...odd with some of their recommendations. Unless you're planning on having an insane number of games installed at once, you're better off getting rid of the actual hard drive and putting the money towards a big of an SSD (preferably NVME) as you can get for the same total cost. Installing games to a HDD will give you much, much slower load times.

If you really need the storage for something (like video editing), then obviously get it. I just know that buildapc loves to recommend tiny SSDs for the OS and then tell people to put their games on a slow HDD which makes for a much worse experience when it's usually not necessary.",oculus
Okay thanks,oculus
"Yes actually. I rememberd the first time I set it up it drove me crazy. I ended up putting the sensors in the most inconvenient position (on the ground no less) and very close to each other. That's when I discovered that when you get it running the first time and have access to the oculus home, you can just move the sensors anywhere you want than just go to settings and do a recenter. It was the last time I had to go through that.",oculus
Use Oculus Tray Tool to disable ASW.,oculus
$25 is actually where this should be priced years after release... ill wait for a deeper sale.,oculus
It’s not 85 it’s 110 same as psvr,oculus
Odd I’ll try that in the future lol just wasted some command strips on my third ceiling sensor just to have a different redditor tell me it won’t work cuz they’re plugged into laptop/usb hub ports lmao,oculus
It’s working again! All I did was reinstall the app (which had no effect) and then unplugged my cables in a certain order.,oculus
Is this an oculus store exclusive? I looked on steam and didn't see it and prefer to have all my games on one launcher.,oculus
It is a shame they went backwards with durability with the latest incarnation.,oculus
"You can usually ignore what the software says to do to your sensors. You can also put them way far apart... I have a 15’ long room and had no trouble with the diagonal sensors seeing everything. Just put two on the front corners of your room, up high and looking down and out toward the center of the run, and one behind you diagonal to another, also up high and looking down and out toward the center of the room.

If you’re doing this on a laptop, I’d suggest getting a vive link box for the HMD, and a powered USB port for two of the three sensors, with the third sensor plugged into USB 2.0 if it has it.",oculus
*depth adjustment button* and halo adjustment,oculus

Thank you for contacting Oculus Support. I would be happy to assist you with answering your questions regarding purchasing games while in a bundle.

If you already own the game, it does discount the bundle by the percentage amount of the game you already have. If the bundle is further discounted due to a sale the discount will apply as the bundle as a whole.

**We have no information regarding if the discount is varied per a game or equally applied to all games and typically is up to the developer of the applications.**

Please let me know if we have answered all your questions.

Kindest regards,

Sadly rift s requires lighting to track the room and very few have IR lights to light up the darkness for the headset. Good idea if you have them though,oculus
"&gt; Valve wouldn't like his policy of ""give me money and I'll send you a key when I can.""

Me neither ...",oculus
It’s weird that they cost more than og rift controllers,oculus
"Just try fudging around with the eye relief button to bring the display closer.

Also, be on the lookout for VRCover RIft S facial interface replacement.  We're all hoping it will include a modified gasket that allows us to bring the display closer to our face (thus increasing fov).",oculus
"Having same issue, fatal error with dash and critical error in the background with update.   
Before it was just the critical error so I decided to update and restart PC - and now I have the fatal error and can't use it at all.   
I have never at any point been without internet, and I have 250mb/s and have downloaded multiple GBs in the last 24 hours before restarting and updating Rift.  


I have no idea what to do, this shit makes no sense - every where I read makes it seem like its only without internet, but my internet is completely fine and never had an issue on my Rift",oculus
They were priced lower but cost more to make.,oculus
"If you've taken off the surrounding facial interface, make sure it's fully pushed in. I had light leakage after taking it off. There should be 6 spots to push: two next to the nose guard, one on each side of the facial interface and then, where the facial interface is flat horizontally at the top, two there (one on each corner). If you can't get them, look up a video and it will show you.",oculus
"While I agree, I dont.  The game has to be made a certain way to make me want it.  For example games like Contractors I would prefer its not there, pavlov the same.  But immersive single player, I like it.",oculus
Anything with Boneworks physics would be cool. I hope that level of detail in physics becomes the new norm.,oculus

At least wait to try it before you crown it.,oculus
"That's tough. Asgard's Wrath is the most fun and impressive VR game I've played to date. It's truly a tier above everything. I have not played Lone Echo yet and have heard similar testimonials. I don't think you can go wrong with either, but I highly recommend getting Asgard's Wrath someday.",oculus
"&gt;Does 2 sensors not cover the whole room?

3 sensors allowed for a larger room scale and better tracking coverage",oculus
"Sorry you are going to have to be more creative than that.  Calling a game a ""tech demo"" is not the go to name for games you did not like.  Tech demo specifically is showcasing a new form of gameplay or elements but lacking a story around it.  This game is all story, emotion, and its even done between a human and robot.  You are totally fine to not like the game but don't just call it a ""tech demo"" cause others have been referring to some VR games as such.",oculus

Yes and that is a bad excuse considering you can launch Steam games from Oculus and Oculus games from Steam.,oculus

This is such a wild idea that I love it and want you to post back with how it goes.,oculus
Its the damn face cover.  Remove it temporarily and see how much fov you gain. There has to be a modded one we can get that will help.,oculus
I got a big Lasko fan right in front of me with my ceiling fan going every time I'm in VR. Works wonders,oculus

Find somewhere you can try a Quest. Its fov seem on par with what i remember from psvr and vive. Its definetly bigger than cv1 for me. You have to get the fit right though.,oculus
"thanks, those games look great!",oculus
Think about it.. The PC side is as far as they can take it before they get mainstream money.  Everything that is being worked on with  Quest and link will actually be next version PC.. and mobile.  So all this is just perfecting what is going to be their next gen all in one version.,oculus
"It is, but with Revive you really only need the Oculus app to buy/install the game and that's it. From then on you just launch it directly from the Revive hub in SteamVR.",oculus
i play without the facemask due to high IPD. i wish so bad that there was a shallow version of the mask attachment,oculus
"Not really doing the system justice by saying if you play games ""requiring no turning"" since you can easily turn with that setup.  The wire does not even prevent you from actually turning all the way around, it just slows you down if you want to spin 360.  Yes wireless feels better but at what cost right now?  Too much id say.",oculus
Vr cover has one though I don’t know how much it helps.,oculus
"It is not the same as the Rift S, I really wish people would stop saying this.  Its close and it gives you a taste but it is not the same.  You also have 1 less camera which does make a difference in non casual games.  I know this because I own both and my kids everyday try to get the Rift S from me when I offer them the Quest.  It's more comfortable, games run better/look better, the sound is better quality at this moment as well.",oculus
"I was tempted to change the title, but its a crosspost from another subreddit.",oculus
When that happens to me I unplug it and plug it back in to a different USB 3 port and then unplug and reinsert the Display port cable.  Then I check and it should connect.  If you close Oculus and open again it should be gone.,oculus

Yes. Stupid app :),oculus
"3 sensors, thumb, Index, and the middle finger +the rest of the finger. 

It does detect the touching and pressing. Thumb also detects touching the joystick or the 2 other buttons.",oculus
"Yes, this was the first huge title with AAA assets that Oculus fully funded and was years in the making before it was released.",oculus
Touch does simple finger tracking for the first 3 fingers. Both Touch and Knuckles use capacitive sensors for the tracking. https://youtu.be/pppkQ4jIrMU,oculus

Uhhh. Tried doing anything behind you with PSVR? It don’t work.",oculus
The most immersed I've ever felt in VR. I tried to push off walls after playing it.,oculus
"Yeah - its all about cost and they learned that with the Rift launch. The Quest is being sold far less than anyone could sell a similar headset for - I would guess it Quest would be $800-900 if it were HTC, Valve or another company manufacturing it that couldn't subsidize the cost as much. That said, they still had to do what they could to keep production costs lower than the original Rift and the design of the Quest Touch definitely indicates a much easier tooling/assembly process at the expense of durability. They are still REALLY touch, but hit just in the wrong spot where the seams are and they can pop out.",oculus
Go to your nVIDIA settings and add a profile for the game and make you select your dedicated GPU as your preferred video card.,oculus
"Most people would disagree. Lone Echo is still one of the best made for VR titles out there. Because it was in production years before Touch released the beginning of the game starts slow figuring they would need train people to get used to the controls/zero G etc. Some of the tasks do get redundant - but the story picks up after that and the game has AAA assets with some amazing 'this is amazing looking' moments. Lone Echo 2 should be amazing with more action to go along with the narrative, but the majority of people that have played Lone Echo will agree it shouldn't be missed.",oculus
"&gt; $299.99, which is where I think it should have been priced since the get go.

I just don't get that. It has been selling really well with a MSR of $400, so people thingk it is worth that much. Why should it hsve been released at $300?",oculus
Drink less water,oculus

"I think you can agree that the 3dof in sitting controller games is not as useful in standing or roomscale Touch games.

I don't buy the argument that if something was VR a couple of years ago, it is no longer VR now.

By the same logic you can argue that Super Mario Brothers is no longer a game after Super Mario 64.",oculus
"From the images of broken controllers in the quest sub, they aren't anywhere close to the toughness of the OG Touch, those things were very hard to break.",oculus
Easy yes. It's still one of my favorite VR games and a unique experience. It and Chronos are both excellent examples of how 3rd person view can still be enhanced with VR.,oculus
"The Oculus Touch (I only know the first gen from CV1) are awesome and ""just perfect"". There are little apps/games (any???) where I would need to justify knuckles and 5 fingers. The knuckles IMO are hopelessly overengineered and also way too big.",oculus
We have gone from phones strapped to faces to full on VR today in less than a decade. The goalposts have moved.,oculus
"Yep, same here. 30 minutes - 1 hour a day is more than enough for me. More? Maybe once in the future when I'll be retired :)",oculus
Okay thanks :),oculus
They are awesome but that O ring on the top really makes me paranoid. It's so thin and flimsy looking I'm afraid one I'll bump them by accident one too many times and crack. I think the index controllers are probably the best though because of how you can move your individual fingers in VR with them.,oculus
Physically maybe but mine broke (joystick and buttons) after few months,oculus
"I'm not saying the quest isn't a good unit, but I don't think i could take the visual downgrade of the games to play without wires.

When using the link cable, i feel i may as well just got the rift.

And big improvements will come to the rift in the end",oculus
"Not very comparable, as Hellblade is more a cinematic experience than any of those games.  Also, those are all first person games, whereas Hellblade is third person.

But yeah, it's definitely worth it, especially on sale.",oculus
"Agree. I only know second gen (Quest/S) Touch, but I love how small and light they are. They just disappear in your hands. I used Vive, WMR and Cosmos controllers, and they feel incredibly clunky in comparison. Not to mention it felt like they took half of my work room table :)",oculus
"I always set up guardian and the room with only the two front sensors plugged in. After that's done and it's ""ready to go"", I plug in the third and everything just works perfectly. 

There will be an annoying prompt asking me if I want to set up roomscale but just by plugging the third in, roommscale works automatically, and the third sensor tracks. Hope that helps!",oculus
"Nice, any information regarding a release date or a potential beta ?
Thanks.",oculus
3D printed mounts from thingiverse that I have screwed into the wall next to my desktop. The headset and controllers fit in them perfectly when not in use,oculus
It's the best so far in my opinion. Had a great time with it.,oculus
That does help I’m going to do that tomorrow for sure!,oculus
"Just give it a bit of time, to get used to it. It's like this with every new hmd you get. It feels different and for the first few days you usually notice ""downgrades"" way more than upgrades.",oculus
i have a rift s and an index and i also prefer touch. damn knuckles are just to unwieldy and big,oculus
Why does he prefer the rift s?,oculus
Make sure to disable windows defender or vpn and firewalls. It happened to me as well. I disabled everything and deleted oculus and restarted my pc and re downloaded and it viola.....it worked.,oculus
Does Asgard have teleportation movement?,oculus
"This was a big issue when Rift S first released, and still suffers some minor stutter here and there, but for the most part it's been corrected for months, now.  SteamVR tracking is definitely better, but then you'll have issues with a lot of SDE, which can affect how easy it is to spot targets in shooters.  Ideally, a Valve Index would be the best option, and if you know that you'll be able to make progressive upgrades over the next 2 years, you can start with a Vive and buy the Index HMD and controllers.  However, if you're like me and know that you'll be pushing it between game and PC part purchases, Rift S will likely be a better option.",oculus
"One thing to point out is they'll give you two numbers, one for each eye measured from the bridge of the nose, which might not be the same for some people. Mine was like 31.5 and 31 mm.",oculus
"I haven't watchednit yet but my opinion:

- while the extra FOV is nice you can archive nearly the same FOV on the Rift S by bringing the lenses as close as possible to your eyes

- the Index really has problems when anything bright is shown at all. It looks like you have fog over your vision. It's really distracting. The Rift S has close to none glare

- the praised Index controller feel really akward. While fingertracking is nice it's just a gimmick. And it even fails here and there.

Not bashing the Index tho. The clarity, comfort and audio are nice. But for 700$ more ? Not really.",oculus
"Quick points of what he mentioned he liked better on Rift S: Controllers, inside out tracking, option to use own headphones easier, ease of setup, $600 cheaper",oculus
Yes,oculus
"Of course, how didn't I think of that. How much should I limit it to? Like a glass every 6 hrs? Or less?",oculus
"Wmr is gonna be slightly better than riftcat, so not worth the money. If you don't have much money look for a second hand Rift S, don't look for CV1 cuz it has terrible God Ray's.",oculus
What do you wear by chance?,oculus
"Summit likes the touch better then the index.

i think his hands too big for index",oculus
"Context was mentioned. I'm comparing to a cv1. And I didn't say the s is bad. Just sharing my opinion on what I've experienced so far. 

I'd hope the S is better when comparing it to oculus link side by side since S is built for pcvr.

From what I've played so far, I'm happy with my quest and pretty impressed with the wireless along with the link tech. It's all a matter of preference and what's important to you.",oculus

"I heard the Mantis ones are pretty good,

But to be honest I just use regular earbuds like you would for your phone, have them tied so they don't annoy me and the sound is superb",oculus
"Cant relate since im one digit below IPD range, but best thing to do is go to highest settings possible",oculus
What do you mean by tied?,oculus
"SDE is NOT seeing the world ""pixelated"", but it seeing the ""black lines between the pixels"". Rift S has basically no SDE at all. Of course, everything is still pixelated. We aren't even close to real-life definition.",oculus

"Nah the picture is bad, tested with an app to 62-65",oculus

"&gt; The Quest is being sold far less than anyone could sell a similar headset for - I would guess it Quest would be $800-900 if it were HTC, **Valve or another company manufacturing it that couldn't subsidize the cost as much.**

By that logic the Index should be $2000",oculus
"So I have them plugged into the side, and then wrapped up on a loop and then come down the back of the headset, I will try and link a photo",oculus
Well i have an Oculus Rift S with most of my dorm room being empty besides 2 beds (duh) and 1 desk. The rest is open for VR. Im an addict,oculus

While I cannot speak to how much the lenses cost, I seriously doubt this considering it is using an old SoC, 72Hz panels and has terrible sound just like the Rift S (I excuse this for the Quest, as portability is a big factor)",oculus
Fuck yeah!,oculus
"It's not a VR game. It's a ""flat screen"" game that has a ""watch it in VR"" mode. You'll play seated with mouse+keyboard or controller.

It's a great game and very fun, but it's a simple port.",oculus
"I'd personally get a Quest because they have IPD sliders and the Oculus Link cables are super easy to replace for cheap (they're just a $15 USB-C 3.1 cable off Amazon). It's the HMD that's most likely to fit your needs, and also pretty nicely futureproofed by relying on such an easy-to-find cable (noteworthy because they've already ceased production of CV1 cables, meaning original Rifts basically become paperweights if the cable breaks).",oculus
"Arent you showing them the wrong games and apps then? There are so many fantastic made for VR games to play and show people these days.  Why introduce someone to VR with a game that is sub par VR mechanics? This idea there are no apps is so 2015. Ignoring all the games and progress we made the past 4 years is silly.

The one and only thing slowing down VR adoption is the price of quality VR, which is steadily declining. One thing i think more people need to understand is that VR is not for everyone. ""Mass adoption"" does not mean literally everyone will have it. IMO Mass adoption is when quality VR is under every kids christmas tree. 

Right now literally ALL the kids want it who have tried it, but it's just too expensive for the average parent. But not everyone is going to be into VR just like not everyone reads books to watches movies. Even someone who is into Video games is not guaranteed to like VR - it's not just a gaming peripheral it's an entire new medium of entertainment. You seriously diminish the magnitude of what VR is by saying it is ""just a 3d screen"" We're literally inserting ourselves into peoples imaginations. It's insane.",oculus
"67 and have no issues on Go, which has similar optics to Rift S and no IPD adjustment.",oculus
that entire setup is $2000+ just so people can see you move your body and eyes... Totally worth it lol,oculus
"Good work, though the little white table needs to go.",oculus
"Cool, I also have rift s. Its pretty easy to move my pc. I just need the power and a cable to plug in to any nearby tv and then I just take the rift s and plug it in, voila bigger play space!",oculus
"Replace, though it needs comfort mods.",oculus
"OG Rift, unless you have 3 cameras, is much worse than Rift S. And even with 3 cameras you have to play with the shutters closed.

Vive has better tracking and a much worse image clarity.

That being said, I don't have any of those issues on my Rift S and Quest.",oculus
Sadly there’s a fuse box above the white table so removing it wouldn’t help. The play area is roughly 2x1.8 meters.,oculus
"Try removing the cable from both ends and plugging it back in. If you still have issues, please make a ticket at [support.oculus.com](https://support.oculus.com). Thanks",oculus
That works??? Cool.,oculus
"I didn't notice the fuse box. I would definitely get a cover for that or really bad things could happen.

Table still needs to go, you are more likely to hit that that the fuse box.",oculus
"Pavlov peaked at 1.453 concurrent players in the last 24hrs, so it is by far the shooter with the biggest community which means you definitely made a good decision. 

https://vrlfg.net/Players

As others said, Onward is also great while being more hardcore than Pavlov.

But Zero Caliber will also soon receive a PvP mode and it still does good numbers, so it is far from dead as you can see at vrlfg.net. You have to consider that the site only shows the Steam player numbers not the people playing the Oculus store version (just like Onward).

In the middle to long term, I can imagine the new Medal of Honor or some highly polished VR BR game like Population One (sadly no news since months) to take over the multiplayer crown. That‘s without considering the possibility that Valve will release a proper CS VR (which Pavlov is known for) themselves. 

My other hope is that Ubisoft is developing a Rainbow Six VR shooter, but their two upcoming games will probably be Assassins Creed and Splinter Cell although Spies vs Mercs could also be great in VR.

Other than that, Solaris Offworld Combat from First Contact Entertainment should als be interesting, would love to have Firewall on PC VR though.

I also remember Dante mentioning Onward 2, so who knows...",oculus

The paragraph before the bolded section, I interpret as saying if you own 1 game and the bundle has 6 games, you pay 5/6 of the bundle price. However, a quick check shows that math doesn't work out so it's the wrong interpretation and I'm still stumped to figure out how they come up with their numbers.",oculus
"I'm not very versed with NZ hardware pricing but based on NZ listings on Newegg the 2070 Super seems to land right at about your budget, for which I would strongly recommend a decently factory overclocked one making it near comparable to a 2080 in terms of framerates. A 5700 XT is modestly competitive for slightly cheaper if you really don't need the feature set of an Nvidia card.

Cheaper alternatives include a 2060 Super, 5700 and a 2070 for which I would primarily look out for good discounts and deals.",oculus
"Do you own the VR versions? Problem no 1 is that you can't play the regular versions in VR, you have to get the new full priced VR versions of the games. However, I found steam keys for them pretty cheap by just googling.

"Btw, more here:

""HTC Vive has two screens 1080x1200 per eye or 2160x1200 combined . However, the default/100% supersampling is actually 1.4 times that in each direction 1512x1680 per eye or 3024x1680 combined.
The short answer is the lens distorts the image which he have to account for. So we do the opposite distortion to the image we display on the screen which compresses the edges of the image and loses fine detail. So in order to preserve the detail we do a bit of supersampling to account for what is lost because of the lens. I suggest you watch this video for more details.""

"For me it would replace it for seated experiences, like at a desk. The optics are a clear upgrade.

Room scale, is where this changes. The thing has so much front weight, and it has to be worn super tight to keep the optics from shifting when moving fast. The CV1 is just so light on the head. The tracking is also no contest if you have a proper sensor setup (I have 4), you'll have to deal with tracking loss in a number of games that use the space the cameras don't cover. 

Finally the biggest part, the refresh rate. The whole experience felt sloppy and the lower frame rate was definitely perceivable. Going back to the Rift was so much smoother. 

If you get a Quest, keep your CV1. I have both myself (that said, I do have an Index on the way now).",oculus

"The 1080ti is for sure still very competitive, but the slightly better performance claim is not accurate. There are scenarios in which it's slightly ahead but also ones where it's substantially behind.

Is the gtx 1060 good enough?,oculus
I bought it from a company called trademax. I live in Sweden so I don’t know where you can get one. It’s probably cheaper in your country. Everything is expensive in Sweden.,oculus
Thanks!,oculus
"I'd hold on to your CV1 for the time being, unless you replace it with a dedicated PC headset.

World scale is smaller on the Quest (you have to compare directly to see this for yourself), so the immersion is slightly less impressive.

Also the tracking, while good, is not as good as a 3 sensor setup for the Rift, or as the 5 camera array on the Rift S.

Comfort is a big issue. To be honest I could have almost bought a Deluxe Audio Strap for the money I've spent on counter weights battery packs and facial interfaces to make it comfortable.

It is an excellent headset in its own right for untethered experiences (large spaces + Quest = amazing), and games can look better on Oculus Link due to higher resolution and less SDE (though the picture is noticably soft).

I was thinking of ditching my CV1 for the Quest, but mainly due to the comfort and world scale issues I'll probably go for a Rift S instead.",oculus
What would be a good thing to search for?,oculus

"You could have been warned about the FOV on the Rift compared to the PSVR with a little research. The PSVR also has a better comfort level. Besides those two things though, the Rift excels in every other aspect and much better library (besides RE7 never getting a PC debut). The Move controllers horrible tracking capabilities also massively degrade the quality of PSVR Vs Rift. I own both (CV1 though) so this isn't a one-sided opinion.",oculus
"Yes but Oculus uses a similar amount of default oversampling, it would look terrible without it due to the lens distortion correction. For the CV1 the default render target is 2700x1600 combined. So slightly lower than Vive but not significantly.

If it showed up as 1.4 at 100% in your tests you must have had an additional source of supersampling somewhere. For instance in SteamVR there are separate settings for global SS and application SS. Then the game itself can also do its own SS.",oculus
"Depends on what you consider good enough. My recent upgrade has been from an 1060 OC to a 2070 Super OC. A fair few games run absolutely fine on a 1060 if you are not very picky about resolution. Having some leeway for SS and high settings otherwise makes the VR experience exponentially better, but at a very significant tradeoff in price.",oculus
"&gt; You'll play seated with mouse+keyboard or controller.

People always bang on about this. Doesn't hurt the immersion or wonder one little bit.  It's all we had when the DK1,DK2 and even CV1 first came out before Touch was released.  Makes no difference to the fun.. Bloody newbies.  Also, if you can see more to VR  than the purists here, grab a copy of Vorpx.  You'll never be bored or at a loose end of what to experience.",oculus
Yes!,oculus
"Dude, I've never said it wasn't fun. Op asked how it was comparing it to Asgard Wrath and alike which uses full body movement. They uses a completely different set of controls. He needed to know before purchasing a product that might not be what he was expecting.

"Keep it. I'm sorry I sold mine. I've got a Rift S and Quest, but I should have kept the CV1 and just just not get a Quest. The Quest is a fine piece of tech, but with a great PC, there's no point (for me) in owning a Quest as the Rift S is just straight up, a better experience.",oculus
"Im the same way but it extends to flat games as well. For me it's a age thing I think because when I was younger I could play through games no matter the length without finding it boring at all. These days it's rare for me to find a game I like enough to be able to finish it. I think Jedi Fallen Order will be the first in a long time and alot of people are complaining that is too short, for me it's on the long side.",oculus

"This is for the rift s, which has a fixed ipd.",oculus
I just got a rift s too.  Biggest disappointment for me is the comfort.  I'm going to have to jury rig a solution for it.  Dunno if I'll find a solution for this.  My head gets numb after about 20 minutes.  Thinking maybe of putting a thick sock through the center strap.,oculus
They're cheap as fuck on amazon.,oculus
As far as Im concerned its the best VR game developed thus far. It's stunning in its quality. The modeling and animation of Olivia is jaw dropping and interacting with the environment makes VR so worth it.,oculus
"I personally went with the rift S because of the price but I felt like he didn't give it a fair chance and complained ALL stream without actually trying to fix the issue. 

It seemed like he didn't even know anything about the index and didn't know how to adjust the grips on the controller to never actually calibrating the controllers.

Not to mention he only played on one game that is known to not have the best experience with the knuckles to begin with. All while the person he was playing with PokeLawls didn't have any issues at all and felt comfortable with it.

If he was actually level-headed and took some time with it then came to the same conclusion without sounding like a baby I would say is 100% fair.",oculus
"Huge variance between games, the reality is that optimization or rendering pipelines do make a difference with things like heavy pixel shaders and high resolutions crippling low end cards like a 1060. You can for sure run a game like Beat Saber or the SteamVR hub quite comfortably on it, these are light or otherwise optimized and will run decently on most hardware. Now try it with 200-300% SS, or a heaver/less optimized game and the 1060 is suddenly struggling to comfortably push anywhere near 90 frames.",oculus

"They're also durable af, I've bashed my floors, walls, ceiling and various objects that were too close so many times and they still work flawlessly lmao.

"Can’t agree more! I rather pay and play a short-to-medium ~6-8h game than a +40h game. Then I know I will have time to finish and enjoy the game fram start to finish.

I can throw in Talos Principle VR as an example here. For me it ended up being a +35h game that I absolutely loved, but it would have been even better if it was reduced to about 10-12h. In this case the story was so compelling that I grinded my way to the finish. Took me 2 months to complete. I still love the game to bits but at the same hesitant to invest that amount of time in a game again.

And a bit off topic but, one of my all time favorite games for PS3 was the 2h game ”Journey” by That Game Company. Just perfect story and gameplay. Shows that games doesn’t have to be long to be enjoyed and memorable.",oculus

"Yeah this is a big purchase for me so it will probably be a one time purchase until it breaks with maybe some accessories like foam covers and some actual audio. This is one of the reasons I didn't want to get the quest even though you can use it almost anywhere its space is limited meaning I would have had to get the 128g version plus a usb c 3.0 cable if I wanted to use oculus link or I could just get the rift buy a couple games plus the few that i already have (the forest, slime rancher, subnautica) and play",oculus

"Out of curiosity, what makes you sorry for selling your CV1 after having the Rift S? I was originally leaning towards the Rift S but heard it’s not much of an upgrade, which led me to being slightly more interested in the Quest instead. I’ve heard the two biggest upgrades are comfort and visuals, but I already find the CV1 pretty darn comfortable and visuals are nice but not my #1 priority. Then there are some things it’s does worse supposedly, I do like the idea of plug n play though, but that seems to be something the Rift S and Oculus Link would both be good for.",oculus

"I had my CV1 connected to my desktop, and Rift S to my laptop (my laptop is more powerful). That was a good set up, and I kind of liked jumping back and forth between headsets. The Rift S has the sharper screen,  so once you see that, the CV1 appears blurrier, particularly the text which is quite clean on Rift S. I miss the deeper colors of the CV1 (especially the black level in a space game), but I prefer larger sweet spot, much less god rays and almost undetectable SDE of the Rift S. 

Was excited about the Quest, so I figured, I'd have one mobile and one connected headset. I found after a  few days, the Quest was being used much less, and for only short bursts of tetherless gaming. It was just too uncomfortable for me, and when using the link cable, it basically turned it into Rift-S.... with a few sacrifices.  So knowing what I've experienced now, I just should have kept the CV1 as a second headset, and not go for the Quest. Based on the types of games I play (No Man's Sky, Asgard's Wrath and Stormland for example) the Quest makes no sense for me, personally.",oculus

"I'll warn you now since everyone else is saying it's not a problem, This is a problem, Oculus acknowledges it themselves on on of their support pages but no where else. The Rift S doesn't play nice with certain usb port types ie. 3.1 and also with certain usb controller hosts ie eXtensible and Asmedia. You can find at least 1 person posting about loosing tracking a day so it is still a current problem. I love my Rift S and it's a great headset. Just be aware that this is a real problem and it's not going away because that's how they set up the rift software side. 

This problem can be fixed however with either an Orico or Inatek PCIE USB expansion card that uses SATA for power and has the Fresco L1100 chipset which is the only usb chipset oculus themselves guarantees to work on their own support page :/.

90 FPS. Slightly worse resolution than Rift S but you get the OLED lenses, the tracking is more accurate than inside-out, and the controllers will never break.

"From the videos they shared at OC6, it only uses the single pair of cameras looking forward.

The biggest issue is latency. Controllers do high-frequency tracking with internal IMUs that is corrected at a lower frequency by the cameras. Since you hands don't have IMUs, :) they are never going to be tracked as accurately or with the low latency that the controllers are tracked with.

Having the horsepower of a PC would make things easier, but I doubt PCVR developer are going to have much interest in it because of its limitation. It is a better fit for the types of apps that are common in MobileVR.",oculus
"&gt; separate GPU not have all the display ports including HDMI etc come from the GPU?

It's mainly a power saving thing. So if you're connected to a projector and on battery it can just use the internal GPU for that lower performance task. If you're plugged in, or decide to use a GPU task on that screen it will still run it on the GPU, but it then needs to be copied over to the iGPU of the processor, which unfortunately causes too much latency for VR despite being okay for a standard monitor.

You can change that movement where you can move while blocking. I agree that the stamina can be annoying but it's needed for higher difficulty I think.

Here, I recommend this program, just scroll down and you'll see ""Update 10/18"" https://forums.oculusvr.com/community/discussion/47247/oculus-traytool-supersampling-profiles-hmd-disconnect-fixes-hopefully/p1

Download that, run it and in it you can mess with a lot of things, super sampling being one of them.

Supersampling basically renders a higher resolution image and shrinks it down to your screen, so take a 1080p monitor, super sampled to 4k, the image itself is 4k, so it'll look cleaner, sharper and less aliased, but it's obviously not as good as watching it on a 4k monitor, but there is a difference, trust me. 
I pushed my original rift to 1.5 and that's as high as I saw a difference, just jump in a game, look around, get out and set that to 1.5 and jump back in, you'll see what I mean (some people have a hard time seeing it for some reason). Be mindful it doesn't work in game, you HAVE to exit out every time you want to change it, but some games have a ingame one, but if you're doing it through here, I suggest leaving anything ingame to default 100%.

Another thing, if you want this to stay at whatever supersample you set it to (1.5 for example), make sure you launch it everytime you want to play VR, or check mark the box that starts it up on boot, up to you. 

Reply back if you have any questions and hopefully I can answer them, as well as let me know if you notice anything (: cheers",oculus
"Supersampling means setting the GPU to render images at a higher resolution which is then down scaled to the native resolution of the headset.  The effect is similar/related to anti-aliasing which mainly reduces the jagged/pixelated appearance of sharp edges .  It doesn't increase the display resolution of the headset but it can improve the apparent quality.

Greeny is referring to the ""Pixels Per Display Pixel Override"" setting in the Oculus Debug Tool found at:

C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-diagnostics\OculusDebugTool.exe

The setting 1.4 would tell the GPU to render at 140% of the headset resolution.  If they were suggesting that for a 1070 I' sure your 2080 could do better.",oculus

The controllers are also more comfy then the CV1's, they have this sort of soft touch textured grip on the bottom side of the controller and it no longer slides in my hands during intense beat saber sessions. The controllers are a step down in durability though, I hit my ceiling fan while it was on with the old Touch and it just scratched it, I think the same thing would break the ring on the new ones.",oculus

"Dude, trust me you're going to love it, when I did it, I didn't go back, now I own a Rift S and it looks amazing with the default setting, but 1.3 and up makes it even crazier, if you want to push it for science lol go all to the max and see how it looks like, I tried Dirt Rally and Onward at the max with my Rift S, which is like 2.4? It's billions of pixels, but it looked so freaking sharp, I almost cried while driving and shooting LOL it honestly looks mind blowing to me,  LOL.",oculus
"I wish I found the Rift S as comfortable.  Maybe it's a preference thing or a matter of head shape or my longer hair, but I don't like hanging the display in front of me as opposed to strapping it on.  I didn't have a CV1 but I did have a DK1 and I think I even preferred the single elastic band design over the halo.  I'm seriously considering a face cover + Vive Deluxe Audio strap mod.",oculus

"GPU is definitely more important for VR. I'd recommend 1660 Super which offers amazing value right now for $230. 

Fx-8300 is dated, but paired with good GPU could deliver a decent experience. I'd say test it out first, and upgrade only if you feel it's necessary. It's a more involved process though, and you'll have to get new motherboard and RAM.

Interestingly, because of the Oculus garden wall, i'm now purposely buying games on Steam only because I can use both systems on them.

"The cable on the Original Oculus Rift, it's a bit slim, so it can bend easily over time, mine did. There's the little clip on the left side that holds the cable, that's what messes with it, don't take it off, but put something on the right side of it, that basically holds the cable down in a ramp form, so the cable doesn't bend and eventually break from the hard bending.",oculus

I'm really happy that OP got such a good bargain for this system since it's still a great entry.  I disagree with the CV1 being better than the rift s and quest with everything but display. Oculus has the best inside out tracking and even the CV1 needs a 3rd base station to get room scale. It's really a stand up move to keep supporting the CV1 software wise though and the many improvements that have been made to the ecosystem still apply to the CV1,oculus

"Just to add to that, I hold my cable in place with a bit of gaffer tape wrapped round the strap, totally removes all the potential for pull on the connection at the headset end and extends the life of your cable.

I've had the same experience and got berated by someone for saying the S performed better then the CV1 for tracking.

The rift s has just been a 100% better experience tracking wise for me. Also the rift S screen was the first wow moment I've had in VR since I played first contact when I first got my CV1.,oculus

As for the controllers I found the new touch are way more comfy with that soft textured grip on the underside, and compared to my cv1 I no longer find myself readjusting the controllers as they slip during intense beat saber songs like I did with the CV1.

they're not saying the rift S is a 10/10. They're saying if the Rift S is a 10 in the scale so smth like the Index would be a 13/10 or smth. It's just using the Rift S as a perfect score so just they think that the CV1 is worse than Rift S by like 30%,oculus

Yeah Virtual Desktop is better looking so the possibility is there.,oculus
I own a Rift S but I'm honestly considering playing half life alyx on my OG Rift for those extra 10fps.  Valve has always pushed the importance of high refresh rates for immersion and half life alyx seems like it might be a game geared towards creating immersion through fluid interactions with your environment so the OG Rift might have a little bit of an edge there.  Idk,oculus
I would say it's the best VR experience in Oculus lineup... external tracking is the key here. Too bad headset screen is not updated - you either sacrifice the screen or downhrade to inside-out tracking.,oculus

Just get or make a lens cover and never worry about it. Not even worth risking to find out. Even a balled up shirt will do the trick,oculus
Think the point is Oculus should have got it right from the start. They should have had a balanced halo strap for Quest as well and not expect the consumer to figure out how to make Quest comfortable (and pay additional $$ for it).,oculus
hehehe,oculus
"Well worth it, enjoy!",oculus
Hi there! No worries if you don’t respond but I just bought one from amazon myself! Could you tell me what stuff I need to install already to be ready for this when it arrives? I just returned a WMR headset so I kinda impulse bought this but I feel good about it! TIA!,oculus
For me even Rift CV1 was a well designed and comfortable headset that I could wear for hours on end. I sold my Rift before getting Quest and straight away felt the difference when I got Quest. It just felt awkward and has never sat right. Something that could have been avoided if Oculus just made a decent strap for it from the start.,oculus

"I’m in the same position, I’m interested in the mobile experience but feel I’ll use it as a PCVR headset most of the time. If it wasn’t for some supposed added latency from Oculus Link my decision would be easy, but since I mostly placed fast paced games like echo arena and onward i feel like I should upgrade to a Rift S instead.",oculus
"I don't think it's anymore comfortable then the rift, if anything its less.
I went back and forth with my CV1 to Rift S and I didn't see a big difference in game clarity, virtual desktop and gaming browsing is insanely nice but the game itself doesn't get much better looking.",oculus
"The resolution in Rift S is higher, you mean they don't actually use it and render below native resolution? 

Even tho S is 80hz instead of 90hz it should still demand a better GPU for the same performance just by going by numbers, assuming they render at native resolution.",oculus
Yeah I get them mixed up a lot because it's basically the same concept.,oculus
"yea and all this to feel like dog leashed to tree  
tell me what games do pcvr have to hook you for long period of time, beatsaber ? quest have it  
it's like saying, ferrari  have better car and stuff buy it  , and yes it do have, but you will not use ferrari in your city , its was noticed multiple times by a facebook, quest is used much more vs rift , do you realy best  you can and use it less, or get something not so good, but use it all the time ?  
this is main problem of rift, is a pc accessory , not a main driver, in quest vr is a main driver",oculus
Is it issue free? Do I need to tweak anything like key mapping to make it work? I'm too old for this kind things just buy from steam way easier.,oculus
"Oculus has assured developers that they do not intend to add new crontrollers that require developers to deal with a fragmented audience. New controllers will not come until next gen.

Note that the announced hand tracking will not cause fragmentation because it does not require users to buy new hardware to use it.",oculus
It’s better imo. I like the screen better on quest and just having one usb cable I can plug in vs a hard wired cable is great for storing it until needed. portability adds a whole heap of free value to it too.,oculus
"Lol, you're right, the post is at 0 already 😁 I'll add it to my set of trophies, together with the post explaining to Index fans why I went with Oculus even though I am a true Valve fanboy and admire how Index pushes the limits. 😜

But I'm surprised with these software issues. Oculus released a sub-$400 headset with reasonably good specs - which is a great achievement in itself - it's actually affordable at its current price. They got the inside-out tracking right, where Vive failed. And yet they couldn't sort out port communication, meaningful error messages and graceful fail.",oculus

"i redid setup and it seems to be ok now, we'll see how long it lasts",oculus
"From what you've described, it sounds like the issue is more likely to be on your PC's end rather than the headset.

In VR, more FOV is always better. Since IPD is rather individual (there are sweet spots, but generally you don't need to have the lenses set to your exact physical value), most people don't need the IPD adjustment (hence the Rift S's lack of it).",oculus

If you compare his recent videos to [Oprah's viewership in the USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show#United_States_viewership), I'd say Oprah is likely significantly more famous, though maybe not comparing just outside the USA.

Index seems promising with a wider field of view. Tbh- that was what I was hoping for the S which although they aren't calling it CV2 but like a between iteration- it sure seems like a CV2 to me. I wouldn't mind the same clarity as CV1 with S- if they gave us a bigger FOV. The biggest immersion breaker is feeling like you are wearing a diving bell with the limited FOV. Index at least has ""up to"" 130 degrees vs 90-100 degrees. The higher Hz is also intriguing.

But Quest is significantly heavier with lack or rigidity at the back of the strap means it doesn't catch my scull untill the pressure is a bit too high.

Comfort is the biggest drawback for me when it comes to Quest.

I still love it and use it more than other HMDs but it is a con of that HMD especially for longer play sessions.

And there are ways to make it better but while those mods help in a noticeable way they don't even approach comfort of Rift CV1.

"I recently borrowed a Rift S to play GTA V with and it's my new favourite headset. I already own a Quest, Vive and I had an OG Rift which died.

The Quest with link cable would be great if it was your only headset but it can't match the Rift S for comfort or convenience. Maybe when the Link software is out of beta it might be solid but it occasionally fails to connect and basically adds friction to ""I want to use VR now"".

There's circles engraved into the lenses, and even if you clean them perfectly, it still is the same if not worse clarity than the Rift. 

My only gripe with it, though, is that it relies on USB power instead of using a powered base station like the Vive. With my old mobo (ASUS P8Z77-V Pro), there wasn't enough power to run through a usb extender.

"I'm using a laptop with a GTX 1060 6GB (desktop version), i7 7700HQ, and 16GB of RAM @ 2600mhz. This is using Oculus Link and I can run Pavlov just fine.",oculus
Nice! Thanks! I’m adding another 8gb ram and an SSD soon.,oculus
To piggy back off this guy's post. Does the rift S come with any free games after registering the device?,oculus
What are you sinking about?,oculus
Damn you're defensive. Think what he means is you prefer the untethered experience. You like pcvr. You like untethered more.,oculus
"Just for future reference, any PCVR VR should theoretically work through Link as long as your PC can run the game",oculus
Lol okay. Is the screen really a huge improvement?,oculus
Uninstall rift device drivers in device manager for both devices listed. One has drivers the other only let's you uninstall device. Restart. Turn off antivirus software and windows defender. Then open oculus remove headset from devices then add new headset.,oculus
"evga supernova series and corsair modular series are both good. power supplies are important because if you get a crappy one, other things might catch on fire.",oculus
"I'm trying to install the ""Robo Recal Mod Kit"" so I can get this mod loaded, but for some reason the Epic Game store won't let me. Is there an alternative place to get it from?",oculus
"I belive 3dof poisoned the well. Even stable performing GO made some people nauseous in seconds.

When people are dismissive of VR you have to press them and explain it.

Some people's first and only VR was something horrible like GearVR on an actual Rollercoaster.

I wish oculus invested more into retail, Microsoft used to have a demo agent showing wmr st best buys.
At least there are Microsoft stores with wmr.

There's no retail space to try the index or even just the quest, as far as I know. And I live in a major city",oculus
if you haven:t used rakuten before,oculus
Dude thank you so much for simplifying it for me.,oculus
"Ill probably get it, I set a very high bid. (probably overpaying tbh) But just in case tell me more",oculus
Now is the time to go in there with headphones. An extra cable isn't so bad if you wrap it up with the others. Give it a shot,oculus
Thanks,oculus
Thanks,oculus
Then why are you acting like I'm saying things rudely and downvoting me when you're the one who seems a little agitated and down voting?,oculus
Not sure if you've done it yet but try plugging one into usb 2.0,oculus
Hmm I’ll try thanks,oculus
"That looks good now. Get a 650W and then use the remaining budget for a cheap HDD. I am also building a PC now and is currently buying the parts over the months. Haven't decided on what graphic card I should get. For reference here's my building-in-progress PC specs.

"It's very different and the netcode is miles ahead of Pavlov's (which honestly is massively shit). Also much better weapon handling feel in my eyes and the play modes really put it way up there for me.

Still worth it for bot play alone, but what a shame it didn't get as popular. Even the interface for adding bots to your online games was clear and easy to use.",oculus
That is encouraging... thanks,oculus
"It’s in pretty much perfect condition, it comes with 3 sensors, the OG box, touch controllers, and a washable VR cover. Asking $225 plus shipping",oculus
Thanks for the link!,oculus
"I agree with this, even if you are careful the lenses will eventually get scratched. Better to get custom VR lenses or pick up some contacts (I do this personally, but hear great things about custom lenses as well)",oculus
"How many do they have allotted for those countries, I mean you can sell out if you only had 12.  Not saying this is the case, I'm just asking for facts.",oculus
I’m agitated because I made a mistake and people are getting pissed off at it. I’m also not even downvoting but I’ll let you believe what you want to.,oculus
"Looks like something that will never perform at 90hz in VR. Have fun making it regardless, I guess.",oculus
The hits were Big screen and SLR (from sidequest),oculus
It may be in the way that you escalated this in your own head and people are noticing it. No worries though bro have a happy rest of your Thanksgiving.,oculus
Thank you very much,oculus
Is it a CV1 or a Rift S? I’m personally curious if the Quest + Link would be a decent upgrade over my CV1 (which is getting oldish at this point and im just too lazy to set it up right now) and am thinking about getting one while they’re bundling it with the Star Wars VR experience. I’m also on vacation right now so I’d have the added benefit of using VR while home for the holidays.,oculus
"If he thinks games should be communal, how does that explain Microsoft buying Obsidian and just releasing The Outer Worlds ... a 100% single player game.",oculus
"All the other suggestions are good, but clearly the correct thing to do is soak the faceplate in sharpie ink.",oculus
"The CPU mark score for my processor is higher than the score for the Oculus recommended Intel CPU, so it's not that bad.",oculus
Money. It's just funny to me he says VR causes a rift between people yet single player games do this worse.,oculus
The quest is not going on sale.,oculus
"whatever is in your HDMI port, move it that to your dongle adn give the HDMI port itself to the Rift.",oculus
"Surely it has at least one HDMI? If your monitor is using it, run the monitor through the adapter and run the HMD straight through off the HDMI on the card",oculus
"It's very new, and the GO and Rift\_S are both on sale now, so if there was one coming i'd expect it would have already. I think margins are thin on it so it may well not go on sale for a long time",oculus
"Wow that looks super amazing.


However regardless of how optimized that grass is I feel like it will reduce accessibility/performance, unless it can still get pushed down to really crappy levels",oculus
how were you able to get the student discount applied also? when I do it it just shows $349 again,oculus
"Probably not.

But if you have a USB3.1 gen2 port WITH DISPLAY PORT passthru that MIGHT work.  Or if you have a thunderbolt3 that also MIGHT work.   The MIGHT qualifier is if those ports have direct access to your discrete GPU or do they go to yoru incompatible integrated GPU.

The new Vive Cosmos is Displayport as well, as is the Index and RiftS.  Only the older gen VR systems are HDMI.",oculus
And still it does ;) Thanks!,oculus
"On lenovo site?  I just clicked the thingy and did their ID verification thing, worked fine for me.  Brought the base price down to $331 or something",oculus
"It applies to any AUTHORIZED reseller.

So if you buy it on amazon being sold by amazon, yes it applies.  But if you're buying on amazon from a 3rd party seller using amazon, no, it doesn't apply.",oculus
Thanks man this worked much love,oculus
Ok thanks probably just going to get the quest or a used vive,oculus
yeah. and ugh ok lemme try a different browser,oculus
"No you can't split the DP.  Your GPU likely has other ports, get a dongle and plug your screen into one of those other ports.",oculus
The only deal involved with the quest is they are including all 3 episodes of Vader Immortal.,oculus
Welcome to the edge of VR lol,oculus
"Quest is a stand along VR video game console, it doesn't require a PC at all.",oculus
"Everything has just been tough lately, I’m sorry for how I acted. Have a good thanksgiving as well.",oculus
"""as far as we know"" still isn't something many would be comfortable risking their kids future eye development on.   
The accommodation/vergence issue all current VR headsets concerns me even as an adult user.",oculus
Might also just look for a original oculus,oculus
Not specifically for Rift or Quest no.  But you can retrofit the Vive deluxe audio headstrap to your Oculus HMD with some velcro with decent results.   Plus you get actual earphones with that strap.  It's about a hundred bucks.,oculus
no,oculus
"Greetings, do you know if the Oculus home software is still running even when you are not using the controllers?  Also the best practice would be to remove the batteries when your not using the controllers for an extended period of time.  Also if you are using a cheaper brand of batteries these will run out faster.",oculus
"Developers decide individually if they support cross buy or not.  As long as yous etup your quest with the same account as your rift, any games that support cross buy will be in your quest store for $0.  But expect that most you will need to re-buy yes.",oculus
Hahaha,oculus
"Check your device manager and make sure you have a USB controller that is not ASMedia or VIA  .  Neither are compatible with Rift.

Otherwise though your system looks good to go.",oculus
Better than spreading myths that are unsupported by scientific evidence.,oculus
"I feel hover should stop you no matter how far your hands are. I keep floating forward making the skill useless. Also anyway to respect on my own. I love the game, but can't find people online. Wish it had custom rooms. Apart from that I wish they add more melee ability, like a sword or arm laser and a heat discharge punch or something. Tie nicely into the electricity vs overheat theme. The ripping out the health on enemy's backs is cool, but old why it kills them or heals you. Nanobots are in those right. Then there's my big issue which is being limited on unlockable modifications, no matter how many times you play through. I felt you should be able to unlock more mod slots by more growth. Picking a silly one like hover and seeing it doesn't work right then your stuck that play through with crap and it makes you want to restart over.",oculus
"Your USB controller chip set is likely asmedia or VIA which are incompatible.

Your only fix is to get a compatible expansion card with USB3.0 ports.",oculus
Probably using it to watch vr porn. You should probably sanitize it.,oculus
"Ya, I would really like a more polished version of sairento. Like the matrix vr. Oooo",oculus
If you buy it from somewhere with a decent return policy like amazon or bestbuy.. sure.,oculus
"You can get a accuracy upgrade. Sadly sairento never had people playing multiplayer.... dunno why. But I felt the body in sairento was janky. Also the hands hold the guns badly, and the guns had no kick ECT. The gameplay is great, but even with the massive options list it lacks a lot of polish. Also I wish reloading was better.",oculus
"No.  VRChat is poorly optimized for one thing, pavlov is better optimized but by no means great.  Beat Saber needs high performance or your rhythm is going to be off when it pauses.

Your GPU needs more oomph.  You'l be able to play optimized games and older stuff reasonably well but you should really get more power.  It technically doesn't meet the current minimum spec which is 1050Ti.  However like 3 years ago min spec was a gtx 900 series so you can run OLD stuff, but none of the stuff you listed here i think will run well.",oculus
"yep, it can't run offline tho. so if you want to play alone go online and just set a pin",oculus
"uhhh no.  That laptop with a 970m In it i'd be shocked if the external ports have access to the dGPU they more than likely go to your integrated and incompatible GPU.

What you should be buying is a Quest, or a better laptop and RiftS.",oculus
I get mine Monday :D,oculus
"Oh that's good to know. I haven't gotten too far just yet.

Yeah, I wasn't a fan of the body. I had to turn off the body (floating hands) because my arms are longer than the model's when it's calibrated for my height. That being said I don't find having a torso to be incredibly important in high mobility games.",oculus
"Quest would be a good option.  I'd recommend against a Rift CV1 though because you can't get the tether cable anywhere its out of production.  And eBay scalpers want 150 bucks for it because of that.

So if you life in a house with animals, rats, kids, don't want to maintain the cable after every play session pussin gthe twists out of it then you prob should stay away from a CV1.   If you do buy one, spend a couple bucks and get one of those woven cable sleeves to put over it to give it a bit mroe protection.",oculus
"I just bought Doom 3 BFG and modded it for VR. I know its kind of old news now, but it looks and plays beautifully on the Rift S. One of the funnest things I've done in VR so far. Check out this video for details on how to install the hi res pack to make it look even better:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgwes2c\_KK4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgwes2c_KK4) 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also second calls to try out Asgard's Wrath. By far the meatiest and most 'complete' game on VR I've tried. Other notable mentions which you've no doubt already come across:

* Lone Echo: great example of VR with high-production values but it does get a little samey and the back half of the game is less interesting than the first half.
* Moss: this game is beautiful and a pretty low impact seated experience (and trust me, VR can get exhausting so its nice to have something chill).
* Dirt 2: This is the best driving game i've tried so far. Highly immersive and runs a treat on Oculus after an update.
* Superhot VR: a no brainer and very easy to pick up and play.
* Beat Saber: this is the best 'show your friends' game. Very much worth working out how to download and install custom tracks. But it does take some work to get setup.
*",oculus
"I'm going there this Sat for their xmas event. There are still [tickets available](http://retrocomputermuseum.co.uk/) if anyone wants to go (details in the blue bar at the top of the website) and meet up with myself and Gary from VRRT.

David Pleasance (used to be the MD of Commodore), and Ravi Abbott from the Retro Hour Podcast have their names down to attend as well. Worth a trip if you're into your retro gaming and want to check out the old Virtuality machines as well.",oculus
"My son laughed as well.

 I am 64 years old, child, and I have been gaming since commodore 64s and TRS80s from Radioshack for 4 thousand bucks. Recently, I came into some money I built myself, My wife and him a machine, My wife and I got VR and my son says no one Uses it and he did not want a head set with his computer he said NO ONE wants it. 

Now a days, every time I come home, him and his friends are in the basement using MY VR headset and some strange kid is sitting on my bed (On my wifes computer) using her VR. He had the chance when I had the money to get him one,. I think this Christmas I will get him one:) So these damn kids will stay off mine:)

 \~Gaming when you are of an old age, not only prevents your motor skills from regressing/declining, I find it keeps my mind sharp, but always allows me to stay young @t heart and that to me is worth all its weight in gold, so I may stay. \~Forever Young.",oculus
I don’t have a PC... that’s the issue for those of us talking about money.,oculus
When you go to your library just hover over the first game (it will be the last one played) and it will tell you how long ago was the last time you played it.,oculus
Thanks for the advice I really want to stay away from the quest for the main reason that it can’t play half life Alyx or it hasn’t be announced for it things change I know and I also don’t want a vive cause it doesn’t have access to the oculus store and requires more setup and I know the oculus CV1 also requires some set up but it would have access to half life alyx and have access to the oculus store and it is out of prediction but the oculus store sent me to amazon and there are a few left that are as much as the oculus rift s actually alittle less so idk leaning towards CV1 or a used vive,oculus
"Guessing you have 8 now?  I didn't realize I needed 16 until I got 16 and later wound up back on 8 for a week or so.  SSD is great, I can't go back to spinning rust.",oculus
"From what I've read/watched, they seem pretty adamant we've only seen a slice of the game and there will be more enemy variety.

You aren't the only one who's skeptical. It's not like there is a preorder bonus or anything, matter as well wait at least a few days after release to get some impressions and reviews.",oculus
"Rechargable AA batteries, like Eneloops. The rift s controllers eat through batteries.",oculus
my recommendation is to stay inside your play area,oculus
"Oculus and Facebook servers are having issues currently. Either the email is in a queue to send or failed to send, or your order didn't go through.",oculus
"No, they dropped games that came with CV1, but unless things have changed you still get Quill and Medium (drawing and sculpting apps).",oculus
Skip it and make sure the headset is unplugged too,oculus
Use discord. You know each other’s names. Different games work differently. Don’t know gun heart,oculus
"Elite dangerous is amazing in VR and in 2D.  Onward is great, but I've only played with friends, so I'm not sure what the playerbase is like.",oculus
"so elite dangerous is worth the buy? The base game
is $8 and the game + season pass is $15",oculus
"perhaps, though lack of evidence is not evidence against.  The jury is still very much out.

If we consider the relative potential costs of each view:  
people are cautious about putting kids in VR  
vs  
Kids use tech where health effects are unknown and end damaging their eyes.

the costs of the latter are far too high to take on a lack of data",oculus
How do you all measure your IPD? And in my mind I’m just looking for a VR experience that looks like 4K quality and will run smooth. I know that the Index has 120hz compared to the 80hz but does that mean just lower FPS and latency? Because what I’m hearing is that the 80hz rift looks crispy,oculus
"I agree, but there’s a lot of sensitive people around here who bought a Rift S and don’t like to admit they bought a dying HMD.",oculus
"&gt;This is also usually the part where you find out if they can handle VR movement or not lol. It's kind of funny when people try to move and you can tell because they instantly jerk, or make some other kind of movement when they start moving.",oculus
Where do I see this? Is it an extra $10 cashback or $10 off my order?,oculus
"Bet I’d probably just grab the rift s then because I feel you on that, they will have new consoles in like 2 years. But is the rift s capable of coming out with software updates that actually improves things? Like can they just release a hand tracking update for it in the future if they somehow figured it out without needing extra cameras.",oculus
"Over 100 games. Not as many as PC, but nothing to sneeze at.",oculus
"Very true, I didn't think about latency.",oculus
from normal reality lol,oculus
"Get the season pass.    It has all the extras from the Horizons expansion like planetary landings and such.

The game itself has a sim feel to it.   You are basically just a random pilot in the milky way.   You can do bounty hunting, mining, exploration,  etc.   And everything in the game is massive.",oculus
Oh damn I didn’t know they could just drop updates like that,oculus
I would say no unless you travel a lot and I mean like a lot a lot of traveling,oculus
"The Quest has really opened up FUN 6DOF to the masses. My brother and I bought a Rift and Vive (mr Rift one Vive). That’s all who bought into VR in my “circle”

People who have bought the quest in my life: me, my brother, my best friend, my brother in law, and my other brother in law.

We need to do everything we can to elevate the Quest and get more games sold on their platform! That’s where the real revolution in VR is happening.

Would I like to play Half Life VR this spring? Sure! That said there’s no way I’m going back to a wire.

Plus, I can’t wait to play Echo VR on the quest soon. FUCK it would piss me off in a match when I’d snag on the cord.",oculus
Anything other than eating to survive and helping others not starve is a waste of money. How we waste it is up to us.,oculus
"i hear its very long and sometimes boring .. I might get it to try it out to see what the hype
is about ..",oculus
Yes,oculus
"Lmao I didn’t mean it like that, but people just always use the price of the Index in their argument. I’ll probably get the rift s tho since they’re probably gunna have a new console in like a year. I just want a crispy HD vr experience, and maybe get sweaty in Pavlov and I heard rift s looks good still. And sound isn’t a worry for me cuz I’m planning on plugging in my nice bose headphones",oculus
"Took me awhile to buy it, but Blade and Sorcery is amazing, as long as you have the space to play it in. Make sure you have enough space in your area though, because i didn’t and slammed my knuckle into a dehumidifier.",oculus
Is it as good quality as you were expecting? Cuz I just want realistic experiences not no terrible graphics,oculus
Quest is way better than the psvr is about everyway but the quest is the best headset if you don’t have a beefy pc,oculus
"i have 2 question 

1. can rift s play sideload games?
2. is it really true Rift S FOV is not as big as quest?",oculus
For sound I was planning on using my Bose headphones anyways so sound wouldn’t be a issue. I feel like no matter which one I chose i wouldnt really regret it honestly,oculus
"&gt; No Rift S specific content is being created by Oculus.  

False. We literally just got Stormland and Asgard's Wrath. Medal of Honor is on the way. Etc. Obviously these can be played on the Quest now as well with the Link but that's totally fine, I have nothing against the Quest or even for the Rift S; I like PC VR taking advantage of all the power of the PC platform and whether that's on the Rift S, Quest w/ Link or a future hybrid set is all fine and dandy with me!",oculus
What exactly is dying about it? We just got two big games and more are on the way. I'm confused..,oculus
"That's the best option, definitely, so sounds like you're prepared either way.  Keep in mind that with that IPD and how it fits on your head, it may take some adjusting to find exactly where it'll focus right.  So if it immediately feels blurry, don't despair, as you may just have to adjust height, angle (move where the knob tightens either higher or lower to adjust this), or tilt (seriously, damn thing sets on my head at an angle for whatever reason and I have to push the right sight up more it feels like).  Just don't be stubborn and give yourself a migraine.  After tinkering and you still can't get it to feel right, look into the other option.",oculus
So what if I was planning on using my Bose headphones from the start??,oculus
"Idgaf. Anything to push the development and adoption of the technology into the world. The quicker that happens the better the tech, and the more experiences that will be available to us.",oculus
"Sorry I misspoke, no more Rift S specific content is being “green lit”.

They’re just trying to get those “out of the way” so to speak. Sure, they’re proud of those releases, but they know that not very many people will get to experience them so they’re not that important to them.

The only “saving grace” to those titles is they are now functional on the Quest, but they won’t amount to any substantial extra sales.",oculus
They have a 30 day return policy,oculus
When I order directly through the Oculus site?,oculus
"Theres no real ending or anything.    The story of the game just kind of keeps unfolding as time goes on.  Like, there was a massive community event recently where thousands of ships went on an expedition and I think they ended up building a station out there somewhere.   And there were aliens that started attacking ships and stations.  

I have hundreds of hours in the game and most of those hours are just kind if flying around to look at stuff intermixed with some combat.",oculus
i dont understand how a hmd can die? unless they kill the hardware after a certain time it kinda just exists to play whatever you put on it,oculus
There is not much content coming from Oculus. If there are titles released specific to PC VR it will be from other studios.,oculus
Haha that sounds awesome. And I thought the rift uses steam VR?,oculus
"Yes . https://support.oculus.com/1561641360808317/

&gt; We'll issue a refund for Oculus devices returned within 30 days from when your order was dispatched.",oculus
I have a 58 IPD and have no problems playing for hours.,oculus
"&gt; it can't play half life Alyx

https://www.half-life.com/en/alyx/vr

&gt; Oculus Quest with PC and Link Cable",oculus
interesting i might give it ago since its a huge discount right now,oculus
"Good fucking lord I'm still baffled by how slick that thing looks, especially given the quality inside. Daddy Zucky I'm so ready to get that thing on my face. I'll drop however much money I need to for it.",oculus
When you make an account on Rakuten your first purchase using it gives you a bonus $10 rebate. I just used it an hour ago to buy the rift off Lenovo and I got 12% cash back. I already uses Rakuten so I didn’t get the bonus $10.  If you’d like to use my referral so you can get an additional $10 let me know and it’s help me out a bit.,oculus
"I’m new to VR, what are these abbreviations I’m seeing? 

DK1, DK2, and CV1?",oculus
No softwares are running,oculus
Perfect. Thank you very much!,oculus
"So, I talked to a rep and they arent able to add the student/whatever discount on top because its already discounted. guess you guys just got lucky.
But, if you have a discover it card they have 5% back on amazon (technically 10% if youre in your first year, they double it at the end) which apparently can be triggered by using amazon pay, which luckily lenovo.com has.",oculus
Well I am proven wrong sorry,oculus
"2560 x 1440 Rift S

 2880x1600 index",oculus
Nope.,oculus
"Plenty of people are running stuff at 144hz, thats why they can afford and use an Index.",oculus
No need to do anything.,oculus
Don't expect a lot of people speaking up for Index in this sub though.,oculus
Reference? I don't understand,oculus
Might redraw your guardian,oculus
"I like showing them the Blu, Dreams of Dali and Richie's (just to torture some of them a bit)...",oculus
I'd hope I enjoy it after dropping 400$ haha. I'm sure I'll enjoy it. Not buying this all right now just wanted ideas so I can make a list of future purchases,oculus
"I've been fiddling with my Quest + Link for a few days now and it cannot be any LESS fiddly than the Rift S.  I can get it working on some games, but if something doesn't quite go right, it's \~5 minutes just trying to give it a second attempt.  Link has some amazing potential, but if you're expecting smoother sailing with Link at this time while it's in Beta vs Rift S, you may be disappointed.",oculus
"I think the key part of the quote is: ophthalmologists agree there is no reason to be concerned that VR headsets will damage eye development, health or function.",oculus
"I think your argument is just fundamentally flawed. 

You may be right in that no more wired headsets would be coming, and S will be the last wired one. But who says you can't plug a WiFi adapter into an S? In the same way they just plugged a cable into a Quest to turn it into an S? 

If wireless were in near future, why would Oculus go through the trouble of wiring up Quest? Suggests wireless headsets, at least from Oculus, are still quite a ways off, a couple of years probably.

That S is discounted and Quest isn't could be easily explained by Quest costing more to make. They can afford to discount S, since it has no hardware built into it, but not Quest, which does.

Quest, without link or wireless streaming, is grossly inferior to S in terms of games it can run, and image quality. With streaming, it is still grossly inferior. With link, it is slightly inferior. Notice how many times I said inferior? And you think people who bought S are the ones who made a mistake?

Finally, comfort is a huge thing. Quest feels awful (to me), S is very comfy, I can wear it for 2+ hrs at a stretch without any discomfort at all. I can't last 30 mins in Quest. 

Given a choice, today, of getting a Rift S or Quest, knowing all I know, I would still go with Rift S. For wired PCVR, it is still the better choice in terms of refresh, pixel density, comfort, etc. This would be with the understanding that this headset will last me a couple of years, until next gen comes along, be it Oculus, Valve or whoever.

And nobody is going to shoot the messenger when messenger isn't shouting utter nonsense. To suggest that S will somehow ""die"" is as asinine as saying NVidia 1080 is going to die. You want me to embrace wireless future? Show me how I can play Asgard, wireless, today, with the kind of image quality and performance that Rift S provides, on a Quest.",oculus

In those cases its best to always buy them from Steam, because the workshop content wont obviously work for Oculus store content.",oculus

"The big flaw in your counter is you don’t see how the Oculus Link cable is the nail in the coffin for the Rift S. 

Now that the Quest can run Rift games with a superior screen, there is no need for the Rift S and that’s the reason they went into it with Lenovo. They knew that they didn’t want to put that many resources into the Rift S.

Next Fall my prediction is Oculus will release their official wireless solution for PC VR to the Quest, and they won’t do so for the Rift S.

This of course will anger many but it’s a necessary evil to get rid of the Rift S (like Oculus wants to) and focus on only one headset.",oculus

There are a few out there but the ones I used were Virtual Desktop and ALVR. The quality of the stream were completely dependent on the games and the PC, but all these streaming apps required a 5ghz connection through the router because the 2ghz wouldn't handle it. 

Just to clarify. You don't need internet to stream. You just need your Quest and PC on the same router to communicate.

For those who didn't have a PC some were using the streaming service Shadow to rent a PC online, put steamvr on it, then stream the games from there to their Quest. Only the ones with good internet had good results with this.",oculus

"The Rift S has 3 subpixels per pixel (red, green, blue) whereas the Quest has 2 (red, green or blue, green).  So if you look at 2 horizontal pixels there will be 6 subpixels (R,G,B,R,G,B) on the Rift S and 4 subpixels (R,G,B,G) on the Quest.  Horizontally, the Quest would need 6/4 = 1.5 times the resolution of the Rift S to have an equal number of subpixels.  That would be 1.5\*2,560 = 3,840 pixels.  But the Quest only has 2,880 pixels.  This is offset somewhat by the fact that the Quest has separate displays for each eye, whereas the Rift S has more wasted pixels between eyes due to its single display.  Also, on the Quest the Red subpixels and the Blue subpixels are about twice as wide as the Green subpixels.    


However, the black space on each side of the Quest Green subpixels is about twice as large as the space between the subpixels on the Rift S.  So you have a double-wide black bar, a single wide Green bar, and a double-wide black bar. Think of the black bars as the wire on a screen door.  And you are looking at the world thru the screen door from close up.  You double the size of the wire, the more obvious the screen door effect (SDE).  That is why the Quest has worse SDE than the Rift S and the Oculus Go.  Also, the further away something is on the other side of the screen door the more noticeable the effect.  For example, if you are looking at someone that is close up there will not be hardly any noticeable difference (i.e. get in the character's face).  But if you are looking at someone in the distance (e.g. across the room) whose entire face is not many pixels, the difference in subpixels sticks out like a sore thumb.  It can also make reading text difficult.  For example, in Agard's Wrath when you are up on a ledge overlooking the ocean you can easily see where it says Hold Y to become a god if you are on a Rift S.  But on the Oculus, you probably won't make out the Y and if you are on a pretty high ledge you probably won't make out the word Hold.",oculus

It absolutely is. Even leaving the upfront costs, the ""upkeep"" of getting a few games a month, without sailing high seas, is significantly more expensive than one good game at 60$ bucks a month, at probably less playtime. Now don't get me wrong, I was fucking blown away when I put the headset on for the first time yesterday, and I don't regret spending the money on a decent GPU and the headset, but seeing the prices for games and some in-app purchases makes me laugh.

In terms of clarity the Rift S wins. Or course with an OLED the Quest will produce superior contrast. The subpixel arrangement of the Quest makes SDE more pronounced even with the higher pixel count.

Or I guess you could always go to an optician/optometrist and ask if they could measure yours, it takes about 30 seconds.

120Hz will indeed reduce larency (and somewhat offset the fact that LCD screens inherently have higher latency than OLED screens found in first gen headsets and the Quest). It will also make fast motion smoother and clearer, and increase the sense of ""presence"" because it looks a bit more like real life and less like a screen.

But as you said, the Rift S is already fine, it's not like it will be a night and day difference, and keep in mind that even with good hardware you won't be able to push every game at 120fps (Although if you start dropping frames in 120Hz you should fall to 60fps, which is probably more acceptable than dropping to 40fps, so there's that).

What you actually see when your IPD isn't exactly matched to the headset, is a little bit of blur/fringing. But the degree of that blur might be so slight that it doesn't really effect the apparent resolution of the displays, which are of course still fairly low in this current generation. So A Rift S may be absolutely fine for you.   


Quest may give you a more ""perfect"" experience, but the Rift S has a greater effective sharpness anyway so it might even out. It sucks there's no easy way for everyone to demo both. I know none of this is particularly helpful, just some stuff to think about.

"Does it happen in every game or just when people play Beat Saber?

Every time I see this happening in Beat Saber its just the person looking down at their hands.

Because you mentioned your primary interest in rally and flight sims the Quest’s 72hz refresh rate may wind up being a pretty big issue. I myself can’t stand the lower refresh rate for racing games on the Quest (with Link) and the Rift S at 80hz makes them slightly more tolerable.,oculus

Actually, never had a loss of tracking among the 2 dozen or so games I've tried so far. As for the IPD issue,  I agree - a bummer... and where the CV1 has an advantage. In terms of screen quality, once I played with the Rift S, then went back to my CV1, I noticed two things:

1) The CV1 has that deeper black, being OLED - makes the colors pop a bit more.  
2) The Rift S screen was much sharper, little to no God Rays,  and a barely visible screen door effect. Sure, the blacks can sometimes look like the darkest gray, but that's a small sacrifice,  and becomes a non concern when you're playing.

I'm waiting on my Index and have read so many horror stories about extending cables. Seems like the most reliable thing to do is get a optical/fiber displayport cable. I'm hoping not to spend nearly that much money, since I'm not looking to go nearly as far as some.

My plan is:  
\- [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D949F59/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D949F59/) \- same repeater as you, claims to be DP1.4 compliant so hoping it has no bandwidth issues.

"That's probably one major reason, yes. Beat Saber is almost certainly the most popular game across both Rift and Quest. It is featured in pretty much every ad for the Oculus platform. It has very high brand recognition for a VR game. 

They don't want to lose that to another publisher. It also means that future sales on PSVR, Steam etc will be earning profit for them. As others have mentioned, there is a lot of potential to build on the existing foundation.

In the long run, this could just be the first of several acquisitions. It's been rumored and hinted that Facebook is acquiring other studios. They want to beef up their developer portfolio to encourage people to buy into the Oculus ecosystem and fend off competition. As a small studio, it was probably fairly quick to acquire Beat Games. I expect we'll see Oculus acquiring other studios next year.",oculus

CTF, TDM, DM, GunGame, Infection mode where a couple of players are wall and ceiling-climbing zombies with high HP and no firearms and a pretty good BR mode too.

"Can cause conflict between some of the oculus SDK optimisations, like ASW and steamVR equivalents (motion smoothing/reprojection). Also more likely to run into issues with multiple resolution scaling setting scattered in different places.  
When using an oculus headset with oculus SDK there's a certain consistency across the entire software-hardware chain, while using steamVR means there's another layer of software from a third party that data is being translated through, which can be the source of conflicts. This can translate into slightly better/more consistent performance using Oculus SDK with oculus headsets.

"This looks great, but will hold off on pre-ordering. Last time I contemplated pre-ordering a game, the reddit world suggested that I not, and they were right. I waited a couple of weeks after the release date, and sure enough it was something like 10-12 dollars less on sale than the pre-order discount would have been. Since then, I don't ever pre-order a game. 

Besides, my backlog of games that I don't have time to play already is lengthy, so no shortage of games to play right now. I can wait a little longer for it to go on sale for the first time. :)",oculus

"Lol, Shroud is so bad at these games and rages so hard about something he hasn't spent a day practicing. People don't even begin to understand the differences between aiming a dot at someone's head and learning the basics of how to get headshots without really aiming down the sights and all the intricacies.

Shroud raged a ton and still doesn't even bother aiming for their heads, which makes people who are used to winning all the the more frustrated and increases the likelihood of them turning other people off even more.

Pair that with the fact that people have no clue about what VR really is and them thinking it's some kind of glorified 3D-TV tech and you know why the audience is so small.

Chat interaction, if anything, is easier in VR though, why would that be more difficult?",oculus
I'd buy it from my local best buy but their return policy is crazy. 7 days on electronics and 14 days for normal items.,oculus

use open composite for that game which boosts performance a lot.

other then taht it works out of the box, full touch support and is one of the best vr games out there esp. when you are an fallout fan. just standing in this detailed world is absolutly great and i swear when you stand first time before codsworth you will see how awesome this is.

dont wonder when some controls are not working as they should at the beginning, its just the turorial before the shelter run that is a little off.",oculus

"It is absolutely helpful! Supplies are expensive too--especially large canvases that can run upwards of $100 each. Everybody enjoys big art, but no one wants to *pay* for that big canvas. Letting people create large works of art easily without sacrificing their experience would be a fantastic solution. You could even pair with certain paint brands to advertise their colors in your game. Also, brush companies! There's all kinds of solutions for that.

I also recommend letting people upload their work onto a private cloud service (like maybe if they sign into Dropbox?) so they can save large-scale work without it sacrificing space on their Quest.

I even think something like this could work to have a virtual drawing desk or virtual tablet. Let people work on limited-layer drawings if they can't get a Wacom Intuos right away.

"That's certainly a creative solution, but unfortunately it seems like the oculus only allows for 2 channel plugs. So a 3-channel cord that includes mic won't provide mic to the mix. Best suggestion is if you can get/find a USB headset for like $20 it'll save you the pain.",oculus

Vibes light houses combined with their active markers, and a Kinect sensor bar. The Vibes light houses and sensors work great as it is like a mini mocap studio, but obviously cost some money and space. Kinect is far and away a hacky solution as the device is no longer made, and the cameras on it are of low resolution so accuracy is not its strength. The software is crowd sourced, too. 

In the future, the onboard processor of the rift quest should open up finger tracking... but those cameras are likely not going to make heads or tails of your body for many years to come.",oculus

"- Asgard's Wrath is a f*** classic, amazing and spectacular in every possible way.

- Defector was a great game. About 5 hours long, super fun and with a pricetag of $20. It wasn't 60 or 40, it was $20. I understand the disappointment for people who were expecting a 20-hour game but you get your money's worth with it.

- Stormland: Best traversal I've seen in any game, great mechanics and a lot of fun. Even if you only play it for 15 hours and don't play any cycles it's totally worth the money.

It's a bit different with games but playing something for 1-2 hours and then refund it, unless of course is due to technical issues, it's a bit odd, let alone write a review about it having seen only a very small part of the game; things take time, a slow start can lead many times to a great ending.

"Rift S for me, the Quest was fairly uncomfortable to me, being too front heavy. As someone that is most just playing the top end games on PC, I almost always going to be tethered. Rift S also has a slightly higher refresh rate, you don’t have the minor issues of link (rare instances of age compression, and sometimes seeing the edge of the render region if you move your head too fast), you also get better tracking, a reduced screen door effect due to the arrangement of the pixel, and no god rays from bright areas on dark backgrounds.

Overall the Rift S is the best product for me, I had a Quest and returned it due to the difference I described above. But the Quest is still a fantastic product and it is for you if you don’t a gaming PC (yet, there is link now so if you get one in the future you can move to that), or if you think the portability is super useful.

The Pimax's 170 FOV is amazing but it comes with a lot of technical bugs and it's Your Miles May Vary on how many hours you need to tinker with it.

Where can you see the player count like that?,oculus
"I've had the Rift since DK1 - and the answer is simple - the Quest. With the new Quest Link you can use it as a Rift S, and it works amazingly well if you have the PC for it (mainly have a newer Nvidia card with a USB C port). I own the Quest, I use it all the time, I own a Rift CV1 that I haven't used in nearly a year. Two of my friends have a Rift S, and outside of the easy setup, they have never sounded overly impressed, in particular because of the garbage screen with terrible black levels. 

That's my opinion, but it's based on using this stuff for years. I can not overstate how big of a difference it makes to not have a cord - it's game changing. But if you want to play PCVR, well you can do so with a USB C cable. I think the reason the Rift S is on-sale is because it's not selling well and with the Quest Link software I don't really know what the point of it is anymore. It has slightly better tracking - but if that's the big thing then get a CV1 which has much better tracking (and a 90hz screen and an OLED display with the tradeoff being a bit lower res screen + more difficult setup).",oculus
Yes and new releases (like espire 1 recently) have like 10-20 players currently playing. I doubt the game moved more then 1000 copies on steam. Total failure financially,oculus
"It's been on my radar too, but only after a blip some time ago, there really hasn't been much about it since so I'm a little skeptical...",oculus
"Might be just a problem with the CV1, never heard of this kind of issue. Weird.",oculus
What referral program? Did they offer legit money?,oculus
I’ll check it out,oculus
"A USB port that supplies 3A of power will charge the Quest and keep it charged. If the port supplies 1.5A, it will drastically slow the battery depletion to &lt;10% per hour while playing, from my observations. 9 to 10 hours of play time on a single charge while connected to a 1.5A port should be more than enough for any single session.",oculus

"\~3.5 yrs from today. The refresh headsets released at about the 3 year mark.

&amp;#x200B;

I disagree though. Sure, the 2019 headsets aren't the overall upgrade we all hoped for (not Gen 2 w/ eye tracking, 2k panels), but there's still major progress that was made in just 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Valve**:

* Biggest improvements: Knuckles controllers and the Index HMD offering multiple refresh rates
* Marginal improvements: Lighthouse 2.0 increases room-scale to 30x30 ft and increased accuracy. Valve continues to offer the best external tracking system.
* Compromises (w/ trade offs): none

&amp;#x200B;

**Oculus**:

* Biggest improvements: Oculus Insight Tracking. Oculus now has the leading inside out system, overtaking WMR's 2 camera system. They released a standalone headset (deemed near impossible a few years ago) and released a black-magic like update that allows it to tether to PC. Early 2020 (4 year mark) they will release optical hand tracking for Quest (and hopefully RiftS).
* Marginal improvements: none
* Compromises (w/ trade offs): switched from headphones to piped speakers. Rift S switched to a static IPD system but included an eye relief (I personally would rather have the eye relief since I wear glasses). Touch controllers are lighter, but also more prone to damage.",oculus
"15% ""other""? What is this ""other"" even? Pimax? The MS headset? PSVR? imho there should have been more options in the poll, now the bigges block (of people who actually have VR) is a big black box :(",oculus
Pavlov is great on the quest,oculus
I remember back on the DK1 software IPD definitely did change the experience you could start to see crosseyed if it was set too high or low. However I never even touched the option on the Rift S yet because it looked ready to go at default settings,oculus

"nah is not super good video, it's really more like pcvr user perspective of vr  
i literally do not get how peoples can say ""if you have good gaming pc get rift s "" like why ?, i know person who have sli 1080 and use quest a lot and never use pcvr  
quest is more like, and i see it a lot btw , ""do i get ps4 or quest, , quest is new and vr and can connect to pc, well i will take quest ,"" and use it like a console , so it's more like vr is co device, not addon for pc  
ofc if you do have pc vr library and stuff, then you need headset for pcvr, but if you do not, quest store is really good way so start vr",oculus

nr1 pcvr don't have a lot of exclusive games, swich have more games , and if you need exclusives you can play using link or virtual desktop, all other top games like beatsaber have better quest support, like 360 mode and stuff  
nr2 . quest is super simple to use, it plays like console,  you put it on press power button, if you set you guardian you are literally in same place in game you been , you can play one song in same time it took to just to start game beatsaber game in rift s  
nr3 way more games, quest do have sidequest, go store, quest store, web games and pc - oculus and steam  
need hl1 vr, on pcvr ,good luck, quake 2 vr, maybe , quest have a lot of cool stuff you do not get on pc, and you still can use pc  
nr3 oled , do i need to tell more, beatsaber is literally black game + some colors, in lcd beatsaber look way worst  
nr4 you don't have to have display port , have good laptop but bad dp port, well rift s is out, but quest , no problem , put laptop in a bag and play using usb, and best part is, you have longer battery life, your laptop dont need to power it    
nr5 portability, we all know pc gamers are introverts sitting in dark rooms full of anime figurines , well at least my are :D , but quest is so much social, take quest and chromecast, and you are star in any party , i know it do not fit your usual pc games stereotype but yea quest are for much more for active extroverts who are happy to play and share vr   
nr6 and ofc i think is much more girl friendly device, it was noted on OC6 too but it is so true , simplicity of quest and a lot of active music games , you see how much more girl are in vr, especially ones who do not play any games at all , you see it a lot, boys try vr, yea nice device, i will go play lol now, you give it to girl and she like beatsaber!!!!!!! i need this in my life",oculus

"Every VR engineer will tell you developers should aim to have at least 90FPS in their apps.  
[Unreal Engine docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Platforms/VR/DevelopVR/ContentSetup/index.html) say this:  
""You must maintain framerate, and ideally, a little bit of a buffer to make sure you're always over the **HMD's native framerate**. Low framerates are another trigger for Simulation Sickness, so make sure to optimize your project as much as possible.""  
[Unity engine](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/vr-best-practice#5c7f8528edbc2a002053b450) goes even one step further and has this to say about reprojection:  
""Although asynchronous reprojection is enabled by default on all applications that support it, it is important for the developer to understand this feature when comes the time to debug and optimize. **Developers should never rely on this technique in place of optimization** as this technique does cause positional and animation judder.""  
Which mimics what [Oculus themselves](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-performance-guidelines/) says about reprojection:  
""**Don’t rely on Asynchronous SpaceWarp (ASW) to hit rendering frame rate**.""  
Even [hardware manufacturers like Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/introduction-to-vr-application-performance-tuning) say the same thing:  
""\[...\] if you achieve frame rates and Late Stage Reprojection (LSR) values that  reach or exceed 98 percent of the target platform and hardware spec's performance ceiling, your application performs well. Put another way,  with a maximum achievable refresh rate of 90Hz, you could attempt to achieve at least a frame rate of 88.2 fps and LSR average.""  
Even [other VR manufacturers say 90FPS is the bare minimum](https://help.irisvr.com/hc/en-us/articles/215884547-The-Importance-of-Frame-Rates).  
And that's just the bare minimum, [ATI ""won't be happy"" until we get 240Hz displays](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/49693/amds-graphics-boss-vr-needs-16k-240hz-true-immersion/index.html). While at the same time [Microsoft's research time suggests at least 1800Hz for ""perfect"" VR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/02/perfectillusion.pdf).

"The Oculus cable is in no way overpriced. The USB 3 spec limits cable length to 3m. That is a bit short for room scale VR. Anything longer than that requires active cables. Either copper with a repeater or fiber optic with transceivers in each end. 

The Oculus cable exists because of that limitation. It is a 5m long fiber cable and fiber cables are expensive. You won't find a 5m fiber USB 3 cable cheaper than that, let alone one that also supports charging and has a right angle connector on the other end. If the perfect cable for this use case existed, then Oculus wouldn't have bothered making their own. But since it doesn't exist, they did. They have also released the specs for the cable so third parties can make and sell their own, but they will be expensive too when they eventually show up.",oculus

"Yeah I don’t really understand people’s perspective that this hurts boneworks in the slightest, HL:A is most likely a 10hr + linear story and people who spent $1k+ for their headset will be looking at another VR game to get.

"That is certainly the case for non-competes for your employees (where NCs of any length are  looked upon with much skepticism by the courts), but for M&amp;A it's more on the order of a few years before the courts have traditionally quashed the covenant. *But*, that doesn't mean most agreements don't try and push the limits anyways. 


My acquisition had a 4 year non-compete. Could I have pushed back on that? Sure, but I didn't really intend to get back into the same business and it helped give me a slightly more favorable deal. Even if it's not enforceable, you can still use it as a tool in the negotiation process.",oculus
"There is nothing wrong with being wrong. I do it all the time. 😎

The problem is that deleting comments makes it look like something is being hidden.",oculus
There are many different reasons why it could make sense. One reason right off the top of my head is simulated real life paintings. Go to a virtual location and find a spot and paint a section of what you see. Maybe you want to test a studio setup with lighting and a model or maybe just a still life. I feel it could allow some people develop an eye for things instead of just copying what they see when painting things that other people have made. It being in VR could also offer a level of focus that some people need by blocking out distractions while at the same time not making you feel confined to somewhere. It is also interesting to be around other creatives if this VR app would be multiplayer. You need to think outside of the canvas. VR can put you places that otherwise some people cant go and give you things you otherwise probably wouldn't have as an option.,oculus

"Obviously the studio wasn't hurting at all, but they were still relatively small. The next game could be exclusive, but honestly a new Beat Games game is probably far in the future. And Facebook is basically the lead for VR ATM. To say they are ""in it to poach successful content for exclusivity"" might be true, but ultimately they are making the industry better. They are the driving force to lower costs in VR. If they really wanted exclusivity, they wouldn't have bought Beat Games without it.",oculus
"See I’m on the complete opposite boat where the games mechanics are similar enough (physics based puzzles with FPS combat being a focus) to the point where if someone has played one or the other, they’ll immediately have a next game to play once they finish one.

I keep seeing these virtu signaling post about vr being some type of superior platform that EVERYONE should know about, but in the grand scheme of things, 40k view, its not really taking off. Its more of a niche market. People play here and there, games arnt really mature at this stage. Only a fraction of gamers play out of the entire gaming industry. Consoles will continue to be king.  To prove my point, this time next year, the next gen consoles will overshadow anything oculus related for the next few years. No hate but its just the reality of things.

1.) Make sure your computer has a compatible display port input. Check your boards USB controller, if it's ASMedia you may need a PCI-E USB card (rare issue)

The benefit of Steam VR is that it is compatible with all the different be headsets (Oculus, WMR, Vive, Index, etc.) Whereas the Oculus store is only compatible with Oculus stuff so if you decided to change from Oculus you'll be kinda left out in the dark.

The benefit of the Oculus store is that all the games will be using the Oculus SDK so you get better performance and compatibility. However, in saying that, if the game is on the Oculus store as well as Steam, the chances are that the Steam version will also be using the Oculus SDK anyway.

"I got a Rift S a few months ago and these additions were a must imo:

1) Hand straps to make them like knuckles controllers. You don't have to be constantly gripping your controller which is nice for long play periods.

2) I primarily play beat saber so [vr cover](https://vrcover.com/product/rift-s-vr-cover/) is a must so the foam doesn't get super gross. Also I got a workout headband or else sweat will get all in your eyes

3) And since i value sound for Beatsaber, the built in speakers just don't cut it (missing bass) so I got [these clip on headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Bionik-BNK-9007-Mantis-Headphone-Playstation/dp/B0735X5M4X) originally made for PSVR.

Theyve even answered questions about the story length since the release date was announced, as a previous picture I added showed. Will they add more content? Maybe, even according to them, depending on its success. It's not a large game studio so support for it in the future will be entirely based on sales, aside from tweaks and bug stomping.

Valve is bundling half life Alyx free with all Index hardware purchases. Facebook sees this and thinks of a response - what's the most successful VR game? Beat Saber. So they could either make it free for all Oculus users by paying some per user fee (likely close to 50% retail). 

Conservatively - 200k annual headsets sold * $20/user = 4M per year in recurring licensing fees. Or they can just 5X that number and buy the studio for something like $20M, save their licensing fees, get all revenue from sales on other platforms, acquire great talent, and build a more aggressive set of partnerships for more (official) music on Beat Saber.

Yes. Flying an airplane is not difficult. I flew an airplane by myself for the first time when I was 16, before I learned to drive.

The reason learning to fly in real life is a big deal is because the stakes are a lot higher. When a car breaks down, you pull over. When an airplane breaks down, you may well die. You have to spend many days studying and then practicing:

* Weather, and how it can kill you

* Air traffic control, airspace classes, collision avoidance, etc.

* How to respond to mechanical failures

* How to not get lost",oculus

" A long time ago in a convention center far far away I sat in awe of the announcement trailer for the Vader Immortal series and last week the trilogy was finally complete! Ever since that day at OC5 I have wanted to experience being a part of the Star Wars universe and last night I finally got my chance. As a true fan of the movie series I've gotta say that ILMX labs has really created something amazing with these short VR experiences and when you put them all together they form a cool side story to the films.  

Overall there really isn't much gameplay in these experiences other than wielding a light-saber a few times and using some basic force powers which admittedly were pretty lackluster in comparison to similar mechanics being used in other VR titles these days but even with the clunky controls and small amount of interactivity the sheer scale and beautiful graphics and voice acting quickly sucked me in and made me feel as if I was the silent main character in my own Star Wars story.  

Since this series is heavier on the cinematic style than gameplay I decided to stitch all three episodes into one continuous video. This was mainly done for those fans who might not own a VR headset so that they can enjoy the story and visuals on their 2D screens. As such I have time stamped each of the episodes below so that those who do not want to watch the entire video can skip to the various episodes quickly.  

Episode I starts at: [0:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZwSlBupiOY&amp;t=53s)  

Episode II starts at: [39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZwSlBupiOY&amp;t=2381s)  

Episode III starts at: [1:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZwSlBupiOY&amp;t=4198s)  

So if you are a fan of Star Wars or just want to see some high quality cinematic VR then I highly suggest giving the Vader Immortal series a look!  \[\]-)",oculus

"I can, but the game gets pretty hectic and I end up just quick firing or shoot off beat just to survive. It doesn't really penalize you except you get a little less score.

The game feels like a wave shooter with music in the background. You can shoot to the beat, but you don't have to. It rewards what would typically be a ""miss"" in other Rythm games and gives you a ""good"" equivalent. Hitting on beat gives a ""great"" equivalent.

Compared to Audica.
You shoot off beat, you miss. Slightly off - good, on beat - great. Get enough of a combo going, everything lights up and it feels great.

&gt;When the game is available for purchase, the entire story mode will be in the game. Additionally there will be some post campaign modes (Sandbox type of things) available at launch. There are a couple reasons why we've been considering doing Early Access, but that is mostly related to community feedback and our desire to keep adding fun things. If we just say its a full release it would make more sense to have everyone move onto another project immediately so we do not waste any of our already limited resources.

Outside of these secondhand sources I can find no articles on the first page of google results stating the game will be early access.

"I meant releasing as in releasing as early access. The same type of verbiage they use to garner hype, with no indication of EA in their posts. It's either that or ""Available"" on X date. I forget which one. 

Also yes, I don't hate on Sandbox titles, there's plenty of people who like them. I'm just not very interested in them personally. I can not have interest in something without hating it. It's just not my type of game.

I was under the impression from lack of info, whether the story would be fully available during Dec10 early access. They have said it's finished, but whether it'll be available on EA release?  I couldn't find confirmation on that, so with all that. I wasn't very interested. 

If you say they're giving us the full featured game on early access, why not just make it full release? I just find that odd.  It'll be great, just unusual as most companies don't release into EA with most of the game finished. I just been burned and let down too many times by EA titles.

"While I'm definitely worried for the future of Beat Saber, I think it will be okay. The part about Beat Games never making another game for non-Oculus users is my concern. Unless Beat Games countered that in the contract, I doubt it though. They'd probably have to take less money in that case. For BS I think it'll be more high-profile songs, which means more paid dlc and fewer free songs. I doubt they'll remove custom songs, but I am a bit worried about BeatSaver. I could imagine Facebook rallying artists together for a class action lawsuit or something.   


&gt; Edit: Oh here we go. Downvotes. Typical of this sub. 

I mean, how dare you actually care about non-Oculus consumers here? They didn't pay Facebook, so clearly they're worthless and not worthy of Facebook games.

The example made by u/shortyjacobs where 3DTV is looking at a 3D forest at distance, while VR is standing in the forest, is already a good one. But VR is one step further, you are participating physically in the forest. 50% of the appeal of VR to me are the controllers. And sure there are some fun VR games without controllers (eg, Edge of Nowhere), but overall the physical presence you got is a big selling point. But can you really explain that? Nah.

"Because Quest's hand tracking (not finger tracking, that's another thing) it's meant for Entertainment apps such as Youtube or Netflix, which Rift S does not have at all (like any other PCVR headset). I think they'll implement it sooner or later, but not as fast as for Quest.

Apps for Rift S are not specifically designed for Rift S, but instead, designed for all PCVR. If they'll release hand tracking tomorrow, that feature will take some time to appear on any app, if any app designer chooses to implement it. On the contrary, apps developed for Quest are specifically made for it, and you must be in contact with Oculus in order to make it. I suppose they have been pushing the feature on the major entertainment app on Quest by now.",oculus

Then Rift S, no questions about it.

There is the misconception, online, that Quest can be just as good as Rift S by using link. That's not true. While it can deliver a very good experience, any recent ""cabled HMD"" will do a better job. Thus Quest is perfect for people who need mobility or have a lower-end PC and don't want to risk it. Otherwise, Rift S is the right choice.",oculus
"No clue as of yet, but most likely the finger tracking is an OS feature that they will add to their android base OS on the Quest. This would work because the Quest games run on top of the Quest OS to get the finger tracking data, and also why it would work with the Quest home natively.

But Rift S games run on a PC OS (windows, linux, etc...). They can't do anything about it.

Still, individual developers can still add their own finger tracking solutions to their games with Rift S. So who knows.",oculus

Had a CV1, O+, and upgraded to the S...  Here's some of my text conversation with a friend today:

""On the Rift: Yes, I upgraded to the Rift S and gave my Dad the CV1.  Setup is SO much easier without the sensors, and it's about 2x as sharp as the original Rift...  The headband audio sucks, but I run my Audio Technica ATH M30s over it when racing in VR, I just select soundcard output for sound instead of Rift S sound on the volume icon...  When doing jump around VR, I use a decent pair of in ear headphones plugged into the Rift S itself...  

It's not the 'best', but it's a MASSIVE improvement over the CV1 visually, and I had a Samsung Odyssey+ too...  It beats that in usability, and consistent visuals.  Wider FOV than the Samsung too.

I think the only headset better than the Rift S right now is the Index, but that's $900 for the full kit, compared to $350 right now...

In short...  Despite the audio that you have to work around, I like it a lot, and will stay with the Rift S until something much better below $500 comes out...  FYI, I have a GTX 1080 Ti, and Ryzen 7 2700X...  I stay maxed at 80fps all the time in about anything with a few settings tweaks.""

"&gt;why they can't make it also work for the much faster Displayport connection

Isn't that the exactly reason they can't?

A lower bandwidth connection is significantly easier to send over a wireless connection and the Quest Link is only at like 150Mbps which would be ideal for wireless transmission without much, if any, additional hardware.

The Rift S on the other hand would require a battery, and encoding hardware to turn that displayport signal in to something that can be transmitted wirelessly. They would be two entirely different products with very different requirements.

Not only that but the Quest also has a bit more leniancy for latency because it can locally run ATW and potentially ASW in the future to litigate frame time variances over wireless.",oculus

"Fiber optic (expensive) Long (expensive) and I might be misremembering, but I heard it was C-to-C, not A-to-C (also expensive, moreso than A-to-C cables which reach around 30 bucks just for a 2m cable here in Canada as is. More than double that length would justify the price all on its own to me.)",oculus

No way to simulate it. Even if you turn off atw/asw it would then be running a framerate that does not match the frame rate and would extreme frame tearing. It would be very unpleasant. As far as the change from 90 to 72 it is hardly noticeable. I think the only place I ever notice it is when I am staring at my hand with fast movement.,oculus

"I have both Rift S and Quest.  

First thing first, Oculus announced Oculus Link which turns Quest in to PCVR capable.  You will need the Oculus Link which will run at $70 or so when released later this year(word is, limited run by end of November but we will have to see.)  I say capable because it's not Rift S.  It will be 72hz vs 80hz, compressed image(impressive according to preview but not Rift S level(also LED vs OLED) and more latency(not sure by how much). So Quest will never be Rift S but you have the option to go standalone.  Also, you can lie down to watch Netflix with Quest but not with Rift S.  (I have Oculus Go for that though).  I play Beat saber and Journey of Gods outside on Quest as sun is setting and night using 8 infared led flood light @ amazon for $25 to stay cool while playing.  I'm already making it hard for you, are't I.  Keep reading plz.   The Oculus link supports GTX 1060.

My IPD is 67mm and it's fine for me so you shouldn't have problem with Rift S.

The Rift S is very comfortable and Quest isn't.  The Quest is very front heavy and puts a fair amount of pressure on your face.  I had 50 minute session once and rest were 20-30 minutes due to discomfort.   I think it was Abrash or Carmack who said they would have gone with Halo on Quest if time allotted.  People have tried mods to make Quest more comfortable via HTC Deluxe Audio Strap(was $99 last month, now it's whopping $249) or adding forehead support which made it better(to me, not by that much).

Rift S LED does make a difference in terms of SDE and Resolution but Quest isn't too far off.  I think OLED helps the Quest SDE and Resolution because the vibrant colors slight hides the SDE(easier to digest sort of way for the eyes).  If Quest was 720p ish, Rift S would be 820p ish.  

That is all I can think of right now.  Good luck.",oculus

Your narrative goes like this - I paid thousands of dollars for VR cause I had to have it, but you don't need that for VR. I do, but you don't. VR isn't expensive if the rest of you buy the ones I personally would never buy. I only bought one cause I can't afford spares, but VR is cheap for you.

How does that even make sense? If we don't need all that for VR, why did you feel you needed it? Either VR is expensive, or you got ripped off. Take your pick.

&gt; Somehow you missed the entire point of that comment where I said those things. 

Did I now? Let's look at it.

&gt;I cant believe I have to spend hundreds of dollars to play VR games.  
&gt;  
&gt;Spends literally hundreds of dollars to play other games.

Your original comment was that people spend hundreds of dollars on other games and so spending hundreds on this game is reasonable. You are creating a false sense of equivalence, here because VR is not hundreds of dollars in the same way other games are, but much more expensive than other games are. You personally spent THOUSANDS on just a single seat. What other gaming system have you spent THOUSANDS per seat on? All the other PC VR guys on this thread have also spent THOUSANDS, not hundreds. No other games is the same kind of money per seat.

I picked this comment out of the many because it highlights exactly the problem with the VR market in general. We have all these enthusiasts paying thousands and thousands of dollars for a system that only plays one person at a time, and then they get on threads like this and wonder why it isn't taking off. They imagine problems and boogymen to blame, and imagine some magical savior like Half Life 2 is going to put money in the hands of the unwashed masses so they will buy VR. The price IS the problem, and it always was. People loved the Rift before there was an Index. People loved the Vive before there was a Vive Pro. These improvements, if you want to even call them that, have not expanded what was already a niche market but instead either sold to the same people or cannibalized sales from each other. The answer to the chicken and egg problem is that you will have tons of eggs as soon as you quit charging too much for the chickens. You don't need a superchicken to save you. That's my narrative, and I dare you to try cherry pick it.",oculus
"I wouldn't count on that. They may bundle a three-meter USB 3.0 cable which works with Oculus Link, but the ""official"" five-meter cable is fairly special tech. If they're charging $80 for it separately, it won't be a no-cost pack-in.",oculus

And after dropping $1k on the set, I definitely couldn’t afford a $400+ GPU.

The absolute only reason I upgraded from my CV1 to a Rift S is the inside out tracking. I live in a small townhouse with not enough room for a semi permanent sensor set up.

"Same here. Bought the Quest for PC VR via virtual desktop, and untethered games like Beat Saber.

Upgraded to 2080 Super and high end processor (for upcoming Cyberpunk) and got much better image quality. 

Tested Oculus Link the other day with a good Anker USB cable and the image is perfect. My cable is only 1.5m so waiting for the 5m Oculus since it'll also charge the headset. In the meantime, sideloaded virtual desktop works well.

now that a half-life game got announced what you think?,oculus
"It works, but it doesn't work. I'll give a full explanation.

The Kinect for Xbox One is a surprisingly robust and effective body tracker, if mounted correctly in a large enough room with plenty of space. The correct way to mount it is at about neck or head level with the sensor pointed downwards somewhat - this ensures the the top of the sensor's field of view is a bit above your head, and the bottom of the field of view sees as much of the floor as it can. Too many people make the mistake of pointing the sensor at their head, which means halt the sensor's field of view is just full of the ceiling, and that's pretty useless. You need the wall behind you to always be at least a foot or two behind you. The sensor uses the depth image for body tracking.

For the games that use the Kinect and VR - I don't know of any off the top of my head but I don't keep much track of it - that will give you decent results when using a Rift. There is something better, which is the Azure Kinect sensor, but it only works **with these critical caveats**: 1: you MUST have a Nvidia graphics card, GTX 1060 or better - the body tracking is completely dependent on the hardware on the Nvidia card, and there's no way around it. 2: It's still in development, so it's a bit buggy and constantly changing. 3: it's still in development, so games may not even support it. 4: It's very different from the prior Kinects, so it takes a bit of work for game developers to add support, so be a bit wary of any promises that it will be supported in the future. The Kinect For XBox One is a safer, cheaper, easier option and it's the one I suggest - but I'm throwing up this extra info because you'll probably run into the confusing name ""Azure Kinect"" (or ""Kinect For Azure"" as they sometimes call it) sooner or later, and should avoid it.

For the 'best' body tracking you can get on a consumer system, you'll have the most success with a Vive-compatible system with some extra tracking pucks. However, it's a pain to set those up because you have to play a game of musical chairs when first pairing and un-pairing them. And you need to factor in the cost of straps for them. And each tracking puck has a discrete dongle which requires a USB connection, and there is some confusing information about exactly which kinds of USB ports they work best with (IIRC they work best with USB 2 ports rather than USB 3), and multi-port adapters are discouraged - so you need a desktop with a lot of USB ports overall. I suggest buying sticky labels or a label maker if you get the pucks, so you can number each puck with its paired wireless dongle. That's what I did. To use those pucks, you must have the Vive towers/Lighthouses, they won't work with Oculus ones, so you're looking at 2 towers of $100 each as well as $100 per puck. If you're getting a Vive or Vive-based system (Index/whatever), it's not too bad because you get the towers already, but if you are going the Oculus route that's pretty expensive - and honestly I'd go for the Kinect at that point (check Ebay, you can get ones that are pre-modified specifically for PC use, and it's cheaper). Just keep in mind that the Kinect can only do so much.

Also, the Kinect has software limitations that only 1 Kinect can ever be attached to the computer at one time - you can't double them up for better tracking.  I haven't tried it with the newer Azure Kinect, but I expect that is 1 PC per sensor too. (There are kinda-sorta ways around this, if you are a professional software developer and can spend weeks making custom drivers just to handle the issue.... but then it gets even more complicated.)",oculus

Back in May it was heavily rumoured that this was coming to Quest.

I 100% agree with you on the importance of porting it to Quest to revive the player base. I think there are a few multiplayer games that have faired well under the same conditions (Wands springs to mind). I’m not sure that VR has the overall numbers to support a micro transaction model line you describe, but can’t hurt asking...

As for the possibility of a port or additional content, it’s Oculus’ game, not Insomniac’s. Yes Insomniac developed it, but Oculus paid for it so if they wanted to get another team to port it there shouldn’t be any problems. Just think, Drifter did the port of Robo Recall for Quest, and it was amazing!",oculus

"So... I completely recognize myself in the third character, as I'm sure many old timers do, and I don't think it's 100% our fault. We got onboard with VR with the Rift CV1 (some of us earlier than that) and it was awesome. The subreddit by that time was mostly people being amazed at how good VR was (and some posts about how Palmer Lucky was a terrible human being). We all thought that about 4 years later we'd have something even better.

And I think if some of us are a little better today it's because we invested a lot in the Oculus ecosystem in those four years (about $1200 worth of hardware if you count the $700 headset, $200 touch controllers, extra sensors, PCI-e USB Controller, and hundreds of dollars of games on the Oculus store). So now it's disappointing to see that for the foreseeable feature the only upgrade path is mostly a sidestep (sure Rift-S is more convenient but we've already setup our sensors just fine, the resolution is a bit better but refresh rate and blacks are a little bit worse, and the new touch controllers are not as sturdy) and I personally can't use it because my IPD is too large. This means that the fact that there's no replacement cable is really a bummer for us, and the fact that we can't officially use another headset with all the games we bought on the store over the years.

So yeah, I'm a little grumpy about oculus right now because i'm a bit disappointed in what they have to offer for VR enthusiast who have supported them for years.

Reason why I'm skeptical of my router is I have zero issues playing Skyrim so far with Link connected and with VR performance preset settings at High.

"Image compression already pretty unnoticeable from reports is probably not something that will remain. I mean what's the difference between the cable Oculus develop for Link and the one from Rift S ? Is there any reason for needing to compress the image sent from the computer ?

Frame rate and tracking are meant to stay, though Oculus did say that 90 Hz is technically possible on the Quest though but they needed approval from some regulators (I don't really know why). Hope they get it.

And as far as Oculus efforts in dev seems to be focused, Quest seems to be their flaghsip product now. Oculus Link, hand tracking is only announced on the Quest and general marketing is fully turned towards the Quest (which is apparently very popular). 

I would not be surprised if their next headset is simply the mix of the Quest and Rift S in one device not having that weird choice (I mean only weird because of Link now being there). 

After years of watching the VR field from afar, I'm seriously thinking going in for Black Friday with the Oculus Quest and it's only because of Link really. I have a VR-ready PC (just upgraded it too) so I would always use a device for it but I appreciate the possibility of completely wireless experience on the Quest too (notably for the simple fact that I have larger areas to play in far from my computer)",oculus

"Sone valid points, I’m also planning on getting a quest on Black Friday. 

The compression is subtle and likely to get better over time once it’s out of beta, but rift s still has marginally better clarity. 

It’s unlikely that quest will get 90Hz support, unless it’s through a mod, due to oculus having to go through a certification process again.

"Cobra was used for E:D yes. And its code base is of course still the basis for E:D. So sure, there are things in the E:D code that were developed 20 years ago.  However the cobra engine at the time was not in development specifically for Elite IV. But for the previous Elite games. Elite IV wasn't yet the goal for writing the Cobra code. So that would count towards the development time of those previous games. Now, what we do know is that Elite IV was in development as an MMO from 2000-2001 from Gamespot's interview with Braben.  As far as I am aware that was mostly server work. It is still development work for Elite IV specifically. So it definitely counts. Beyond that I know for a fact that they did work on the Cobra Engine specifically for Elite IV after 2005 onwards. Because that is what Braben told us at the Develop Conference in 2008.

Rift S is definitely clearer. Keep in mind they are not even rendering at full rez of the quest over the link. It has a render target near the original rift I believe. Rift S is also more comfortable for long play and until the actual oculus link cable comes out the current options for the cable are kind of awkward. Even with a 90 degree adapter the cable still hangs off very precariously and I worry about about hitting it during play potentially breaking the port.,oculus

Some kind of cable management system for the rift s is essential IMO as the cable is trash. Not even exaggerating one of the worst cables I've seen on a device this expensive, I was getting spaghetti cable within 5 mins of unboxing the device and even if you do get it stretched out nicely it's really immersion breaking having to untangle yourself every few mins after spinning round a few times. I went for the kiwi pulley system and play sessions are so much better with the cable up in the air out of the way.

3D printed lens protectors if you wear glasses or have friends who will be using the headset to remove risk of glasses scratching the none replaceable rift s lenses.

I'd also recommend replacing the none washable foam on the visor with a third party one especially if you're gonna be passing it between friends.

TBF, the DK1 was an experimental developers kit. It was not intended to be a consumer product (even though many consumers bought it). The whole idea of the DK series was for it to get developer feedback and to be quickly replaced with the next reiteration. 

&gt;Should I wait even longer for another option or will the Rift S future proof me for a long time?

Rift S or Quest (or any VR headset) will be relevant for 2-4 years before the next generation/refresh is released. I'm not sure how long you're expecting from a VR headset",oculus

Well the rift s has only been out for so many months but compatibility wise it’s basically a rift cv1 so devs won’t stop supporting the cv1 anytime soon and that’s 3 or more years old I think?

"So I decided to try and make a better test on this since I'm eagerly waiting for the Rift S facial interface cover VR Cover are making and have said nothing about it yet, ever since the Rift S came out, I've seen very little people talk about this and 1 article mentioning it.

So I decided to try it and noticed how massive the FOV we have hidden away thanks to the original facial interface.

With the FI on, you can see how much I could see on the edges which is represented by the white circle, I took points of reference on all 4 edges to try and create a circle to better illustrate what I'm seeing.

Then I took it off and did the same test again. With it off, as you can see, the increase in FOV is drastic(green circle), to the point where I question what the hell Oculus was thinking, other than being extremely conservative for people who wear glasses. 

In any case,  seeing how as far as I can remember, VR Cover advertised how their cover for the OG rift increase the FOV ever so slightly, I hope that with this one they can manage to trim that interface and give us the nice comfort, as well as a massive FOV increase, maybe not this much, but at least in between the white and green circle in my screenshot.

I would love for this to gain more traction for those of us who don't wear glasses and want the biggest FOV possible, as well as I hope and in my head am sure that VR cover are aware of this, hopefully the facial interface delivers and isn't a let down, or that some other company does it.

"*As someone who played tethered VR for a couple years and then got a Quest, here's are my thoughts:*

I will say that **there are SOME games that are significantly more enjoyable with no wire**.  Stuff that involves fast movement and/or a lot of body movement are much more fun (IMO) on the Quest.  Superhot, Drunken Bar Fight, etc.  You can just spin around, run up to an enemy, suddenly duck or lung in a direction without any worries (as long as you've got a big area, which is easy to find with a standalone headset).

Tea for God on a Quest in a giant open area is one of the highlights of my VR career.  I've never felt more ""lost"" in a virtual space, exploring an impossible maze of hallways that felt huge compared to the 20x20ft garage I was in.

Another advantage was being able to **take my Quest with me when I was travelling for 2 weeks**.  I played Beat Saber on the regular when I was bored in the evenings in a hotel room.

That said, **the vast majority of games either aren't enhanced much by losing the wire, or suffer too much of a visual downgrade to be worth ditching the wire**, and I wouldn't buy a Quest if you're totally okay with doing all your VR next to your PC.  Rift S is going to be more comfortable, better looking, and ultimately a better experience for dedicated PC VR, period.

Quest is a jack of all trades (and only a master of mobile VR because nobody else is doing it yet).  It's a better value as a hybrid headset, but if freedom from wires has little/no value to you, then it's just a decent PC VR headset, comparable to last-(sub)gen headsets like Rift CV1.

If I wasn't expecting a kid soon and starting to think about cutting back on unnecessary spending, I'd probably go for a Quest and Index to, as Rift seems to have less of a future than either of those, but it's still the best PC VR experience you can get for less than 4 figures.",oculus
Refer to this short 4 minute video https://youtu.be/2Ax2Q6zPevo,oculus
"PSVR feels much better, optically, than the Rift S for me.  It doesn't cause me eye strain.  But it also feels much cheaper in the headset area and MUCH lower resolution, compared to either the Quest or the Rift S, and it also somehow feels more ""distant"" from the world?  Also, the PSVR tracking is quite frankly not great.  Do keep in mind I own the gen 1 headset though so I don't know how the newer rev stacks up.

It's pretty amazing PSVR is as good as it is given the hardware for it honestly; there's only one point and dead-reckoning based on a skeleton to track the Move controllers and there's like 10-20 LEDs *per controller* on Quest/Rift S (The controllers are the same on both).  And you don't have to be facing a camera, you can turn at will.  (Especially on Quest native apps where you have no wire)",oculus
"Wow, imagine showing evidence to support yourself instead of being an asshole like other people who replied. Thank you for that, have you personally tried it with beatsaber?",oculus
"The FOV on the Rift S is fine, it's basically the same as the OG Rift, at least for me, the reason for this is how much FOV we have hidden away because of the large facial interface. As for the screendoor effect, the Rift S has basically no Screendoor effect, unless you really, but I mean really want to look for it. On my OG Rift I would get distracted by it as I play, with my Rift S  I just play with no issues.

Tackling the change when I take the facial interface off, the biggest difference aside from the FOV is the fact you basically have edge to edge clarity, like almost perfect, if not perfect edge to edge, I'd have t test again. When the interface is on and you turn your eyes to the edges, it only gets blurry right at the edges, since the sweet spot on the Rift S is massive, but being closer basically eliminates that.

Lastly, the VR Cover comment, I assume you made a typo and meant to say ""VR Cover are NOT doing a full replacement for the Rift S \[...\]""? Because I've tweeted at them several times throughout the months about it and they are working a facial interface replacement, what they released a while ago was just the soft cover, meant for the original facial interface.

"The Rift S is going to be obsolete I think.  The Quest with the link is really great.  I just tried out all my titles and about 90% of them played great.  Only 1 steam early development title was playing laggy.  But all the oculus exclusive stuff was playing great and much better than when I use Quest over the 5ghz wifi.  Excited to get a longer cable and use my Quest a lot more often now.  It also gets far less hot and annoying on the head when using the power from the link rather than the internal hardware.  Another plus.  Quest + Link is really nice choice with the ability to unplug and take it anywhere and still be able to access core apps like Bigscreens, Robo Recall, Pavlov, Media/Tv/Movies etc.  Being able to go into Bigscreens movie theater while laying down in my bed in another room is huge advantage.  Going to be able to take my Quest home for thanksgiving and use it without my PC which is great.  Also the Rift S has one of the worst mics I've ever heard.  I can't believe how bad the Rift S mic is.  And the resolution of the screen is lower than the Quest and is not OLED.  I need OLED for the movies I enjoy.  Nothing like a completely dark theater and those OLED vibrant colors.  Very happy with the direction they are moving with the Quest.  I would consider a Rift S only if the price came way down on it because its just not as versatile as the Quest and always needs power from a super pc with displayport.  Also no manual IPD adjuster on the Rift S....eww Software IPD adjustment so no on the fly adjustment...that is huge deal breaker for me personally.",oculus

"&gt; First of all here is the Guinness Record entry:https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-development-period-for-a-simulation-game

I know of it, but it can't be verified. I'll gladly remind you that Guiness has hundreds of similar unverifiable records - they make for a good point in CVs and you can simply pay for them and somebody will ""just"" check it's not a complete crap, but they usually won't go into technical details for similar claims.

By the way, in a similar way you could claim that Star Citizen's start of development was in early 90s, because that's when Chris Roberts says his ideas originate from.

&gt; The project failed the same year when Braben and Co realized they didn't have the engine and server tech to pull off a massively multiplayer version of Elite they way the wanted it.

So that's already stopped development and you can't really ""connect"" it to the later development, I guess? Or how exactly does this work (my guess: Nobody can define it properly, so the category itself is a nonsense).

One of the quotes from said articles:

&gt; He admitted that the game itself, which he has repeatedly made refernece to in interviews for the past few years, has had a stop-start production as Frontier keeps testing technology and then rejecting it.

This basically means that the start of the development is unknown, because rejecting a tech means you stopped a production.

All in all, I agree that some EIV's parts might have helped in Elite's development, but I would strongly disagree that E:D's development started in 1998.

A final proof that Guinness records are a bunch of nonsense. Why is Elite not listed here? https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-protracted-game-development/#:~:targetText=Officially%20announced%20on%2028%20April,game%20engine%20and%20other%20issues%22. , when according to your record it took longer than DNF? :)",oculus

It is harder to wait for them to make the Rift S interface because of how bad the FOV is with the stock one,oculus

"I was in the same position: I love VR, but I couldn't convince myself to get a gaming pc+pc vr headset. So when I heard about Oculus working on Quest(Santa Cruz back then), I got curious of it as a proof of concept(wireless vr with a mobile chip rendering pretty demanding vr content at a high framerate sounded like a quite a challenge), because I was convinced if they manage to pull it off it probably gonna cost 500+ bucks. When they announced it is gonna be 399, I couldn't resist it anymore and jumped on the bandwagon. 

So if you don't have a PC, it is pretty much a no brainer: amount and quality of content is more than convincing to get it. I personally enjoy playing Thrill of Fight, Beat Saber, Tilt Brush and Racket Fury. I do envy people playing Stormland or Asgard's Wrath and now upcoming Half Life game, but Quest is amazing and I have no regrets getting it.

Regarding purchases of games, I would suggest not to go crazy and start with free demos first and see if those games actually up to your taste(that's how I got hooked on Beat Saber). I personally chose games that offer decent replay-ability as story based games on VR at the moment are way too short to justify the cost.",oculus
"&gt; No, I remember it because they marketed the hell out of the new h.264 encoder.  

Yes, because Twitch and others do not support h265 :) That's why the marketing was concentrated on h264. It doesn't mean the improvements are only on the h264 side. And they weren't. Anyway look for example here:

&gt; Turing GPUs also ship with an enhanced NVENC encoder unit that adds support for H.265 (HEVC) 8K encode at 30 fps. The new NVENC encoder provides up to 25% bitrate savings for HEVC and up to 15% bitrate savings for H.264. Turing’s new NVDEC decoder has been updated to support decoding of HEVC 4:4:4  8/10/12-bit video streams, and it also supports VP9 10/12-bit HDR similar to Pascal GP102/107/108 and Volta GV100 GPUs.

So if you ask if we should ""stop making movies because blind people can't watch them"", you create a strawman.  
When it comes to video games, it's not that we'd need to ""not make a VR game at all"", but it would be much easier to make a VR and a non VR version of a game than to make a movie for blind people, don't you think?

"&gt;Between 2005-2008 Frontier built the engine and tech that would ultimately power Elite Dangerous. That is when I heard Braben give a talk about it at a Develop Conference (Jul 30th 2008).

Why did you ignore this. This is Braben clearly saying the nearly finished the tech for Elite in 2008 at a conference. Full six years before the game released.  I know this to be true, because I was there. Spoke with him. That is why I am even aware of this conference in the first place.  Look at the Elite Dangerous wiki page. How was there info on it from 2005-2012 if the game supposedly only started development in 2012. This revisionist history crap you are doing is bullshit.

"Well there are also comfort options for people in Vr games, like teleportation. Half life will have this as an option as well, even if I will play the game with full free movement, other have options. 


A game developed from ground up with Vr in mind is not really possible to be played on a monitor with mouse and keyboard. Watch the trailer again and think about how you want perform all those actions with kb/m. Like searching in a board for bullets. 

In Vr you can move your Head and both your hands completly individually. It controls just like in real life.

So while it may be possible to script all VR events to buttons and animate them, it would take away a lot from the game. It is to expected that half life Alyx without Vr would just be mediocre at best. Why do people want to sell them a mediocre game at full price? It would hurt the brand half life.

"I own both and I definitely prefer Rift S for most cases. Quest is much softer and there is some (albeit very slight) latency difference that is enough for me to notice. Also, coming from video production, Im allergic to visual artifacts and most of the time I dont notice them with link, however in high contrast scenes (title screen of Edge of Tomorrow for example) I see banding from compression. Also it seems that its taking more power from my PC to run link than native Rift S even though fps is lower and effective rener resolution is supposedly the same. Stormland for example works fine on Rift S but there is heavy latency with Link. And the more power game needs, more latency I notice. Beat Saber is flawless but dont really see the point in doing that since Quest version is awesome. But its definitely the absolute best way to play Edge of Tomorrow.

Conculsion for me - if you only get one HMD, get a Quest just because of the value. But if you can have both, Rift S is far superior for PCVR, at least for now. The only 2 reasons to use Link in that case would be blacks and IPD adjustment.",oculus

"I've checked it out in DeoVR on the Go and the benefits seem dubious to me. The default highest quality the app chooses to play is the 2160p h264 version which seems high enough for 3D 180 content. When switching to Viewpoert the two main differences I noticed were the gamma and proper playback. The viewport seems brighter and it seems to have proper 60fps playback. Image quality in itself is not better than the 2160p clips if you disregard the whole ""brighter seems better"" trap, the biggest issue seems that when playing the h264 60FPS labeled clips the playback is choppy. Now I wasn't going to hunt down the original clips from the publishers and do some extensive detective work to see if the clips are actually 60FPS, but it's a bit of a hit and miss with DeoVR (well, SLR really) due to them transcoding the 30FPS clips to 60FPS versions as well. Regardless of that though, the non-viewport playback seems choppy for both 60FPS and 30FPS clips which is weird. Viewport playback looks like what you would expect from a proper 60FPS video.",oculus

"Quest has a  slightly higher resolution on paper but necause it is Pentile OLED compared to Rift S RGB Stripe, the Rift S actually has 30% more sub-pixels meaning the SDE is lower on Rift S than Quest. ie Image is sharper n Rift S and text is easier to read. 

Then add the fact that PCVR over Quest Link compressess and subsamples the output res from the PC and you end up with a softer image on the Quest than the Rift S even if the Quest used RGB Stripe LCD like the Rift S which it doesnt.

If PCVR is your primary VR thing, then you didnt make a mistake at all.

"While Oculus games work fine with Link for me, starting Steam VR games was very hit and miss, but this might get fixed as time moves on and Link moves out of Beta. With the Rift S SteamVR stuff worked flawlessly and looked great, but with Link there's a certain amount of lag and some games get severe performance issues. I've also run into in issue where the games keep thinking that the grab buttons or triggers a constantly held down, making it unable to open a fist, let go or grab something in some games, it's quite odd. In Compound my fists wouldn't open, in Blade &amp; Sorcery letting go of stuff was veeery finicky. In H3VR physics seemed to happen in slow motion (and not in a good way).  


The Quest is a steal for 200 nonetheless, there are lots of great experiences on it. PCVR can be impressive through Link, but the warping and slight compression blur is something I notice a lot - Rift S is smoother, more responsive with better tracking and looks better, too, also it works with pretty much anything without issues, since it's native PCVR. If the option of taking the Quest on the go is enticing to you I'd use that, but if you're here for that PCVR goodness, everything is better on Rift S... but you're always tethered and there's no hardware IPD-adjustment.",oculus

"&gt; All in all, I agree that some EIV's parts might have helped in Elite's development, but I would strongly disagree that E:D's development started in 1998.

Why did you ignore this? ;)

Look, I don't deny there was **some** reuse of work. But that's what I say towards the end as well - is Doom the longest game in development, because John Romero released Sigil in 2019? Is Elite the longest game in development ever, because it still uses some concepts from the original Elite (like procedural generation)? Is DNF not the longest game in development, because at some point it was sold to other company, thus breaking the development and basically restarting with some assets? If Elite IV was supposed to be single player, did E:D's development start only when the goal changed to pure always-online or not (as you could argue those two concepts lead to completely different games)? And so on, and so on.

Nobody specifies these categories and it's unclear what ""in development"" actually means, unlike stuff like ""highest jump"" or ""the most balloons popped in one minute"" (though to be honest, some of these categories have similar pitfalls and need lots of further specifications). If I write one line of Tic-Tac-Toes today and then finish the code in 50 years, will I qualify for a Guinness record? What if I say the first line was written by my dead father 50 years ago and I finished the development (writing in BASIC, of course), who will check for that?",oculus

"I feel that the situation will be different with half life: alyx. Proper vr development takes skill as we've seen, and having all those tools at your disposal will get a lot of people making mods. It'll probably die down after a while when unreal and unity get used for vr more as people learn how to make vr games.",oculus
"I somewhat disagree. If Facebook pulled out of VR right now, than sure, VR would be in a bad place, since they own Oculus. However a whole lot of VRs problems only started once Facebook jumped in. Back when Oculus was on it's own, they had no problem delivering a $300 headset. But once a lot of money entered the game, expectations exploded and so did the headset prices, which in turn killed all the VR hype that was build around a $300 headset. And that in turn made a lot of developers jump ship. On top of that Facebook fractured the market with exclusives and Facebook being Facebook really didn't help the image of VR either.

Without Facebook, VR would have had the chance of a much more natural growth, driving by supply and demand. All those indie games that don't sell, would have a easier time selling copies if they wouldn't need to compete with Facebook funded games.

The problem with Facebook being around is simply is that now every small fish has to compete with Facebook, and most simply can't, so they don't even bother. Facebook is essentially the solution to a problem that they created themselves.",oculus

"I would suggest to check your cpu temperatures during VR gaming. I have a laptop with an i7 8750h and a GTX 1060, and I would always have thermal throttling issues while playing in VR. The 8750h is a 6 cores CPU which is relatively new for laptops and runs pretty hot so it's hard to use it's full potential without thermal or power throttling. Getting a cooling pad and undervolting the cpu are the main ways to avoid thermal throttling, and it's the only way I could get a smooth experience in VR. As for Blade &amp; Sorcery, I also have the same issue where FPS drops to 40 (even with everything set to low). Only thing I found was to disable ASW with Oculus Tray Tool, that way the framerate dips only to 65-70fps, which is already way more playable. Hope this helps!",oculus

"Not exactly. He's saying that a lot of indie sprung up who's business model is not to make a game that sells, but to score funding tom me a/some game without the risk and pressure of financial failure.

He acknowledges this in the next paragraph:

As opposed to, let's lock down the content behind this wall and block out 70-80% of the marketplace. We just didn't feel that made sense for this early market space that we're in. And it doesn't make sense for developers because it doesn't give them a path to long-term success. So developers definitely appreciated that.""

&gt;When asked directly about the big sums that Oculus has used to fuel VR development, Breton continues, ""I actually don't think [their investment approach] is great for the market because... what they are actually doing is getting developers to trade long-term success for short-term cash. And so they are teaching the developers that essentially we can give you this grant for X millions of dollars but your content is not likely going to match the market that it's going to come into. And especially if it's locked down to a platform that has a very small percentage of the overall market.

&gt;""So this is not doing the developers a service in my view; in a sense it's trading some short term cash to maybe get them through this year but the folks that are working from the ground up and trying to match the development size and scope with where the market's at today, they are actually setting themselves up to be long-term businesses. That's who we want to work with.""

https://www.vrandfun.com/htc-vive-joel-breton-disapproves-oculus-business-strategies/

&gt;Breton also provided his two cents about Oculus and its business strategies. “Oculus, I think they’re doing good work for the overall ecosystem in some areas. I disagree with their strategy a lot.” What the Vice President of Global VR Content at HTC Vive is referring to here is Oculus’s exclusive content business strategy. “I just feel that they’re essentially hampering developers’ ability to create large communities by blocking them out from other platforms.”

&gt;Oculus believes that without their funding, some of these exclusive games would’ve never seen the light of day and never even exist in the first place. Breton finds this problematic for the “developer’s long-term success.” This is due to the fact studios are receiving large fundings for big exclusive games but when they try to develop a game of their own, they won’t be able to “develop at the size and scope that the market is at.” Breton believes this business strategy might be setting studios up for failure down the road.",oculus

"Since when is concepting and pre-production no longer part of the development process. When Braben announced the game they certainly did pre-production. There is no way they announced the game at E3 in 1998 and then did nothing for three years.  
Well, fact is we know the game was in active engine development as an MMO, not as a single player game from 2000-2001. Braben has said as much in a Gamespot interview back then. That was always the point of Elite IV. They couldn't make it work, so they stopped and put it on ice. But it is active development time for the same game.  

Could you imagine if CIG did this with Star Citizen ? Stop development for a year and say hey this isn't working. We are taking a break and starting over.  People would count that as development time as well.  I am not saying that Elite is the longest game that has ever been in development but it is certainly in the top 5. And as far as simulation games goes there is nothing that took this long to make.  Regardless of whether you want to count the entire period or not. Who checks this ? Well Braben gave interviews and talks about it during this period. So we know it from the horse's mouth that they were doing this work. So, whether or not you want to believe in the Guinness entry for which Braben has a certificate in his office or not, at the very least, the same game was in development, specifically engine, tools and network architecture development by more or less the same team from 2000-2001 / 2005-2010 and from 2011-2014. Granted they did have some significant personal turn over in 2010. However, at the very minimum that is 9 years of documented development, with an uncertainty period after E3 and 4 years were most of their attention was on ""The Outsider"". 
If your point of contention is the actual Guinness book entry, then fine, ignore the entry. But the fact remains Elite IV is the simulation game with the longest development. They didn't just make a few assets and it wasn't just SOME development in those mid 2000s they build the whole Cobra engine. The engine, the tools, the network architecture those are the bulk of the development of a game like this. Especially, considering how much of this game is procedural.  That technology is still the basis Elite is being built upon today.  

See personally, I don't mind to wait for a good game like that for this long. Elite is quite the achievement and as such I hate to dismiss all the work that the team put into it over the years. When people say the game was made in between 2012 and 2014 then it just diminishes the effort put into it.",oculus

"While I'm not wheelchair-bound, I play VR in a chair. (Mostly because I don't have enough room to move around, but it also helps lock me in place and makes it *physically impossible* for me to overstep my boundaries, so I can flail around without worry.)

And honestly? *Most* VR games work very well even with this. The only game I've had issue with so far is QuiVr, which had things I needed to interact with be physically outside of my boundary, so I couldn't actually use the menus. Most games allow you to grab objects and interact with things from a distance so that you don't have to physically move yourself.

However, one issue I do see is grabbing objects. Good games typically allow you to grab objects from a distance, zipping them to your hand. (I've seen no game do this as well as Rec Room, but I've noticed it's also present in the Boneworks and HL:Alyx trailers) Unfortunately, some games require your hand to physically overlap an object in order to grab them, which would probably make grabbing items on the floor impossible. (The only two games I can think of which this would be an issue is Job Simulator and A Township Tale. I'd imagine Vacation Simulator too, but I haven't played it yet.)

So, for ""games that are simple and enjoyable for people in a chair""... that basically just boils down to ""games that are simple and enjoyable"". Unfortunately, the only ""simple"" games I can think of are The Lab, Beat Saber, Waltz of the Wizard and Rec Room. However, I know The Lab is Steam-exclusive and Rec Room has limited features on Quest. Waltz of the Wizard is said to be *coming* to Quest, but hasn't released yet.

I'd say it's very soft. With AL-VR's higher resolution you can get a picture that looks a lot sharper than link (it chokes the encoder though, it's unplayable)

Just staring at the tree of the SteamVR home environment looks very soft in comparison to what AL-VR can do.

If we were able to harness the full sharpness of the Quest's displays, the image would look almost as sharp as the one on a Rift S (but the compression would still make sure it looked worse, no matter what)

"Quest has Beat Saber and Superhot. If you get a working USB-C to USB-A cable, you can play SteamVR games on the Quest at a lower refresh rate compared to the Rift S (72hz on the Quest vs 80hz on the Rift S), a reduced resolution (Supposedly comparable to a CV1. Even if it gets improved though, artifacting is going to happen and since it is an OLED display, it will not look as sharp as a LCD panel, which the Rift S has), and- subjectively- reduced comfort. However, you gain a VR HMD that can work as a standalone device or as a PCVR HMD.

If you like wireless and the ability to play anywhere, the Quest is going to be what you want. If you care about the PC more, get the Rift S. Just be sure that your PC is good enough for VR if you plan to do PCVR in any capacity and in the case of the Quest, the Link feature doesn't officially support every GPU out there.

Anyways, here's some game recommendations for PCVR (I haven't played the current major Oculus titles because I personally really don't have much interest in them):

* (FREE) The Lab if this is your first VR device, or showcasing it to other people.
* (FREE) Google Earth VR if you want to check out your home and other areas in VR.
* (FREE) Aircar if you want to showcase VR to other people.
* Blade &amp; Sorcery if you want a sword-fighting physics sandbox. Mod this game with mods off of Nexus like Outer Rim, KatanaPack, etc.
* Pavlov if you want something akin to CSGO in VR with workshop maps that have gamemodes like TTT, zombies, etc.
* Skyrim VR if you just want Skyrim in VR. Mod this game with the guides on r/skyrimvr too.
* Arizona Sunshine, loading times are not too good for me though.
* Climbey for a neat climbing game.
* The Forest if you want a survival horror game.
* Payday 2 VR if you like Payday 2. It's free DLC for Payday 2.
* Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades, a fun gun-simulator sandbox. It has weapons and a map from TF2 as well.
* Space Engine if you want to explore space.
* Thief Simulator VR if you want a both polished and janky, well, thief simulator.
* Tabletop Simulator if you like playing card or board games with friends.
* Star Trek Bridge Crew if you want to work with a crew of people to operate a spaceship.
* Thumper if you want a rhythm game.
* Until You Fall, a fun rogue-like sword-fighting game.
* I Expect You to Die, a fun seated puzzle game.
* L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files if you like the original game...or just want a detective game. Word of warning, this is not the full game in VR, only some of the cases.
* Gorn if you want a more unrealistic sword-fighting game.
* Dolphin VR to play some old Wii, GameCube, and some N64 games in VR. Mileage may vary from game to game.
* Vivecraft if you have Minecraft Java Edition.
* (QUEST/PC) Next year, the beta for a Half-Life 1 VR mod will come out. While there is a mod right now, the dev is gonna be working on a better version. HOWEVER, Quest has HL1VR in the form of Lambda1VR.
* VorpX for playing older games, mileage WILL vary from game to game, lots of tinkering is involved. I would only get this if you have $40 that you wouldn't mind losing, if you are willing to tinker with settings, and if you really want to play older games like Fallout New Vegas in VR.

Did I get most of them?",oculus
"Hullo!

I didn't order any protective thing for the cable. But I got my replacement Rift S a couple weeks ago, and it had the newer cable!

Everything has been great so far. Zero issues. I've also done some roomscale stuff with lots of turning. Not a single issue with static in the headset or black screen or anything like that, and the cable is so much better and more flexible.

Whether or not the only issue with my previous headset was the cable (I think there was more than that, because I had a couple other more minor issues too that are now gone as well), the new cable is absolutely much better.",oculus

"Nope. They made it clear that because it requires so much developer support to work, they consider a braking change that should only happen when they are releasing a new generation of VR where it comes as the standard contolller.

Developer do not want to tack on support for controllers that only a small percentage of players have.",oculus
"PokerStars VR, though only if you can set the second controller in front of you. On your off hand(settings selectable L or R) you have a wristwatch you tap to open the navigation menu for tables, store items, etc...  
gameplay wise the only difficulty I can think of is if YOU try to raise all in, your case you would need to stack chips on the bet line pretty fast, otherwise, you can call an all in bet with a single token displayed in front of you.

Fun game if you like poker, lots of silly props to buy and use at the table.",oculus
Thanks! Do you think it will be good enough to run the high end games for a few years hopefully? And hopefully upgraded headsets?,oculus
No doubt in my mind that I'll be buying this on release day. I've been waiting for a new great VR game for awhile!,oculus

"While I'm 1000% in favor of this, we've literally been asking for it for years at this point.  I remember voting on one of these uservoice things 1.5-2 years ago for this feature.

Then I poked around the oculus app/site and couldn't find the option there, then google.

Ultimately I ended up just sending her some money via Google pay, and told her to buy the star wars games. Then I upvoted all gift card and gifting threads I found.",oculus

"That simply isn't true. There are INCREDIBLE MP VR games, but only stuff like Pavlov and Rec Room has people playing it. 

Off the top of my head, Sprint Vector and Creed are super awesome but impossible to find a match. Honestly Sprint Vector is one of the best VR MP games ever made but it's a chicken and egg situation where they see no one is playing it so they don't play it...

I'm looking at the current status right now and there are plenty of good VR MP games with less than 5 daily players.",oculus

I work with unity as well and removing real-time shadows for baked shadows really gave us the performance boost we needed. We run a program along side the vr that takes up 60% of the cpu so every bit counts. Real-time shadows are performance breakers in vr,oculus
"While VR has ruined *most* flat gaming for me, I'm still looking forward to Ori and the Will of the Wisps.  But even for ""pancake"" games, I do still prefer at least stereoscopic 3D when possible (e.g. via TriDef).  The Rayman Origins and Legends games for example, while consisting of non-polygon graphic for the most part, are so layered and with frequent scaling and movement into and out of the screen that they both work superbly in stereoscopic 3D.  I'm told the first Ori game is stunning in stereoscopic as well but the only way I'm aware of to play that one in 3D is via VorpX, which I don't have.


Trine 4 on the other hand, despite also having very pretty graphics, just hasn't captured my interest.  The first three had such great stereoscopy that all I can think about is how much better it would be in 3D.  But VR exceeds even that stuff for me in general.  It's the difference between seeing the game world on a screen to being transported *into* that world.  It's almost magical.",oculus

"Fine is different than being the bottleneck though when you're shooting for 90/120/144 in VR though. And with the upward trend in cores and threads, we'll see more of an upward trend of games using them. There are already a bunch of games that use 6+, a lot not super effectively, but they still use them and that number increases constantly. That and, with VR being the main point here from OP, it's an evolving and rapidly expanding group that should see more benefit from higher cores over pancake in the likely very near future.

I'm not saying 'lmao go upgrade your shit scrub' I'm just pointing out that at a 2012 CPU an upgrade would not only be well deserved and decently cheap, but noticable, especially with a game where it's main focus is the physics and doing rifle kickflips.",oculus

"Been going back and forth between headsets, but seeing the PC specs you have, I would opt for the Rift S. I love the Quest's portability, and the link makes it quite the amazing hybrid system,  but I find myself using it only for short, 20 minute bursts with its native games like Beat Saber, or  Vader Immortal.

Since I like playing the large scrope games like Asgard's Wrath, and my most recent purchase, No Man's Sky, I prefer the best fidelity, performance and comfortably. There is no way I'm using my Quest with link for those, if I have a Rift S sitting 2 feet away. If I didn't have the S, than it would be a whole different story.

Besides the huge comfort factor difference (for me), the Rift S screen is has got me hooked. I  had the original Rift (sold it). The Quest screen door effect is definitely an improvement over the Rift, but the Rift S has virtually no screen door effect, resulting in a crisper display. 

The Quest's screen is also pretty damn sweet, but that's without the link. With it, colors and detail are a bit softer/muted and there is moments of latency here and there, depending on the game. For a beta release though, I'm floored. 

Without link, the sense of freedom on the Quest is one of its best features, and for many people, that outweighs everything and I can understand that. I mean, you can't beat walking into a different room, setting up a guardian which takes all of like 15 seconds, and off you go, but again, for me, I overall, prefer the Rift S.",oculus
"I'm not saying it's perfect, you of course need to evaluate what is bottlenecking in your system and what your goals are. Generally speaking, a AAA-type game will bottleneck your 2 year old GPU before it bottlenecks your 5 year old CPU, so it is generally better to maximize GPU.",oculus
Ah look at that. Didn't even know that. Only flown it once in a simulator and it handles... Interestingly.,oculus

"Absolutely. We're saying the same thing really for most cases. Specifically we're talking about a VR game that is being sold essentially as a pure physics playground though.

I'd be a lot more concerned about an FX chip than a 1080.",oculus

"Actually, it does make sense.  Companies send out review samples to get their product exposure.  A reviewer accepts review samples and gives their expert opinion in the hope that people notice them and support the site.  

It depends on the integrity of the company of the company that sends the product as well as the integrity of the reviewer that builds trust with their audience.

What PC/laptop/accessory set do you recommend to run this guys?,oculus
"1- No, the image clarity on quest is clearly inferior. Rift S has literally 50% more subpixel than Quest. The Quest's resolution increase is merely an attempt to fix the issues related to a Pentile stripe, which is known, objectively recognized, and generally shun upon. Have you ever wondered why Index has an LCD panel and not an OLED one? It's really hard to deny it, unless you never tried both, which is the feeling that i get from your posts.

This open the door to more issues related to the OLED monitor, such as the wake-up time of the pixels being too slow turn-off were enabled, creating the black smear phenomenon. Thus, this feature is disabled. But disabling it often causes the infamous red-dust or green-dust issue, and then you still have a contaminated image.

3 - You literally cannot achieve a decent framerate or resolution without image compression, with Quest. This is a hardware issue, and thus, unfixable. Rift S (or any other cabled HMD) does not risk visual artifacts, as Quest does (and will always do)

Really, it's ok if you like most Quest. It's a great machine. But I wouldn't allow my personal preference to blind me to the point of calling the other device ""redundant"" based only on rumors or lack of testing.",oculus

"Unfortunately the grip button is pretty vital to almost every game. There are also lots of situations where you need to hold that button of extended periods of time.
Would it enable you to press the grip button if you didn’t have to physically support the controller ? As the other comment or said, there are accessories that strap the controller to your hands so that you don’t have to support it.

If that doesn’t work, any chance you have access to a 3D printer, if you post in r/oculus, or maybe r/engineering or maybe even r/engineeringstudents

"Fwiw I'm finally pretty happy with the pimax after I dialed stuff in. Most of my pains were just not knowing for example that I needed the new beta version of their software to use the index controllers, which wasn't widely made clear, but it seems to work as well as a vive for the most part in terms of running OK with most major games.  But I will grant it isn't perfect and there are some trade offs with the pimax.  Software is still a work in progress, mainly.  But it's gotten a lot better already and they open sourced it recently too.

All in all, I wouldn't trade my pimax for another headset at the present time.  But I do keep my vive wands on hand due to unsatisfactory backwards compatibility of the index controllers.  They're amazing but some games are just simpler to stick with the wands.  Half Life should be fucking wicked though.",oculus

"Get the Quest now and have some fun with it. When you upgrade your PC, you can use your Quest with it using the Link functionality, or switch to another headset like the Index.

One thing to mention is that a lot of the Quest games (not all, but many) have crossbuy with the PC version. So you can buy the Quest versions and then access the Rift versions on PC (you can use Revive if you want to play them on a non-Oculus HMD).",oculus
"That isn't the point at all though. You would never ever sell any hardware based on, ""yeah there are 500 MP games but only 10 of them are active"" because you are really saying, ""there are 10 MP games"". If the player base isn't active the game basically doesn't exist. 

Even VR MP games from AAA studios don't have enough players to start a match. I am speaking mostly to the Ubisoft (and I guess Survios?) games. I only bring up Survios bc it seems like they make high quality MP games that no one plays. (Raw Data, Sprint Vector, Creed and Battlewake.)

"I quite like my S, just played Beat Saber a few hours ago and it's just as good as ever.

I will suggest some good quality rechargable AA batteries(and a charger) for the controllers though, as they can eat up batteries pretty quick(I tend to replace mine with freshly charged ones every few sessions when it warns me they're low). One AA per controller, at least 4 so you have a charged pair to replace them with. I had some already so it worked out perfectly.",oculus

"Oh, no, as I said, you do sound ready for building your own PC.
Yes, definitely, you will see your GTX 1060 utilized to its full. Now you are severely bottlenecked.

Heck, even older Intel i5s are not sufficient for high framerates https://youtu.be/s42gvVS77dU

And a modern Ryzen is faster with a GTX 1060 even than old i5s. So imagine how your A10 bottlenecks you.

And in VR you actually render 2 times at 90hz. Even 120hz eith an Index.

The motherboard I linked is really cheap and might actually need a BIOS update with the latest Ryzen processors. But it will get you good VR performance amd will allow you to upgrade.

"That's Qualcomm withholding access to some low level parts of the silicon, which Oculus need to implement those protocols. If they can sweet talk (ie pay) them well enough, maybe they'll eventually relent. Oculus no doubt want this to be a launch feature for Quest 2, so they're probably pushing pretty hard to get this sorted now so it's ready by then.",oculus
What I've heard (see also: rumor) is that it starts to look nicer and nicer/more coherent as you start to get further in the game ie: as you start to leave the in-world VR,oculus
Just like they were considering another batch of CV1 replacement cables?,oculus
"You'll see a couple people show up and claim those things.

They're the haters who likely have never even tried VR, or only bought the most expensive headset and deign the S beneath them. I've had mine for months, beat saber is my shit and it's nothing like they claim. You don't have to buy a single thing from the oculus store(the Rift S can play your steam VR games, though the ones that work with the SDK are the best experience) and the visual quality is phenomenal, especially compared with all the previous headsets.

It may not be perfect, but for the price it's the best option for sure. If you want to spent 2.5x the price for the index you can do better. Or maybe whatever you have to pay for a pimax might work out, idek.",oculus

"All looks good. The only concern for me is the AI. I did not see the enemies pushing you. For example: the part wjere you are behind the door and 2 enemies just wait for you to pop out. They have more numbers, so, instead of waiting for you to shoot them with blind fire, they should have lobbed a grenade and bumrushed you.

I think that's where HLA will deliver: enemy AI.",oculus

"Take it with a grain of salt because I haven't done this myself. I've just seen lots of people in various threads talking about mixing and matching controllers and headsets using steamVR.  
Your Rift would still need to use its own tracking system so this new setup wouldn't let you have much bigger space, only an extra arm's length I guess.  
For your situation, I guess you might be able to get some of the gen 1 Vive lighthouses for cheap somewhere. These also have some size limitation, but are better than the CV1 cameras. Otherwise the new lighthouses are $150 each so for 2 of those and the controllers you're looking at $580.",oculus
Quest is a great device. Untethered VR is a wonderful thing.,oculus
Also this setup wouldn't work for stuff you buy through the Oculus store unless you use something like Revive.,oculus
"I need to try ALVR at some point. 

It would be nice to see some improvement, I just don't have faith they'll carry on with it. I personally think we're kind of gimped by the lack of power on the Quest. 

I hope I'm wrong and the additional 8hz of framerate data saved by using the Quest can be used to process and refine the image further for the Quest.",oculus

"That makes sense; The Vive's sensors are all on the front part of the headset (The little dimples all over it), so if your desk is against the wall, you're basically covering up 90% of the sensors when sitting at it. Putting one of the base stations on your desk where it can see the HMD would help immensely. (Also, glass isn't too bad for Base Station tracking; It's mirrors that REALLY mess it up).",oculus
I absolutely love this video and it had a huge impact on me when it came out...but I disagree with your title whole heartedly.,oculus

1. It's a technical feat. They are trying to push boundaries in how things are built. I don't remember exact things that they did but one of them had to do with clouds. They're trying to create the best possible ""game"" by being pioneers in the industry; the first to forge new methods of doing things.

"My only other option is buying the original Vive because of the price point, would you recommend that? I think it is getting too old at this point and I don't like setting up external sensors.",oculus
"Yes. It doesn't work in the Quest default browser but loads in Firefox on Quest, and on my phone. Hosted on my PC.",oculus
"I'm 69 and it's challenging to see clearly easily. but it can be done. You just won't see clearly in both eyes at the same time. You may have to adjust your headset a lot depending on what you want to see clearly. That may not matter that much in games but if you're trying to read text or menus, you won't do that as easily as if you wore a headset like the Quest which has an adjustable IPD control. 

I also don't know if a 70 IPD is exponentially worse than a 69 IPD. I assume that it's worse though. I bought the Quest too but I mostly wear the Rift S because it's more comfortable. In doing that, I sacrifice clarity of vision. My theory, which could be wrong is that, maybe you could get an idea of what the Rift S might look like if you wear a headset that has no IPD control. That might be a $13 Walmart Cardboard headset that uses a phone. You shouldn't see clearly in that either since it probably has no IPD control. The Oculus Go has no IPD control so if you know someone who has a GO, put it on and try to read the Home screen menu items. You'll see the problem because of your IPD. 

Bottom line. I can make it work with a 69 IPD because I've lived with the problem going back to the Gear VR days. But I guess that with a 70 IPD, your problem may be worse. And I think there may be a point, perhaps in the 70s, where a headset may be unusual -- such as if IPD was 75, 76, etc. Or maybe 72 might do it. I don't know. I only know 69. 

Answer - You will encounter problems as in .. you won't see as clearly in both eyes at once as someone who has an IPD within the range that the Rift S supports.",oculus
"No, I wouldn't recommend that.

Oculus Quest and Samsung Odyssey+ are also options.",oculus
"I am sorry. You do realize Elite Dangerous literally won a Guiness book entry for the longest development time of a simulation game, right ? You realize they just rebranded the name of the game for the Kickstarter and renamed it from Elite IV to Elite Dangerous so people would realize how long the development was.  I mean I love Elite, but let’s not rewrite history here.  I remember how painful it was to wait for that game.",oculus
"Thanks for your feedback! I'm thinking I may be able to tolerate it while playing because I won't focus about the exact details that much in action but that is just a guess. It is going to be my first VR experience. I read that it has IPD adjustments in software, do they not work?",oculus
Yeah this game is a disaster. I played the first few missions and I think sadly I’m past my refund period. The idea is cool but this execution is really lacking in many areas. My pop’s was interested and I told him run for the hills on this one and don’t look back. Even if you don’t try and view this as a AAA title and temper your expectations it just comes up disappointed. For instance you can punch someone to knock them out barefisted but for some reason if I have a pistol and try to pistol whip someone while sneaking upon them it doesn’t even register properly. Visually it’s barely passable as well and the weapon feedback is poor. I should have stayed away when they delayed it back in September.,oculus
"He means ""lower prices in the 3rd world countries"", not just local currency support.",oculus
I never said there was no development pre Kickstarter campaign. I remember following alt.fan.elite for any news on the sequel years and years earlier. All I meant was that there was a full release a reasonable time after asking for backers’ money.,oculus
"If you don’t mind the worse tracking for military style shooters like Onward or Pavlov... I gave back my Quest because it could do so little in terms of tracking, compared to my trusty CV1.",oculus
"It was launched before the Rift S, so it might run the original Rift but not the S as their connections are different. But yeah, sorry for asking...",oculus
Yes ok. This I agree with.,oculus
"Summary for those who dont want to watch the video.

As im sure alot of you are already aware Boneworks is coming on December the 10th and seems to be a game that people either think is the second coming of christ or just a tech demo.

I sit somewhere in the middle, I can see alot of good things with this game its doing differently and also have some concerns and in this video I am going to go over the reasons why I think people are so hyped for this game and add my concerns at the end.

**Inverse Kinematics** \- The first thing this is doing well is the Inverse Kinematics, Inverse Kinematics arent new, We are seeing more and more games ditch the floating hands and give you a full body in VR with mixed results. Boneworks seems to be one of the best I have seen. You can see in the video the way the wrist and hand position seems perfect.

(I explain what Inverse Kinematics is in the video but wont go into it here as im sure most know what it is)

Having an in game body rather than floating hands can really add to the immersion, as long as it isnt completely off compared to our real world body.

**Full Physics Body** \- Not only is the body visible in VR in boneworks but its actually a full physics body. This means your body, not just your hands or head can interact and influence the enviroment. (I show some examples of this in the video) In the past we have seen games rely on you having to use your hands to open doors or even only being able to open a door on a single contact point like the door handle.

Having a full body will make moving and interacting with the enviroment more natural and we have already seen this with Blade and Sorcery but you can still ghost objects through your body and arms which isnt possible in Boneworks (again I show examples of this in the video) 

**Phyics everything** \- but it isnt just the body that is physics based. Everything is a phyics based object that reacts like it would in the real world. You cant ghost through walls or tables, Tables can be flipped. Objects have weight so heavier objects are harder to move around, this is done by adding a delay to your movements and the object moving which we have seen already in early VR games like robo recall. The developers at epic games added a slight delay to when you moved the shotguns to try to make them feel weighty, It was very subtle and worked really well and we are seeing this same thing applied more and more in games like Blade and Scorcery and the upcoming walking dead saints and sinners game.

This is exciting because it adds so many possibilitys to how the game can be played and we have already seen a strong community get behind blade and sorcery with people spending hours messing around in what is just a sandbox tech demo right now.

**Boneworks Engine** \- from my understanding Boneworks is using Unity for the graphics side of things but the physics engine, the inverse kinematics etc has all been made in house by stress level zero. This means they can potentially sell boneworks as a plugin for other developers to use so indie developers can make there own games with all the benefits of Boneworks but without having to spend the many many hours coding everything. This could open up the potential for a new wave of VR games with all of these features which has huge potential and is very exciting. There has been no word on this from the develpers though so it will be interesting to see how that side of things develops.

**Half life 2 vibes** \- Another reason this game is getting so much hype is due to the similarities to Half Life, the developers havent shyed away from half life being an influence on the game design even showing the iconic crowbar and gravity gun in previous videos. It has a look and feel of a Valve game and people have even speculated about this being a valve game in disguise.

**Node Video** \- I think the last reason this game has built up such a lot of excitment within the VR community is down to the Videos made by Node showcasing the game. They did a really good job with the way they showed the gameplay highlighting all the reasons previously mentioned why this game could be a big deal and the Boneworks videos have gone viral.

I dont think there is one thing boneworks is doing better than any single game I think its a combination of all of these things that make it look like a really big step forward in many different ways and I cant wait to play it in December.

There are some concerns for me personally though, Mainly the actual content of the game. They have confirmed its going to have a story describing it as a narrative VR action adventure but no word on how long it will take and have been a little evasive on the steam forums when asked simply stating it varys from person to person. I understand it will vary but some sort of ball park figure would be good. If the singleplayer story is short and most of the game is just a physics based sandbox it will lose alot of appeal for me.

I personally prefer a game with progression and dont enjoy open ended sandbox games much but judging by Blade and Sorcery I may be in the minority on that one. They also have removed the shadows from the game as you can see in the latest trailer (shown in the video). The earlier footage has shadows and they even commented on the lighting in previous videos so its a little dissapointing to see the visuals take a step back although not a deal breaker and I understand its due to performance reasons as they are already pushing the CPU hard due to all the physics. I think an option to turn them on would be good even if its in some sort of advanced settings menu.

Lastly I have heard rumours the game is launching in early access, this is a personal thing but I dont like playing games with a single player campaign that are in early access, I prefer to wait for them to be finished so I can play through the final version of the game.

And thats it, hopefully some people found this interesting and I would be interested to hear what other peoples thoughts are on the game, are you excited or do you think its just a glorified tech demo?",oculus
"I see so much work and effort goes into animations in Star Citizen. A little bit crazy, because for VR this effort would be quite unneccessary.   
I really hope the development of Star Citizen has still VR-support in mind.",oculus
"Yeah, mostly all my games are SteamVR.",oculus
"Yeah, mostly all my games are SteamVR",oculus
My guess the only reason would be the superior tracking?,oculus
It is so frustrating. Has anyone gave you any troubleshoot methods to try?,oculus
"I would get the oculus quest.  Just mod the crap out of it for comfort and it would be surprising if you can't make it comfortable.  Then you get mobile, wireless, hand tracking, finger tracking, and pcvr with cable all in one headset.  No other headset offers all that in one.

Like someone else posted here, you may be fine with the rift S , you may not.  But from other posts here, you are almost certain to have better vision in the quest than rift S cause one eye at least will be affected by your ipd on the Rift S even if you can tolerate how much it is affected.",oculus
"Alternative ports too. I've been hosting some webvr tests with the python reference server which defaults to 8000. So long as i put the http:// at the front and the  :8000 on the end it just works for me. I can't think why else it might not work for you unless it's some wierd subnetting issue with WiFi and your quest can't see your pc at all, sorry.",oculus
They released an update which mostly fixed the tracking problems for shooters,oculus
"Quest will most likely be more popular, so I would say use that. The screens are pretty similar but I prefer quest. 

Don't worry about the refresh rate, they're both low, only 8fps difference. The smaller tracking volume is actually better on quest imo, because on the S there is less tracking by your waist as the front cameras are pointed forwards, but on the quest they are slightly downward-pointed.",oculus
"Yes, but Link and most Quest games don’t render at the full resolution, not in the periphery at least. Still looks amazing and I imagine that Link will get better.",oculus
"Ya im sitting here thinking the same thing going, "" why the fuck they even program that in? Who's gunna do that stupid shit?"".",oculus
"The negativity towards Star Citizen in a VR sub, especially after the recent outrage of ""flat gamers"" surprises me tbh.  
Just like VR, the developement of Star Citizen takes it's time and after 5 years of following it, I couldn't be more happy with what's to come in the next months and the current state of the game.  
Sure the development takes its time (just like VR) and there are many people who simply don't believe Star Citizen will ever be released, which is understandable to an extend (just like people who don't believe VR will ever be successful), but I believe that if CIG (Studio behind Star Citizen) continues to deliver the stuff we see on the game's roadmap, Star Citizen will be a huge milestone in the history of video games.",oculus
"Try launching them without starting up steamVR, a lot of games such as pavlov, contractors and so on have the oculus api integrated. So they run better without steamvr.",oculus
Oh I read it when they first posted it. I also know it’s a bunch of spin.,oculus
"It's not sinking cause AR/VR combination is coming soon.  Even apple is getting involved now and will be releasing headsets in a couple years.

I don't know is they will get rid of the odyssey+ too.  I think they want to stay in the game just to keep a name in it but don't want to spend too much money on the game until AR becomes widespread.  AR will become as ubiquitous as cell phones someday, maybe more so.  There's no way MS wants to exit that and AR/VR will be one in the same by then.",oculus
"So it's the devs choosing not to use the regional pricing, oculus really allows for it?

I wonder why the devs choose not to use it?  Is it because they don't know or because they make more profit by not discounting it?",oculus
"Yup, cant wait to play it 2030",oculus

Boneworks is coming in two weeks. That's what I'm getting with my refund money.,oculus
Do you agree with the Top 10? What's your top 10 list?,oculus
"It is firmly in tech demo territory for me, and I am not expecting any kind of coherent story that having it as early access would spoil.

I will definitely wait on a lot of reviews before pulling the plug on it, the footage I have seen so far isn't inspiring me.",oculus
"What made me buy the Rift S over the Quest was the battery life on the Quest and a graphics [comparison video](https://youtu.be/btb0gJT200U).

The feature I love on the Quest is the portability and fact that it's wireless, but that doesn't suit my play style. I often play for around four hours at a time which wouldn't be possible on a Quest without charging it. But then you have that cable connected to it, whether it's connected to an outlet or a power bank. There is no tripping over the wire, but still annoying. 

I don't see why you would go buy link, stuff for charging the Quest and eventually the cable for 80$ that's coming for Quest when you can just plug in the Rift S cable and have all that immediately.

But it really depends on your needs and wants. 
Do you want to easily bring it to your friends or family? Do you want the freedom of no wires? Is the battery time not a problem for you? Maybe you have a small room and are incapable of playing by your PC? Then maybe the Quest is a better alternative for you.

But I wouldn't recommend buying a Quest just to pretend it's a Rift S.

The things I feel like I'm missing out on with the Rift S is bringing the headset to my brother to show him, or hand tracking that's coming to Quest soon. The Quest is getting some cool stuff but the advantages of the Rift S are better than the advantages of the Quest, in my opinion. 

But as someone else mentioned, if it's your first VR headset, you will be happy with any of them. They are both good.",oculus
Depends on what you are developing and what you need to do in the headset.,oculus
"Yep, it's strange how they're spending so much money on hardware exclusives while also ignoring the need for something as simple as gift cards and game gifting.",oculus
"&gt;I invested a good few thousand dollars on this project some  years ago with the promise of VR support.

You can only blame yourself for spending so much money on something that might be. That sounds like the dumbest thing somebody could do with 2k.",oculus
"It will come in 2022, maybe 2023, assuming they don't go bankrupt before then.",oculus
"Best not to cherry pick the worst out of other games and boast.

I love my Rift S, but VR has its limitations as well.",oculus
"Animators take time and are slow... If mocap can get 80% of the way there with minimal effort... It is wayyyy more cost effective and for a background character probably won't need any cleanup.

Then I reread your statement about facial mocap for the bartender.... Now that's rediculous.",oculus
"The software IPD adjustment only moves the picture for each eye slightly altering how you see stuff, it doesn't do anything to help with the issue of the lenses not lining up with your eyes.",oculus
"this is wrong

"Really? Thats cool, I’ll have to give it a try at a friend’s, who still has one.",oculus
If you're only making PCVR games and not going to create a Quest port then I really don't see the point.  Stick to the Rift S.,oculus
I can't read minds. Explain,oculus
"FPS games. The headset will be used for playtesting (i.e. playing those games) and building up levels. Instead of building my own engine I will use Unreal Engine 4's built in VR features to make faster prototypes and maps.

This is the feature I intend to use it for: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKO9fEjNiio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKO9fEjNiio).

The intention is to avoid making a level, borrowing a university headset and then realize things are out of proportion, seem too big or obstructing the view of something that you are intended to see. Having my own, I can do VR playtests any time I want and get the scale and feel of environments correct right away.",oculus
"Thanks for pointing out the shadows being removed in the latest trailer, I thought something was off but I couldn’t put my finger on it.

However when you look back on the earlier videos on node where the shadows are enabled, I do hope they reconsider as it added a lot of fidelity to the game.

I’m still in team tech demo, as I also like profession more than sandbox stuff I’ll wait to buy for a while.

Let’s also hope that they will start selling the physics engine as a plug-in. That’d be sick!",oculus
The point is if the Quest Link will be better or more comfortable for your eyes during long use than the Rift S for PCVR games. So you don't think it is?,oculus
"Yeah, that is a fresh one. Shoot me your user name and I can send a direct invite if you'd like.",oculus
"You can do it, but it is pointless if you're looking for some sort of portable-installation, since it installs- and requires drivers and a two system services.",oculus
"Currently Link looks like a compressed youtube video. I dont know why people keep saying it looks like the Rift S when it clearly does not. I can only assume it is because of these people never seen Rift S. Dont make your decision thinking these are equivalent in picture quality, a compressed stream over USB is never going to look as sharp as a dedicated displayport.",oculus
"&gt; Star Citizen will be a huge milestone in the history of video games

Personally I expect by the time it is released it is outdated, simply because everyone is taking so long. 

&gt;  the developement of Star Citizen takes it's time 

But why didn't they realise this at CIG themselves? Why give release estimates which weren't even close? Literally telling something would be released in 2 weeks, which turned out to be more than half a year? That there are delays is fine, and kinda expected, but the size of the delays is just ridiculous. And always same story from fans: ""Everyone who has any experience in software development knows this would take so much time"". Then why didn't they realize this at CIG? In 2016 I was told by fan(boy)s that everyone knew it would take until 2017-2018 before it would be released, in 2017 I was told everyone knew it would take till 2018-2019 before it would be released, etc. The release is always 1-2 years in the future (okay, now more like 2-3 years).

And don't get me wrong: I also 'invested' €40 in it (worst investment ever :P), and would love to have a great game that I enjoy playing. But while I would love it, I don't believe in it anymore. Two major reasons for that: One is the delays, the other one are the details, and this is a prime example of that. They love making really detailed stuff. But they don't think if it makes sense for a gameplay perspective. I don't know current state of ships, since I haven't played for a long time, but at least when they first were released they were horrible to fly (even though I bought a HOTAS specifically for it). This was because they made detailed models of every ship, and then calculated with the trust of every single truster how the ship would behave (if you didn't have a fly-by-wire setup). Meanwhile E:D just made ships fly. One was more detailed, the other one was (imo) actually fun to play. Gameplay &gt; 'realism'.",oculus
"Yeah, looks fun, but I hope they will someday in the future use their skills and (if they have resources of course) build something with strong narrative/story. With such mechanics, that would be great.  


Like, that's why I fell in love with Half Life Alyx just by watching the trailer. It shows amazing gameplay (like all the physics stuff) but also I can feel the atmosphere just by watching a video and I know it will have ""traditional"" story like ""normal"" game :P",oculus

This is just sad.,oculus
"The problem is not really the compression, the problem is they downscale the image to 1008x1120 per eye to send it to the Quest which is too low (even with the FFR resampling applied). ALVR and VD can send higher resolution and hence they look sharper. Oculus said in the blog post that they will enable some settings to be changed in future updates so we can tweak it based on hardware and personal preferences.",oculus
"If you have a particularly wide or small IPD the Quest will be comfortable on your eyes. Otherwise the weight of the headset will be much more uncomfortable than the Rift S, especially during long sessions. I can't last longer than 30 minutes in the Quest due to neck and cheek pain.",oculus
I have said this mutliple times over at /r/OculusQuest and get downvoted into oblivion. Everyone with eyes can see that the current VD and ALVR solutions look sharper than Link.,oculus
"No not really. The Quest is fine and all, but the Rift S was specifically designed as a PCVR, including the head holster, the length and durability of the cable, and overall comfort.

Quest was designed as a standalone headset, so they had to do some minor sacrifices in comfort and play length wise. The Link is just an added (and welcomed) features but never accounted originally to be used for PCVR.

Eye comfort wise, I can't actually tell. They both seem fine. The Quest of course seems to have better color wise but a bit of the resolution is lowered. It hard to see but it's there if you look for it.",oculus
"I hope the foundation for future games isn't people paying for virtual items to fund a decade long development cycle that stands as the epitome of scope creep.

Star Citizen is the Bradley Fighting Vehicle of video games.",oculus
What's your experience with horror games in VR?,oculus
It feels like something from 10 million years ago!,oculus
I wasn't talking about the business model. I hope that doesn't carry into other games either. I was referring to the advancements they're making in simulating effects,oculus
"It wouldn't even have to be at the level ALVR allows for example, just higher than the current 1008x1120 per eye that they are sending. A bit of tweaking for the render resolution of 1818x2000 and the downsampled encoded image resolutions of 1008x1120 would be nice. To bring them closer a bit. And the option to switch to h265 for those of us with Turing cards.",oculus
"There's not really a simple answer to this as you're essentially asking how physics engines work in their entirety. 

But as a cliff notes sort of thing, it's all equations using known formula from the real world such as friction, momentum, angular velocity, all that good stuff. 

Collision detection is it's own thing and is done in different ways depending on the objects involved and your performance requirements. 

Both of the above will have various forms of estimation/rounding depending on the games needs and performance requirements, that and the fact that computers aren't that great with fractions. 

Game engines like unreal and unity have their own physics code and collision detection you can use out of the box. But for games like eleven or boneworks where they try to up the realism they tend to write their own instead to have finer control over the output.",oculus
That's very impressive. Any plans to make it compatible with the Quest?,oculus
"nr1 i do use 144hz, but rift s and quest  80vs72 it nearly identical and really hard to feel, quest maybe will get 90hz mode, it got rooted and stuff, rift s will never get it  
nr2 quest are main vr platform now, monay it generate is literally ""times"" better vs pcvr and some dev say it better then psvr so yea, you need to have skills for mobile vr  
nr3 sde is hardware stuff, and it really personal, for some it bad for same it  ""i do not care category "" and you are correct, quest do have better visuals - oled and stuff, rift s have better ""quality""  
nr4 comfort is strange mistress , for some halo is good for some starp are good, in any case is not a main problem , you can mod headset to fit your needs more  
in any case if you are really into vr development you need quest , oculus GO developers got huge head start vs pcvr devs and reaps huge benefits in quest.",oculus

"Now if only they didn't develope the shallowest game possible, and the grindiest one too.

Not saying SC has a much more engaging gameplay loop but ED is just a boring game all around, most of the time you drive around empty space to make the money to do some arcady combat and that's it.",oculus
are you dumb,oculus
"Adding to this: Please also dont forget that developing entire new technologies simply takes time.

There have been many games with way less scope, but similar development times already.The difference is, that those games got announced shortly before they have been finished, while SC has been an open project since the beginning.It took a team of hundreds of experienced professionals a few years just for the engine and groundwork alone.Other AAA Studios spend a similar amount of time on their engines or even longer. They just manage to push out games inbetween that only need what features are already available. This simply doesn't work with SC.

Sure E:D started at a similar time, but E:D isnt exactly content rich to a similar scope and was fairly barren for the longest of times. Hell E:D was THE space truck simulator for years after its release. Everything else came later and took even longer to work fine/be balanced.",oculus

"Well, the HL VR announcement has somewhat eclipsed this game for me but I'm still getting it on release as a taste of what's to come in 4 months. The length of the game is also my biggest concern.",oculus
"The problem is that even 3-4 years into development they posted stuff that I as a hobbyist knew was beginners stuff in their dev blog. Being open is positive, but it just showed most of them have no clue what they are doing. It's largely still a Cryengine walking simulator demo. With horrible animations and movement. But it's slowly getting there on the space bits now, luckily. 

I just personally think they chose the wrong approach. Elite Dangerous made the basics early, so there's always a game there whether you enjoy it or not. Star Citizen has never been a game until maybe the last year.",oculus
Yes! After PCVR launch and everything is polished and optimized,oculus
"No its basically full physics simulation. You specify your solds (the ground, walls, table, ball, racket, etc...) , specify their material data (rubber, wood, metal, etc...) that decides their behavior (bouncy, rigged, etc...), you apply the forces (gravity, wind, racket hitting ball, ball hitting table, etc...) and the physics engine/library does the rest.

"Thank you for being honest. This is why I asked. I don't care how well the games made especially for the Quest runs since that's not what I'll be using it for.

I am guessing it's because people are trying to justify their purchase. Kind of like how people who got the Xbox One said it was superior to the PS4, even though the hardware clearly was not.

Hello, technically we only support laptops that have passed the Oculus Ready program, and this is because of the reason you mentioned in your post. You can go here for more information:  [https://www.oculus.com/oculus-ready-pcs](https://www.oculus.com/oculus-ready-pcs/)

MSI did release an updated VBIOS for their laptops, so I recommend reaching out to their support to both get the appropriate VBIOS for this specific laptop, and so they can give you instructions on how to update.

Note: VBIOS is different than just the regular BIOS for the laptop, VBIOS is specifically for the GPU on the laptop, so just updating the BIOS for the laptops motherboard likely won't be enough.",oculus

"""Personally I expect by the time it is released it is outdated, simply because everyone is taking so long.""  

Well, part of why it's taking so long is actually them keeping it up to date (visually and technically)  

""But why didn't they realise this at CIG themselves?""  

They probably did, but failed or even refused to communicate it. Like I said, I am following the developement of the game for more than 5 years now and especially the years between 2015-2017 were full of wrong estimates and bad communication. Stuff was delayed for over a year and I think this was the point where many people lost faith in CIG.  
Over the past two years the communication by CIG has improved a lot though, there is a detailed roadmap about the upcoming features of the game and a quarterly release schedule for new patches.  
Sure, even with the roadmap features get delayed sometimes but at least they give an explanation on why a particular feature was delayed.  
Now on the gameplay side of things... well, I know that many people would prefer a more simple approach to some aspects of the game (like the flight model) but there is also a huge amount of people who enjoy just that, a more realistic approach of such things (not a huge fan of the flight model either, but it's decent). 
Fidelity is a huge part of Star Citizens identity and I know this isn't well received by everybody but I personally wouldn't be such a big fan of the project if it wasn't for all the crazy details in the game.",oculus

"&gt; And the option to switch to h265 for those of us with Turing cards.

Pascal can do h.265 encoding just fine, even with HDR. I think even Maxwell can do h.265, but just 8 bits.

I'm pretty sure the reason h.264 is being used is because the decoder is faster when using h.264. In AL-VR, h.264 is about 10 ms faster than h.265 if I recall correctly (not sure if it's gotten better, but that's what it was)",oculus
"If you only want tethered PC VR, buy the Rift S. It will (probably) be more comfortable and will have  better screen clarity.

I will get the game to support these guys because I like that they are pushing limits in VR. At the same time I have concern that people have hyped this game up way too much for what it is and there could be a backlash when it gets released because it doesnt match the high expecations that people have set.  It looks like Blade and Sorcery but with guns and robot dummies.,oculus

When folks spend too much on hardware they need things like this to help them justify it. Mark my words ""Have you tried it with the Index controllers?"" will be the retort to any criticism. 

Sadly, a great physics engine without a story isn't going to go to far and nothing I've seen in the gameplay hints to any sort of deep underlying narrative for me. Folks aren't talking, computers are being accessed,  other humans aren't about... the ""story"" seems to be one that is told by moving boxes and shoving stuff around. Maybe I'm just sick of the low budget excuses that always leave you the ""lone survivor"" in empty worlds as an justification for not hiring voice actors and spending any time with motion capture.",oculus
Months doesn't sound too bad.,oculus
"Highly unlikely, but depends on how the game sold, I suppose. I remember Fallout 76, which also released November 14th, same as Stormland, being more than 40% off on Black Friday.

If you want to have the best PCVR experience, Rift S is your choice. If you want to have access to showing your friends VR easily, and have access to PCVR, the Quest can do both of those with the Link. If you desire the most comfortable experience, the Rift S would be better, as many people consider the Quest to be very uncomfortable and front-heavy.

"Quest doesn't connect to your GPU. If you want to use the Quest as a PCVR headset it uses a usb 3.0 cable to stream compressed video instead. 

You don't need to worry about Optimus in that case. However link functionality is currently in beta and the mobile 1060 GPU is not officially supported, there have been cases of it working to varying degrees but it's not a guarantee.

Finally, until Oculus releases the official Link cable (5M) for $80 it's up to you to find and purchase a suitable USB 3.0 cable which can be difficult if you want length over 3 meters.",oculus

"One thing to check is if the games can be run without SteamVR - if you right-click the game or a popup appears while running it that lets you run it in 'Oculus VR mode', then it'll be exactly the same as if you bought it on the Oculus Store.

For some games (which are made in Unity and don't have a menu option) you need the `-vrmode oculus` flag.

Because the Rift S is on sale soon, you'll probably end up spending about \~$100-$140 more to get the Quest and a link cable vs a Rift S.

But the Quest is what I'd recommend.  It's also the headset that Oculus is putting most of its future effort into (e.g. hand tracking), so, there's that too.  Plus, while the Rift S matches your IPD, if you have friends/family who want to try out VR, the Quest having the mechanical IPD slider is nice.

If you're uncertain, there are some graphics quality comparisons where someone took a camera to the lenses so you can get a sense of the image differences.

"Your link talks about a ""3D sensor,"" and this [camera speculation article](https://wccftech.com/2020-iphone-design-new-5g-camera-upgrades/) linked from your link specifically mentions a time-of-flight depth sensor. Those two mentions are consistent, but they are not what you probably think they are.

Specifically, it's not a stereo camera that could directly record stereoscopic video, which is what you probably mean by ""3d video."" It's a sensor package comparable to the Kinect-for-Xbox-One, meaning it directly creates a 3D map of the environment.

If such a 3D map is combined (texture mapped) with the RGB feed from a regular camera, it can in fact be used to create 3D reconstructions that can be viewed in VR, and they even have benefits over stereo recordings because they are truly three-dimensional, i.e., support (limited) motion parallax.

The issue is that that's not the 3D sensor's purpose, and it will therefore probably not work very well. If I were to guess, the 3D sensor will probably have a few hundred by a few hundred pixels, and a maximum distance of a few meters, because that's what's needed to support the AR applications Apple are most probably aiming for.",oculus

"Your friend may be what Hong Kong people call cockroaches (Hong Kong people say that thugs are cockroaches), and the pollution police are their common means of external communication, but there is no actual evidence, just oral statements.Most of the Hong Kong mobs are students and underage. They don't understand what freedom and democracy are, and even don't understand the law. They are easily incited, just like the Red Guards. But they are good at using the Internet, plus the support of the United States, which is why you always hear their voices on the Internet. In the parade to support China, adults and middle-aged people are the majority, and they have more mature ideas.You only need to search for related images to prove this.

The NBA did not expel Morey. Adam Silver said that the NBA supports freedom, but they fired the Clippers captain, which is a double standard. They are obviously affected by the pressure from American political circles. Blizzard banned any political remarks, which is no problem, but they still withdrew some punishments, which is also the impact of US political pressure.

Since ancient times, the people's Republic of China has always had sovereignty over Tibet and Taiwan. During the period of the Republic of China, Tibet and Taiwan still had sovereignty. The people's Republic of China only inherited the territory of the Republic of China. By the way, the government of the Republic of China went to Taiwan and became the government of Taiwan.
You actually think that Tibet and Taiwan should not be Chinese territory. This is the negative impact of the American media on you. India also claims that they should have sovereignty over Tibet, but they are not even the same race.

I have already said it. Any evidence that the police pretend to be a mob is not meaningful. The parade that supports the police is the ordinary people, and in your mouth they become jokes? https://twitter.com/GDHKMBayArea/status/1145530180753973248

No, you don't need to say it out loud, as long as they suspect that you are a Chinese mainlander, they will attack you, just like the Japanese who were beaten by mobs. The police's family members will also be threatened and insulted, and their information will be sent to the Internet. Many police families were forced to live in the Mainland.

"The gameplay and traversal is the big attraction. If you dont care for it then SL isnt for you. I have 20 hrs in SL, the story is shallow, gameplay is repetitive, but I find traversal mechanics to be amazingly fun (slipstreaming, flying, climbing). 

Once you beat the main campaign (took me 7 hrs), then you repeat the 3 realms and fight the tempest in the terminus realm (took me another 6 hrs). Once that's done then you repeat. To fully beat the game's story, I envision it being 20+ hrs (see below)

Theres the weekly reset that drastically changes the island layout (the island layout is denser us the cycling world vs the campaign), and theres collectables that you can scan for audio log that gives background info to the story. If you beat the terminus that week (3 realms + terminus realm), then the game world the following week goes 1 step higher in difficulty (escalation level 1). That means more difficult and greater amount of enemies, but the gameplay is the same.

The only thing I havent done yet is the secret ending that occurs once you beat the terminus at escalation 2 difficulty. Once I do this I'll probably be done with the game, which I'll probably be at around 30 hrs.

Stormland isnt the big content game like Asgards wrath (which is better than SL), but imo SL it's still pretty good and a worthy title to have just for the traversal mechanics",oculus

For example the video compression is noticeable, and the 3m cable length is going to be a deal breaker for some people.",oculus

"The quest has a lot less power than a pc so games need a version thats optimized for tze quest. Due to this the library is more limited and you cant run steam vr normally. 

But they recently added a feature called quest link which allows you to use your quest as a pcvr headset with an usb 3 cable with atleast 1 type c end. However their official 5m cable will releae next year so for now the cables that work are not optimal and only 3m long at most. The visuals might be a little worse when doing this compared to a rift s but nothing unusable.

A rift s or a linked quest can run all games on the oculus store and can also use steamvr and steam games and even viveport.

As for modding not dure what exactly you mean but you can run indie games that are not on a store and if a game is moddable like skyrim vr or beatsaber than you can mod it and a linked quest works just like a rift s.

The non linked quest is a little bit more closed off but modding games like beatsaber to allow custom songs is not completely impossible.",oculus

"You are only reluctant to face reality in many practical .Can only adopt the strategy of ""I don't look"".evidences.The economy of Hong Kong is declining. As Hong Kong's universities are occupied by mobs, university rankings are seriously declining. Shenzhen is accelerating in the complete replacement of Hong Kong's economy. The people who actually receive the loss are Hong Kong people, not mainland China.

Don't talk nonsense, you can send out the ""evidence"" you said. I can perfectly rebut them one by one. Your ""evidence"" comes from Western media such as BBC, CNN or US websites. This is a very single source of information. But I often read the news published in China and browse websites such as Twitter and youtube. So I can summarize more diverse information.For China.  A lot of western media evidence and 9/11 conspiracy theories, moon landing is bogus, ebola virus is made in the United States. There is no essential difference between these conspiracy theories.

Democracy is not the majority of people rejecting a few. You are not familiar with the concept of democracy. According to your point of view, the Germans slaughter Jews is also a kind of democracy.Then if China’s 1.3 billion people decide to suppress Hong Kong mobs, it’s also a democracy.

The focus of democracy is to allow all the different voices to be heard by the masses, Rather than banning minority views.You have to know that public opinion itself is the result of being manipulated by the government.When political parties within the United States compete with each other, public opinion can be diversified. But in the face of a country like China, whose rapid rise threatens the international status of the United States, different parties will reach a consensus. That is to curb the development of China.

The point is that the reddit mechanism leaves room for government operations. Just like youtube can cancel a channel subscription in the background.

"Well, quite frankly yes, productivity apps would be a boon to the platform and I'd love to see them show up on the Oculus Store.

It's all quite easy honestly, I can walk you through it sometime if you'd like a hand hold, or direct you to one of several videos.

"&gt; With AADT, a pair of undistorted eye-buffers rendered at 3616x2000 can  be compressed down to 2016x1120 saving close to 70% of the video codec  budget. AADT not only saves codec bandwidth, but it also saves latency  by making sure the encoder and decoder work on smaller images. While  these numbers are tuned for the Oculus recommended-specification  hardware, they might be updated for better visual fidelity in future  releases. 

This explains why in SteamVR it said 1808x200 per eye when set to 100% resolution. Good to see some additional confirmation that there may b exposed settings for the values in the future, it sure would be nice to be able to send something better than a 1008x1120 image to the 1440x1600 displays.

I also have a friend who has a 1060M in his machine and our laptops perform at the exact same level, in multiple games that we've tested, with the same driver and same graphical settings. Sometimes mine performs better, and in some instances so much better than expected for whatever reason.

"Dirt Rally is pretty extreme, even VR veterans can get sick. In addition there is a setting in the game where you can either fix the horizon so the car moves around as it bounces or you move with the car.

"About Motion Sickness:

Got a Rfit S four days ago. Just wanted to try it out, mostly because Valve is making a full fledged single player VR game. Sorry Oculus games team, but that is what gave me the last push I needed. Still, I bought Lone Echo. First, it is a mind-blowing experience! I'm on a space station in space. Holy \*\*\*\*! 

But motion sickness was a huge problem on my first day with the game. Only played for a couple of minutes and I was done, even felt sick for an hour afterwards. On my second day I tried out a bit less mobile games like Batman VR, Rick and Morty and a couple demos. On my third day I was able to do slow movement in Lone Echo, grab things and enjoy the experience more (\~45 minutes). On my forth day I'm browsing through the station and am even able to rotate myself while doing so. It is still not 100% fine, but already better. I'll ""train"" more in the coming days, but this ""I tried VR and was motion sick"" stuff. Yes, most people will have problems on day one (AND you really need to be careful!) But our brains are excellent at adapting and learning, you will (most likely) overcome it. 

I'm always motion sick the first day while sailing (not doing it enough) too. Many people are, but I never witnessed more than three days.

&amp;#x200B;

Could somebody please recommend me good, not expansive, over ear headphones please. In-ear never felt comfortable and is falling out. My PC headset is comfortable but doesn't fit over the Rift S. And the Rift S sound isn't as terrible as some people say, but it's also not good either.",oculus

"The reason you got sick in dirt is your vision was being moved around by the car and your body wasn't moving. If you aren't used to vr your brain gets confused by that  and makes you feel ill. That's also one of the more extreme experiences for you to be trying, not recommended for someone starting out. 
You were fine in beat saber because you were the one physically in control of your movements. So you are fine to get racing games, just build up your tolerance to vr :D first by playing less intense seated or physical movement games.",oculus

And I’ve been doing VR regularly since 2012.

I still take a cautious approach when talking about simsickness as I’ve noticed when demoing to people they are clearly simsick but the wow factor overused that.

"Releasing an updated Quest with greater performance would split the market too quick.  As Michael Abrash stated at OC6, this is the Quest generation and it'll last longer by years than previously expected.
 
 
They are now concentrating on growing the market(with what they have now) and keeping the hardware the same for a more console-like cycle(e.g. 5~6 years).  Unless, there is competition for standalone, but that's looking pretty non-existent at present.  Though, Samsung may surprise there.
 
 
I do agree that the Rift S is likely to have a shorter life-span, similar to how Lenovo stopped producing their previous VR headset, the Explorer.  But this time, it's likely because Facebook will see little point continuing a contract with Lenovo, when they can marshal all their support &amp; resources into Quest(and Oculus Link).",oculus

"&gt; Hey! I work at Oculus (Technically part of the broader Facebook AR/VR org). I've extensively tested out Rift S (Laguna) and Quest internally before they were released. This is an incremental upgrade, and in some ways a ""sideways"" upgrade. I recommend people who already have a Rift to not upgrade now, but for those who are thinking about getting a headset to get the Rift S.  
&gt;  
&gt;That being said, we are already putting the finishing touches on the next headset. Hardware is mostly locked down, and its vastly improved over the Rift S. I don't want to give away too many details, but you won't have to wait another 3 years for a Rift upgrade. It's coming next year!

""With AADT, a pair of undistorted eye-buffers rendered at 3616x2000 can be compressed down to 2016x1120 saving close to 70% of the video codec budget. AADT not only saves codec bandwidth, but it also saves latency by making sure the encoder and decoder work on smaller images. **While these numbers are tuned for the Oculus recommended-specification hardware, they might be updated for better visual fidelity in future releases.**""

"&gt; It might turn out that Cardboard et al. poisoned the VR well more than we would have liked to admit back then.

What poisoned VR was raising the launch price of the Rift to $600. That's the exact moment when VR went from being the next big thing to ""fuck this shit"" for a hell of a lot of people. Quality of Cardboard was never a problem, since nobody expected a $5 headset to provide an amazing experience. The problem was that there was nothing affordable to replace that Cardboard with.

That's a problem that persists to this day, HP Reverb, Vive Pro, Cosmos, Index, Pimax all *raised* the price of VR instead of lowering it. Even Rift S managed to raise the price from the late CV1s. WMRs are the only ones that got really cheap, but even they only got cheap after they didn't sell with their initially high launch price and lack of advertisement ensured that nobody outside of VR circles ever knew they exist. On top of that they are all going out of stock now or haven't even been available outside the USA, so another increase of the price of entry-level VR is ahead of us.

Now it's not like there weren't problems with the quality of the experience. PSVR recycling the old Move controllers was a mistake. Google continuing phone-VR with Daydream instead of moving straight to a Go/Quest self-contained design was another. But overall it all comes down to price and content, that's where VR continues to fail, quality of the headset is really a secondary concern.",oculus

I didn't know Half Life 2 destroyed them, but like, that's a fixable problem right? Reign in the crunch. Set a looser schedule. Give people a year away from the project. Lord knows they can afford all three of those things. As horrifying of a crunch that must have been, I can tell they've recovered from it, since they've made Portal 2. But listen to what he said in the interview, he didn't say ""we were all just so devastated from working endlessly"", he said they were intimidated by half life 3. I am \*not\* one of the ""half life 3 confirmed"" memers who is putting them into a lose-lose scenario. I'm just a normal gamer, who wanted a conclusion to the cliffhanger from ep 2, who was expecting a fun shooter, like they always consistently make. I wasn't expecting the second coming. No game can be that. The fact that they had to trick themselves into working on half life again by doing it in a prequel is very curious and revealing to me. They have totally psyched themselves out over 3. It'll just be a another video game at the end of the day, and there's no reason they can't approach it with the same kind of development they used to create Half Life Alyx. 

I mean, hell, take this game that they literally just made, throw in a cutscene that says ""we thought we had to go north, but looks like we need to teleport back to city 17!"", and then some more cutscenes to tie up loose ends.

"The whole Rift washed out colours and blacks thing was always a little overblown, it's just another well calibrated LCD screen. The OLED screen on the Quest can look great but imo the calibration is a bit off and colours can be oversaturated.
I have to agree on Link though, i get better image quality, better colours and better black levels with Virtual Desktop compared to Link with only 1 frame higher latency.
And people need to stop sayig ""it's just a beta chill"", betas are made for feedback, if everyone just ignores flaws then they won't know what to improve.
As a first beta release it's alright but the 150mbps encoder limit could be a huge problem, if VD can cut down even more an latency then Link will be in a weird spot at least for me.
You can buy VD, a great router and a powerbank that will last you 7-8 hours for less than the official Link cable.

Rift S is a native PC headset. It offers better visual fidelity and better controller latency than the Quest+Link. This is a Po C only headset, no standalone capabilities",oculus

"I tried it out with my Surface Book 2 15”, and TL:DR - same issue as you, and Link won’t start on the headset, but I’m cautiously optimistic it will be updated to work as the beta progresses/moves to final (but it could also never be supported). Full explanation here:

I got the Anker cable recommended by Oculus Link Support site (https://support.oculus.com/444256562873335/), which is a USB-A 3.0 to USB-C cable, plugged everything in to my Surface Book 2 15”, and the Oculus App went through the setup without issue. In the headset itself I clicked “Enable Oculus Link (beta)” (in the Quest settings), and it kept kicking me back multiple times. Eventually I unplugged the USB cable from the computer, plugged it back in, the screen went dark, came back on, and asked if I wanted to give the device access. I clicked  ok, and then tried to clicking the “Enable Oculus Link” button in the settings again - and it said “PC Not Detected”. I unplugged again, plugged it back, this time clicked “deny” and hit the “enable” button in the settings again - same result (PC not detected). I did this a few times, then decided to restart the computer - since I also had the same red band error (more on that shortly).

After restarting, I opened the Oculus app with the headset still connected, and in the headset a window came up asking me if I wanted to enable Link - that was different and seemed good, since I did not get this pop up previously. I clicked enable... and it went briefly black, then back to the home screen, with no change. So, not so good, after all. I tried hitting the “enable” option in the settings again, it went black, then back to the home screen. After doing this a few times, it popped up again with “PC Not Detected.” So, I’m going in circles.

The thing is: the Oculus app on my computer says the headset is set up properly and indicates it IS connected - so I know the cable and connection works, but it just won’t start Link on the headset. As indicated above, I ALSO have the red error bar in the Oculus app about “encountering an error” and suggesting I restart, BUT, that has ALWAYS been in my Oculus app since well before Link was even  announced (I tried setting up a Rift-S on my surface book right after it was released, and that error came on and never went away). I don’t know if the error is related or not, but since it’s always been there (before Oculus Link), I’m thinking it’s not related... but the fact that Link isn’t working may be related to the GPU.

That Oculus support website I have linked up there has a compatibility list indicating what cards are and are not supported. The 1060 DESKTOP version is supported - 1060m is not (currently). This is likely why it’s not working - but there are a few things to note about that:

1. There technically is no 1060m, as far as I know - and the Surface Pro 2 card is definitely not branded as 1060m. Nvidia has branded both the desktop and laptop versions of the 1060 with the same name, because they are extremely similar (same memory, same number of shader units, etc.)... but they are not exactly the same (the mobile version is slightly less powerful in a few areas, including clock speed). That said, the desktop and mobile versions of other cards on the list are both supported.

2. The site indicates that as the beta progresses, they will be (hopefully) moving more GPU’s to the “supported” column - and not long ago the desktop 1060 was unsupported, too. That changed fast - and the fact that the mobile 1060 is still unsupported, but they are so similar, means it may be supported soon... but there is no guarantee.

3. Upload VR has an article (https://uploadvr.com/oculus-link-beta-supported-gpus/) which hypothesizes that the reason the mobile version is not supported is because Nvidia’s NVENC chip, specifically for video encoding, which Link may be using to get the appropriate video/data to transfer over USB 3.0. This is entirely a guess (though not a bad one) and UploadVR says that the desktop 1060 has the chip, but not the mobile 1060 - which may be the problem. This is also a guess... and I’m not convinced the 1060 mobile variant doesn’t have the NVENC chip. The UploadVR article references an Nvida site about the chip (https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-decode-gpu-support-matrix), which UploadVR says does not list the 1060m... but that page lists the 1060 twice. It is very possible that one of those two is the 1060m (especially since, as noted, the 1060m technically doesn’t exist - they’re both just called 1060). There are other m-branded cards there, though - so it is possible that the mobile variant of the 1060 is absent... however, next to both of the 1060 entries, in a section for “Desktop/Mobile/Server,” BOTH entries say D/M (for desktop and mobile). Other “m” entries (like 1070m/1080m) ONLY list M in that column. The 1080 (not 1080m) also lists D/M. This is very unlikely to be a mistake in the chart, and that implies, to me, that the mobile 1060 used in the Surface Pro 2 (which, again, is NOT branded as 1060m) does have the NVENC. That is entirely a guess on my part, though, and is no more valid than the UploadVR guess.

Anyway - all of this is to say that I am still cautiously optimistic that in a month or two the 1060m may become supported. If and when it is, if it still doesn’t work on the Surface Book 2, we can get reaching out to Oculus to find out what gives.

In the meantime, I’ll be periodically plugging my headset back in and trying it out again.",oculus

"It's because Half Life is a huge IP, mostly because it's become a meme over the years. Oculus AAA games haven't featured IP that big. I guarantee if a AAA Pokemon game was announced for VR the hype would eclipse Half Life: Alyx hype, simply because the IP is bigger and the fanbase is more active.

"If you are even remotely interested in playing anywhere you want, wirelessly, I have to say I think you should go for a Quest.

The Quest looks pretty damn good if you have a good PC, and will only get better as the Beta moves forward to full release.  Having an IPD adjustment and the ability to take it on the go makes it an easy decision over the Rift S for me.  Obviously it will not be quite as sharp as the Rift S or Valve Index, but Defector looked and played amazingly on the Quest.  Please note that I have modded my Quest quite a bit to make it comfortable.  I have the Vive Deluxe audio strap installed as well as the StudioForm strap and a silicon cover over the face pad.

"The higher resolution panel of the Quest doesn't apply when playing PC games.

PC native headsets, like your WMR Explorer and Rift S,  connect to both your OC usb 3 port and your GPU.

Whereas, Quest ONLY connects to a USB port. Thus, all the data it s transmitted over a single usb cable, which limits the visual fidelity of the Quest+Link

Oh yes, I completely agree - they're selling it to promote SteamVR not the Index specifically, so this was certainly the right decision.

&gt; It's not the same at all. ReVive is a community workaround, which does not work very well on many games. SteamVR fully supports the Oculus natively. I know about the issues, as I said I was on both sides, I owned an oculus and I own an Index. One is much much worse than the other.

It's not a particularly good analogy, but it was the closest one I could think of.

Secondly, what if the game developer endorsed ReVive and made efforts to make it work properly?

Finally, SteamVR works differently for different people. For some people it's just fine, for others it's a huge, **huge** issue that makes them almost never buy games not on the Oculus store (and I'm in the latter category).

"That's exactly what I've always experienced.  It often wouldn't switch it at all.  Sometimes it would switch it, then wouldn't switch back on exit when it was supposed to.  It's so rare to launch a Steam VR game and then not have to take the headset off and fiddle with the sound, often then needing to relaunch hoping that it'll take up the change.",oculus
well also they are going to fund fewer PC VR games anyway because it's not a focus of their business,oculus

That's great and all but this is mostly about Oculus making it difficult in the first place. We want them to open up their store so this kind of thing isn't necessary in the first place.

That sucks but the same can be said for ReVive, but at least with steam you can open a Ticket to valve and get help about it, since the Oculus is officially supported. It is still fundamentally different.

"Let's be honest: Valve has so far been pretty concealed. Yeah, they did Lab and SteamVR is impressive despite its shortcomings, nevermind all the hardware efforts - but especially when talking about gameplay literals like the ubiquitous tele-grab (which some games like Pavlov still haven't discovered) and all the other things we've seen in the trailer, someone else did it first, probably in a concerted effort. EG has done plenty stuff with Robo Recall, handling physical puppets alone is something we've figured out decently.

As far as the trailer is concerned, there is nothing innovative. The real big one here is them making it fun, iterating on what we know already. Half-Life 1 wasn't the huge pioneering shooter either, as much as people want to remember it as such, it just did everything we knew about fps games really, really well.

In-universe integration of VR mechanics are just part of the polish and bound to feel amazing. Also, sick atmospheric scattering effects and backlight wrapping around subjects. This is what's going to be great, awesome level design and good gameplay.",oculus

8GB DDR4

I know these are a tad below recommended and I hear it can get even more intensive, so I'd like to know before making any purchases.",oculus
VR games usually don't let you grab static scenery because as soon as you move you move away there's a disconnect between where you real and virtual hands are. Valve would likely want to avoid that.,oculus

"&gt; That's great and all but this is mostly about Oculus making it difficult in the first place. We want them to open up their store so this kind of thing isn't necessary in the first place.

IIRC there were a couple of games early on that shipped on Steam after being developed with only support for LibOVR, which ended up officially supporting ReVive - this is what I was referring to in my original post.

If Oculus added Vive/Index support by proxying to SteamVR, I'd expect a large number of the issues SteamVR has would apply to it - what we really need is for more people to use OpenXR, and Valve to hurry up and implement it.

(obviously this won't help exclusivese where they intentionally don't work on other hardware - no API can solve this)

&gt; That sucks but the same can be said for ReVive, but at least with steam you can open a Ticket to valve and get help about it, since the Oculus is officially supported. It is still fundamentally different.

For those games (I forget which ones they were) you could ask the developer if you were having issues with ReVive, as they officially supported it.

&gt; Now all this being said, and to make it clear I am not a SteamVR ""fanboy"" I know the pain of SteamVR, even if it *does* work as expected. Even if you own an Index SteamVR is a pile of garbage, so a lot of the issues are not as a result of using a different headset anyway.

I actually haven't had that many issues with it on the Vive. It would crash on (relatively rare) occasion and of course it didn't have Dash and PTW and all that cool stuff, but it was functional and I was able to actually play games on it fairly reliably.

This issue seems specific to SteamVR's Rift driver, which is where my complaints mainly lie.",oculus

I wouldn't consider a single Facebook game even close to AAA except /maybe/ Asgard's Wrath.  Sony games aren't on PC and have awful tracking and lack the interactivity that PC games have.  I've been using VR since DK1 and HLVR is easily the most impressive looking VR anything I've seen.,oculus

Yeah they wouldn't make a triple A game. But you don't have to. Publishers have understood for a while that you can make smaller games with a vision that make their investment back either through straight profits or with goodwill and marketing. They just haven't been doing that with VR.",oculus

That's good news. Valve surely has all the relevant data. When they throw their most valuable brand into the market and put in the effort to make a AAA game just for VR - i would suspect they see a healthy market there,oculus

"Update: I have since deleted local folders to start clean, updated to PTC to see if an obscure fix was made by accident, and scavenged what few places I can find literally any info for anything that ever went wrong with Oculus's app. I have so far had zero luck. The problem is made worse by the fact it's so difficult to tell what the program is actually thinking or doing.

The fact that it just crashes with no warning and constantly resetting makes me think it's the software itself being programmed by cheap interns out of an overpriced college. I'd like to not be soured, but nothing working properly despite me trying nearly everything and spending hours trying to make this work is trying my patience, and this is coming from a dev and Linux hobbyist who is used to debugging and scavenging for solutions and scotch tape.

Is there literally no one aside from this official support who has some sense from my problem what could be going on or what could be tried? I have very low hopes of getting anything useful from the support tickets I've sent in, from the track record I'm generally hearing.",oculus
It's better than giving us extended hands like with long gloves that don't bend at the wrist so there's that but in Echo games IK is pretty spot on. And sure unti there's actual tracking there's always room for error and some games do poor job of IK but it can be done well.,oculus
"&gt;I've owned the Vive (original) Rift, Rift S and now the Quest

Hi! I was wondering if I could pick your brain for a sec -- Alyx has reinvigorated my thirst to buy a VR headset and I'm sussing between Rift S and Quest. Since you've had both, I was wondering -- in terms of screen quality / refresh rate, do you prefer the Rift S or the Quest w/ Link? Watched countless YouTube videos last few hours and not many specify which screens they prefer. I had a buddy lend me his Vive for a week so I've had a bit of experience with playing for VR. I know everyone is praising the Quest but going from 90hz on the Vive (to be fair, was a while ago) to 72hz, do you notice a moderate difference?",oculus

I will finish Asgards Wrath, but probably not bother with the side quests, and then go back to Skyrim.   I know the melee combat isnt as good, but if you role play like a D&amp;D session it can be immersive (rather than waggle killing everything)",oculus

I haven't used a 90Hz headset for a while but I don't miss it, I do use a 165Hz monitor so it's not like I can't notice the added smoothness from higher refresh rates, I just think the 72Hz is enough

The Rift S screen is better, but not by as much as I was expecting. The Quest screens look great and to me, FOV is king and the Rift S is really lacking in that regard",oculus

"it's the first and most important game that valve releases for VR. Valve has a complete interest in using it to promote its VR api, there would be no commercial reason at all for them to publish it in any other way than SteamVR as long as it is compatible with every VR headset as it is (even with the performance compromises we all know).

I don't see any reason on why I should justify myself about it to you, but I have some free time so I decided to play your stupid ""bigger penis"" game.

Second, your in depth explanation, although technically partially accurate, is completely unrelated to the issue here. The Rift is not unusable in SteamVR as you describe. you don't need any nasa hardware, you just get some ""slight"" performance decrease, which is something Valve has some interest in fixing in the future (if at least oculus keeps supporting its hardware, which it is doing in a very poor manner). So from a commercial point of view, they have some ""minor"" performances to fix and a big game release. Why would you invest money to make your game compatible with third party APIs instead of using the same money to fix your performance issue and push your own API even more on the market? Of course this is purely theoretical, as they can actually push their API without investing any money in fixing performances on a different hardware, but that is supposing Valve is evil, and that is false until proven otherwise by facts and I personally can't prove or disprove it, so ""innocent until proven"" still stands.",oculus
"I would debate that lone echo is a AAA title. But yes, I see what you mean, there are some AA titles but almost none would be considered AAA by flat gaming standards.",oculus
"the steam page says its April 2020,  valve time is kicking in already.",oculus
"I get ya. I'm just having a blast with Asgard. I love the theme, visuals, and there are a number of great moments since it was built for VR from the ground up.  Yeah, combat isn't exactly sophisticated, but the game flows nicely. Skyrim will always be legendary. I have to get back to that come to think of it.",oculus
Its a prequel so any Aperature stuff isn't going to be tech-related but rather lip service at best.,oculus
HL Source 2.,oculus
"You're right. I'd have to say that Pokemon has absolutely nothing on Half-Life... We're talking about a franchise for kids with gameboys vs. the big daddy of PC Gaming. 

There simply is no bigger franchise than Half-Life that would boost VR interest.",oculus
It already kicked in. They said in early 2017 that they were going to talk about their 3 VR games later in that year. It took over two years to get around to just talking about *one* of them. In another 2+ years they’ll announce they cancelled the other two and just make another HLVR title and maybe make it Episode 3 when much more advanced BR kits are out,oculus
"&gt;Further, I'll have an easier time updating to VR 3.0 in a few years if I'm not $1,000 in the hole.

Flip this reasoning around and it's exactly why I personally went with the Index as my first set of VR hardware.

I strongly believe in the modularity and upgradeability of the SteamVR ecosystem.

Let's say there comes a new type of controller that's way better than all others in some way in a few years. I won't have to buy an entire new kit to use it. Instead, I can just swap out the controllers.

Same goes for the HMD.

I'll likely never have to buy new base stations unless they get damaged somehow.

Since SteamVR has really [nice hardware licensing](https://partner.steamgames.com/vrlicensing) I strongly believe that's the platform other companies will make hardware for in the future.",oculus
Do you care about playing wireless Quest games? If not - get Rift S. Its simple as that.,oculus
"Damn Portal fans get everything, don't you games, spin-offs, lip service from the company, etc? The Lab exists and even Geoff interview, Valve thought The Lab WAS the BIG VR game for them.",oculus
"The upgrades can cost almost nothing to around $100 depending on how far you need to go for confort.  How far really depends on your head shape so you can't know until you try.

You'll probably also want a battery pack to extend the length of time you can play.  With a cable attached to a pcvr, power will be from the pc itself so the battery isn't needed but when you are using the headset wirelessly, it'll only last 2 hours unless you get a battery pack.

Meanwhile, I'm not sure if rift S will have a sale even in europe.",oculus
"It's not that much money anymore, and it's far from just one game. 

This is what will get people to want VR, and actually bother looking into it - and they'll discover that it costs like half as much as it did a few years ago and has several compelling full size games now.",oculus
"Not happening.

No one's jumping in for a half life vr game. Especially since VR games, including supposed AAA releases, all end up being completely over hyped, and stripped versions of standard AAA games.",oculus
Have they fixed aiming down sights?  I remember when it was released you couldn't use anything with a scope.  In assume that has to have changed by now?,oculus
"I bet thousands of people get into VR for HL, it is exactly the kind of game to get big traction in the wider gamin community.",oculus
Gotta look into it. if it's worth upgrading and so on :),oculus
"Best is probably Index. For your pricepoint, Quest with a few comfort mods.",oculus
Natural selection at work,oculus
"&gt;Splinter Cell VR and Assassin's Creed VR are in the works for Oculus
 
 
Worth noting, that this has not been confirmed and is based on rumour and conjecture only, at present.  Facebook has refused to confirm too, over the last 6 months.  Esp. notable is their lack of any mention at OC6 of making a deal for either Splinter Cell or Assassin's Creed for VR, when we expected something to be announced.",oculus
"Second that. Small environments. No arms, no body. No locomotion in the trailer. Not even vehicles. No climbing. Primitive mini-games. All the environments look like copy&amp;pasted straight out of Half Life 2.

This felt way too close to those overdone shooting galleries we had so many of, just with slightly better graphics.",oculus

The rift S is a solid HMD,oculus
"Yes that adapter works, as does the Kiwibird brand one.  The most important question is what laptop do you have? Specs?",oculus
"I agree. But it will be people looking into it rather than this game that will make our break that decision. $400 is a lot for ""one game"", and it will be advertised with a $1000 headset. 

What is holding vr back won't be fixed by one title
 It'll be fixed by education. We already have done truly awesome games.",oculus
Holy shit it’s already in my library ahhhhh,oculus
We know it's not just one game. Gamers who aren't interested in the VR medium don't. A lot of them think it's still just a bunch of short tech demos and that VR is a gimmick. If nothing else at least people are taking notice of Half Life and they might have a more serious look into what VR gaming has to offer.,oculus
There has not been one single let alone multiple AAA VR games developed until HL:A. It’s the first.,oculus
"According to a recent UploadVR article, it's partial support for Touch controllers - there are certain interactions that Alyx can only do with Knuckles.  Though, I personally can't see why these shouldn't be remappable to other controllers with the new SteamVR input system, but that's what the article says.",oculus
"Garry Newman actually is working on Rust at facepunch studio, and he said about the new half life "" Alyx is the worst thing in the half life universe change my mind """,oculus
Do we need to be on the same Oculus account on PC and Quest in order to use Oculus Link?,oculus
The grabbity glove mechanic comes from the gravity gun from HL2. It’s a mechanic that Valve did years before VR reboot.,oculus
"Not likely at all!

They discussed Portal VR in the [The Final Hours of Half-Life: Alyx video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9K0eJEmMEw).

Valve said that Portal was one of the IP's they experimented with for a VR game, but scrapped the idea...",oculus
If only.,oculus
They could definitely release something in the universe later though. If HLA is successful it probably will spawn a few more projects from Valve as there seems to be a lot of tech they can build on top of.,oculus
"Iron sights always worked for me.

They did 'fix' scopes in a way. It brings up a black  screen that shows the scopes image. Kinda sucks but it's a limitation of VR",oculus
"SteamVR's Home(formerly Destinations) already comes with Hammer using an offshoot of Source with VR support - you can access it from the SteamVR menu-&gt;Workshop-&gt;Create/Modify an Environment.  It supports scripting with Lua, etc.
 
 
Hopefully, it'll be upgraded even more with the HL:A additions and some aspects made more user friendly.",oculus
I tend to try to do the same movements like press up against wall when looking around the end of the wall.  Curious on how you think it’s unrealistic.,oculus
Valve really wants to have the option for teleport locomotion though. That's not really possible in a Portal-like game.,oculus
From NZ and purchased via the Oculus store. Can confirm there were no GST or import duties payable - all covered in purchase price.,oculus
It doesn't have to have the Portal mechanic at all though. The universe and setting are open enough that you can do pretty much anything and it will still have the same feeling of a Portal game.,oculus
I think the Portal *gameplay* is very important to being a Portal game.,oculus
"&gt;Some of their answers were extremely frustrating to hear as someone who is a fan of valve games. They've been making and shelving game projects over the last ten years to help grow their source engine? Umm... excuse me what? None of these games seemed worth taking to market?

Lots of studios do this. Some games with many millions budget have been shelved. Nothing new.",oculus
"I didn't say Portal game though, I say Portal universe. And Portal 2 almost didn't have portals, they were gonna use a new mechanic called f-stop. The Portal gun is one of any Aperture technologies, there's a lot more they can do with the setting.",oculus
"Yeah, but OP is specially talking about a Portal VR game. Watering this down to a ""game in the Portal universe"" doesn't make sense when discussing OPs question imo.",oculus
"Plus, they did say that there are a larger number of things that just play better because of the design of Knuckles - due to their tight development together with the game.",oculus
"&gt;They could definitely release something in the universe later though.

Totally. I would love to see what they could do with that ratman character in VR even if short episodic content.",oculus
"I absolutely love it. Best display I've seen - super sharp, lightweight, quite comfortable, ridiculously easy to set up (as long as you have a miniDisplayPort. My old Rift's display looked out of focus in comparison.",oculus

"You wanna help people? Order up 100,000 Rift CV1 replacement cables.",oculus
"It does because as I said, you can still get a  game that feels like Portal without having to have the Portal gun as your main mechanic. A huge draw of the series is the humor, charm, atmosphere, Puzzle solving, lore, etc. In fact I think a new puzzle mechanic that fully takes advantage of VR as a medium would be more interesting than Portals again, even if they figured out how  to implement them.",oculus
is there a link?,oculus
"Pokemon Sword and Shield is fastest selling Switch game ever. It might not have the link to PC gaming, but it is an extremely popular franchise which would work really well in VR.",oculus

"Cool. Have fun being another parrot fanboy. So now there's like 3 of you guys now out of 191,620 subscribers. Oh wow",oculus
That guy on the right (Alex?) says so much bullshit. He says he played Half Life 1 and now complains about needing to buy a USD 300 headset to play Half Life like never before. Back in HL1 days a PC that ran HL1 costed more tan a VR PC+VR headset today. He would know that if he played HL1. So WTF?,oculus
Buy it again,oculus

"Yeah no doubt, but it's still crazy to see a VR game #1 on trending.",oculus
"At least it makes scopes usable I guess, and that's the main thing, because it was nearly unplayable before this change. I might have to revisit this game now.",oculus
I wonder how it will affect motion sickness.,oculus
"Quest. As a Go user, you have experienced wire-free VR so a wired-only headset would be annoying.",oculus
"Amazing!

So much good news out of this, it keeps on giving!",oculus
"I *think* that you'd be ok but I couldn't guarantee, a 1050 should be fine the issue will be the RAM, is there any way you can get 16gb instead?",oculus
"I have not seen the video, but played HL1 like 20 years and i can say that it was possible to turn the graphics quality into crap and play it on a crappy machine.
But no one would do this today, everyone needs best quality.",oculus
"Plus with how hyped Half Life is, they needed the opportunity to make it a revolutionary game like HL2 was for physics etc. and VR gives that opportunity.",oculus
"Yes, they should have, 100%.

What the unofficial team is doing right now with HL2, Valve should have done and it would have taken a small team there to do in a year, max.

We should have had HL1 and HL2 in VR.

It was early days and locomotion wasn't figured out yet, and back then Valve said they were all about teleport and not smooth, so maybe in that sense it would have been too early though.",oculus
"Wait for refund to go though, then buy again.",oculus
Yeah and it seems to be below 500 euros. I just might sell my rift and get S instead!,oculus
It is designed as a seated experience.,oculus
"I been trying to sell mine for 200 and I've seen others about the same, good luck.",oculus
"Link cable charges quest, the battery slowly drains overall, but I would guess you would be good for at least 10 hours before the battery becomes an issue, and you are very unlikely to use VR that long.",oculus
"Yes, this is absolutely going to bring a *lot* of people into VR.

There's just no other way around it. 

This is the tipping point where VR starts to go mainstream. This will be the catalyst. 

We have medal of honor too around the same time. Two big names, and half life being one of the biggest launches in the history of gaming.....it's looking good.

Then we have a growing catalogue of high quality games, asgard wrath, storm land, etc. 

Valve has 2 more games that have been confirmed in production. One will likely be launched end of next year.

Overall, I think HLA will be a catalyst that will move VR I to the mainstream. 

As a strict supporter of high end VR, I'm glad there are cheap options out there like Rift S that still provides a good experience that price-wise enables newcomers to jump in without having to make a more difficult expensive decision.",oculus
"For me it's that my arms are never the right length, either the in-game arms are slightly bent even though I'm stretching in real life, or they bug out because the in-game arms are too short and my actual hand position is different to where the in-game arms are.",oculus
So you prioritise releasing a broken game on a specified day rather than releasing a working game a bit later?,oculus
So they improved the AI in this 2 months :),oculus
This looks amazing! Definitely the VR game I've been waiting for. Can't wait.,oculus
"&gt;I'm not paying $400/600/1000 just to play one game

"They won't just care about this one user. But they will target many users like me. Recently, facebook, Twitter, and youtube have banned a large number of accounts supporting China. This is a news that you can search for.
You are not afraid because you are not Snowden, not Assange.
You are not afraid because you are not Snowden, not Assange. Because the voice of the world is in the US media and websites, they can start the rebellion in Egypt, Yemen, Syria, Libya, and Ukraine, let their economy plummet, be surrounded by war, and civilians die because of the war brought about by ""freedom and democracy."" . Then they can do it in China. So China needs to avoid these problems.
The United States only needs to master the mainstream voice, but if they encounter serious threats to American public opinion, they will try to make them disappear, such as Snowden and Assange.",oculus
"Let them whine, it's OK.

There is more positivity than negativity from what I've seen anyway. 

Ultimately, they can whinge all they want in their ignorance, but once it launches and people play it, their turn will start to change as they hear how good it is. 

Then when they try it, a whole new world will open up for them. 

I can't imagine what it would be like for one of these guys who has either never tried VR or has only tried google cardboard, and then plays HLA on an Index lol.

Good times ahead!",oculus
"&gt; One of the complaints against VR has always been the supposed lack of AAA titles; while I don't agree with that mentality and think that both PCVR and PSVR have already gotten AAA quality material, an original entry in a highly regarded series like this is something people will have a much harder time writing off.

I think what VR gaming still lacks is a platform-defining game. I'd say the closest we've come is something like Beat Saber, but that mainly serves the more 'casual' side of the audience. Oculus is on the right path with games like Stormland, Lone Echo and Asgard's Wrath but none of them are true stand-outs just yet, usually because they're still quite limited in scope or because they don't push the boundary all that much except for production value.

Valve's entire portfolio is stacked with critically acclaimed titles so it's hard not to get excited about their take on VR. I just hope the failure of Artifact wasn't a sign...",oculus
"This also enables occlusion-free, very precise hand tracking.",oculus
"I haven't seen anything about this game that actually brings something new to the table. It has more polish than your average indie game, but polish aside the trailer really didn't look much different than your average shooting gallery. The small environments and lack of locomotion in the trailer is also worrisome.

But with Valve not even offering an affordable headset, all of that is a bit pointless anyway. You are not selling many $1000 headsets no matter how good the game is. Most of the cheap WMRs will be out-of-stock when the game is actually done. So this just drives more people to Quest and Rift S.",oculus

Are you recording this video in the afterlife?,oculus
Do a search. This is asked every day.,oculus
Get the quest you stupid idiot bitch,oculus
The ducks nuts.,oculus
Oo,oculus
That seems insanely resource intensive.,oculus
Seriously you won’t notice the difference. And the quest works better in terms of cable management unless you have a designated VR room with a cable hanging from the fucking ceiling. Also when you’re playing on Quest you can also play Steam VR using Oculus Link but you only need to do so for Steam exclusive games. Fuck this fuck you.,oculus
Bruh tell me this. Which will be better: a gaming pc or a phone processor,oculus
Ah I've been using it all day with unity and oculus sdk. No issues over here. Rift S tho,oculus
A gaming PC. Which you can use on the oculus Quest. A Quest is literally a rift but it can disconnect from PC.,oculus
You might have to specify your question further if you’re looking for a worthwhile answer,oculus
"If you're new to VR, you may want to consider a Quest instead of a Rift S. Oculus is beta testing Oculus Link software right now and will be releasing a cable later on. That way you get the best of both worlds with complete portability and only slightly lower quality for PCVR titles on the Quest than the Rift S.

Disadvantages of the Quest is the weight of it for comfort, and the headstrap design (IMO). But aside from that, it's fantastic.",oculus
What?,oculus
"Steam VR (as well as the Steam app itself is a buggy pile of shit).

Oculus Home is flawless for me.",oculus
"Look man. I’m primarily gonna buy my games on the steam store aight. Even beat saber. I have no need for portability because I HAVE NO FRIENDS TO PLAY IT WITH😂😭😭😭. I’m gonna be using it at home, so I might aswell buy the rift s for the Black Friday discounted price and not buy another cable on top of that just to play VR",oculus
"No multiplayer, but H3VR is one of the absolute best shooter games in VR. Tons of content and the game is updated with new content on a constant basis. https://store.steampowered.com/app/450540/Hot_Dogs_Horseshoes__Hand_Grenades/",oculus

"&gt; will be way faster, use less power and cost less than ... series now.

This applies to literally every generation of nVidia GPUs.

 RTX is faster, cheaper and more power efficient than 10xx series, and 4xxx will be faster/cheaper/efficient compared to 3xxx. . There's no point in waiting for some hypothetical supreme jump in quality, because it will never happen. GPUs generations scale/evolve almost linearly, always have.",oculus
"The thing to remember is this is a beta. It will almost certainly improve over time. As far as betas go, I'm genuinely impressed.",oculus
"I don’t have any friends to play it with either but I can take my quest downstairs to the basement where I have a large area so I can play it. My PC room is very busy and there’s no room to walk. But if I can take it anywhere tetherless, there are no limits. I can take it anywhere. At night I can take it to a big empty field and play without boundaries, literally. So I don’t know, is your PC room big enough for VR? If it is, fuck it, get a Rift S, whatever. But I don’t think it is.",oculus
"the term would be crossplay, meaning u can play among multiple platforms. crossbuy means u can buy it on rift s and get it on quest for free, or vice versa. 

to answer ur question: look up “crossplay games” in this sub.",oculus
Damn you are right. But still I will feel like I’m wasting power since I have a really good pc and I’m not utilizing it’s full potential,oculus
"Yeah, I've been looking at the Quest for a long while, but decided on the Rift S.

Mobility doesn't really do anything for me, because I rarely leave the house, and if I get the Link, then you're back to using a cable playing VR, which kills mobility.

IPD shouldn't be a problem for me.

The Quest being front heavy, and having to rely on battery life to play, is a issue to me. Because I don't trust batteries lifespans that much, and if the battery dies, you can't replace it, so you're screwed.

While the Rift S is suppose to be comfortable, and you shouldn't have trouble playing for hours on end.

I'm planning to buy the video card, whether I buy a VR headset or not.

Also, $350 for the Rift S on Black Friday is a Plus.

Though I'm wondering if a 2070 Super would be futureproof enough to work with the next gen headset, or should I just get a lower card like the 1660 Super, and wait till the new headsets, and that's if the 1660 Super can play everything just fine.",oculus
Except you WILL be utilizing its full potential with the power of Oculus Link®️,oculus
Oh no what have you done. Oh no oh no oh no,oculus
"They function as a seperate screen, basically. Your GPU renders two 3D images and sends them over the display port cable to the screen in the headset. Your question is a bit vague though so if theres anything specific lemme know.",oculus
Search for usb3.1 crimping set. It's not super expensive. Maybe a euro or two per head.,oculus
"This is the first I've heard of Primal Ritual but it looks great. 

How long on average does it take to complete the game?",oculus
"The question is a little bit broad, but you plug it into your graphics cards display port and into a USB port, download the Oculus software and steam VR if you want to play steam games and you're set. You'll want a graphics card like a GTX1050ti or higher for the games and at least a modern CPU.

Alternatively in the Rift S case it uses some kind of 3D mapping of your room/ play area to track the headset with it's cameras and then also uses the headsets cameras to track the controllers via IR lights emitted from them that flash at different frequencies. 

If you do get a Rift S and your specs are up to par but you find that you loose tracking completely sometimes or get static/ snow looking stuff on your screen this can be fixed by purchasing and installing a USB expansion card in your pc, the recommended ones are basically anything with a Fresco L1100 chipset like this one: [https://www.amazon.com.au/Inateck-Superspeed-Ports-PCI-Expansion/dp/B00B6ZCNGM](https://www.amazon.com.au/Inateck-Superspeed-Ports-PCI-Expansion/dp/B00B6ZCNGM)",oculus
"&gt;how do pc based headsets work

Doesn’t really go into detail about what exactly it is you want to know. 

Are you wondering about the PC side of it? The different connections? The display? How the tracking system works? What controllers they use? How to buy games? 

There’s tons of things someone can tell you about pc headsets. Do you want to know something in specific or are you looking for a general explanation of how VR works from A through Z?",oculus
What do you do if you dont meet the minimum requirements for a rift s? Will it not work?,oculus
does it charge while in use?,oculus
Definitely this.  Just wasted a bunch of hours on ultimately just unplugging the Quest...,oculus
"Umm it sorta depends on how far below them you are, you could possibly run it on an older graphics card and CPU the games will just be low framerate or jittery, which is a big no if you can avoid it as this will likely give you motion sickness. But depending on your specs it's entirely possible that it wont work. Do you know what your specs are?",oculus
My specs dont meet the minimum requirements for the rift s :(,oculus
"All fair points :) Sounds like you've done your homework. I'm not sure if you should go the 2070 Super or the 1660 Super honestly. I would have said ""go the 2070"" easily before, but they've already teased the next generation of GPUs, and with a new gaming console launch cycle next year, there's likely to be a pretty significant leap forward.

I ended up buying a gaming laptop recently with a RTX 2060 in it and while it was a monumental upgrade from my previous card (GTX 970), it still runs at a crawl with ray tracing on. I anticipate that the next generation of GPUs will handle ray tracing MUCH better than the 20xx range, as it's a major feature of next gen consoles.

In terms of HMD, If you actually have a friend with a Quest though - I'd still recommend giving it a shot (especially if you can borrow it to test on your environemtn).

With the tethered vs. tetherless issue, there is actually a way to play PCVR games wirelessly using VirtualDesktop/ALVR/Riftcat. You do need a good 5ghz AP that is near to your play area, but it works pretty well. The only part that's not great is that Oculus games have to run through Revive, which adds some latency on top of the latency that already gets added for being wireless. So basically native SteamVR games run near flawlessly, but games through the Oculus store are noticably choppy/laggy.",oculus
"It would be best to look into upgrading your pc then before purchasing a headset, if you do want to get into VR and can't upgrade your pc right now you can get an Oculus Quest, This can play some VR games without a pc, and there's a cable that lets you use it with a pc later after you upgrade. The games on Quest are separate from the PC games but quite a few of the PC games can be found on the Quests store like Beat Saber, Super Hot and a few others.",oculus
"Hi there,    
When you are downloading the app, are you using a Windows profile with administrative access to your PC?

Can you play steam vr games on the Quest. I want to use google earth vr,oculus
"Yes. And, due to the video encoding, you probably need a slightly better computer to get the exact same performance, as you will be rendering the game, then encoding/compressing it to send to the headset.

"Sure, but the guy was running it on a low spec card that isn't officially supported and it seems fine in Beat Saber. I'm sure better GPUs would give better results in more demanding games.",oculus
This makes me sad as all I have is the rift,oculus
Your laptop is overheating ? When was the last time you cleaned out your fans ?,oculus
"This is why I'm so skeptical to buy it.  It's a singleplayer-centric game, yet it has some weird games-as-a-service type implementation...Except for the fact that they haven't even given any roadmap or anything for the game, and combined with being bought by Sony, I'm not very hopeful for it.

I'd honestly prefer if it was just a one-and-done game and I could play all the content at once, even if it meant no more was coming in the future (Which it very well might not anyway).  The whole reset thing and having to play the game again every week with a slightly different layout, while also not having additional content promised just really turns me off from it.",oculus
"Right now they have a beta up for the Oculus Link, this lets you use the Quest with Steam and Oculus PC games using a usb-c cable. It's only in beta right now but it will be fully launching in the next few months likely. But yes this will allow you to use the Quest with any PC VR games like steam ones and Oculus ones as long as your computer can handle it. I'm not sure how performance hungry Google earth is but it might work without upgrading or it might not.",oculus
Damn. I was hoping to get away with something like this. https://www.newegg.com/p/1TS-001A-01218. I can't find any laptops with a 1060TI. Any idea what the cheapest laptop card is?,oculus
"That laptop will work, but you will be sitting right at the min spec. You will be paying 1.5 to 2x the cost in a laptop for the same performance profile as a desktop.

"That's interesting and further proof how everyone is different. I found the CV1, Rift S and PlayStation VR to be the most comfortable 3 headsets I've used since the days of DK1.

As much as I love the Quest, I just can't get it to sit right without me constantly fiddling with it. I've tried every variation and recommendation based off suggestions and videos. It just feels like it's either being held up by my nose, or the bottom of my eyes (anyone see Clockwork Orange?) after 15-20 minutes. 

I'm dying for a solution. The comfort strap has become harder to find unless you want to pay double than what it was. I would love to spend more time in the Quest.

It's tough enough to play a shooter streamed off your own computer with only 50-75ms latency added.

"The nice thing about hitting min spec for VR is it also happens to pretty much coincide with the hardware you would use for 1440p. So you wouldn't be building a PC for VR exclusively, you would be building it for gaming.

So basically anyone not interested in 4K gaming yet is likely already at that level of hardware, if they have recently bought a PC. Because you can have something that was midrange 5 years ago and still run new games at 1080p.

And if you have a computer that can do 4k gaming, you have a very capable VR machine already. Which again, is getting surprisingly accessible. That can be had for under $1000 USD already. But again that's if the game launches soon. The main thing is, the bar for entry into VR hasn't moved, Oculus deliberately made their new PC headset target the exact same hardware as the last one. And the games are already made to that spec too. So that will have been 6 years straight by the time the Rift S is replaced that the entry level VR system was held still. We still have 2 and a half years of that time now. So when you hold the requirements still for that long, the price comes down dramatically.",oculus

In a very generalizing manner to describe the viewing experience of the Quest+Link would be like a CV1 with the same vibrant colors, slightly more defined edges and slightly increased FOV the enough to feel like not looking thru a ski-google, but slightly more ghosting when doing super fast motions. However, Rift S still have that clarity jump that I feel I would much prefer to have. Besides, as amazing as untethered VR can be, at the end of the day I'm using using VR main in my four walls, so the Quest being portable and can do VR anywhere really is not a deciding factor to me.

They can transform a sparse pixel view to a full one in realtime for use in VR and AR. They show it using 5-10% of the pixels initially and the results are just amazing.
What I want to know is what do they use to run it? At what resolution and framerate?

I'm reading the paper but haven't finished it yet. It looks like a simple UNet model so I guess the important part is the loss functions, notably the visual flow loss that should avoid flickering.

We might see a Quest 2 sometime in the next years that would be able to render 4K per eye at PC quality but it's not even the most exiting thing IMO.
We could render games on PC in a quality way above current AAA games (think photorealism), stream it wirelessly (as it would take 90% less bandwidth) and fill the gaps on the headset itself with an ASIC chip.

"If true, it could be due to a number of reasons. 

Steam actually has a lot of Chinese gamers now, which means they likely bring in quite a chunk of change.

There are a significant number of players in the PC version of Destiny 2 that are Chinese now (its a Steam game now).

So, it's possible they don't want to step on any toes. I mean, just recently both Activision-Blizzard and the NBA were under fire for bowing down to Chinese influence, particularly in a way that had an affected things outside of China.

It's also possible that Valve just doesn't want something so political on their platform at the moment, since it isn't as satirical as other content that has been allowed.

There are a number of weird content rules on many platforms as of late, because of the cureent political climate. Facebook is in the news everyday getting heat for some of their decisions on political ads and such, Twitter a bit less so, YouTube has been under fire from content creators, viewers, and politicians for a number of their curation practices.

idk though and it's not really the point of the experience either, which is to draw more attention to the massive protests, the human rights abuses (indiscriminate arrests, beatings, torture, rape, etc. by HK law enforcement and other actors on behalf of the CCP), as well as other elements of the situation in HK.",oculus

"&gt; You won't be getting 5 gig on a crappy 5m usb 3 cable, extensions also have an adverse effect, the plugs them self are not good for signal quality.

I'm aware that shielding, twisting and kinks affect cabling. Also what affects USB 3/ USB-C cabling is whether or not is has the required circuitry and resistors in it to properly negotiate the connection and capability of it.

This is partly why most cables you buy will either work or not work, but if you have a cable which is various metals other than gold, you're probably not going to see much of a difference in using a gold cable.

Either way I believe we're both in agreement that cables for USB vary far too much, they need to be held to a standard, like cat5/5e/6 cabling is for networking, with statements as to whether or not its shielded, or twisted, etc. Then we'd be able to make a better choice.

"I'd suggest going to youtube and searching for American Truck sim vr, then following the instructions.  It's basically a couple of tweaks in steam, then a couple of changes to a config file, then changing some in-game gfx settings.  Let me know if you get stuck.  Oh and enjoy! :-)",oculus

"its definitely not refresh rate, the only reason they dont want refresh rate to be low is because of being able to perceive the flickering

"Only reduced the HMD Quality so same as with the CV1 or any other HMD - more aliasing. Only did this to see what it takes to get the 72Hz, 1.5-&gt;1.0 was the first step and that worked. This is inside a station as well, notoriously difficult to get high FPS there even with powerful hardware.

Noticed a weird thing with SteamVR though - it set the render resolution to 1808x200 per eye as the baseline so with 100% setting. I found that a bit high, though the base is 1344x1600 as with the Rift S. Need to check a bit more what's going on.",oculus
Nope. I didn't even pay attention to those numbers.,oculus
"You don’t need good close vision for VR at all. If you need glasses to read a book but don’t need them to see the TV, then you won’t need glasses for VR. That said, even if you need glasses you can wear them in the headset.",oculus

Personally no (not needed) but have heard nothing but good about them from people who have used them.,oculus
Thats my setup. My cable is sitting in a drawer if i should ever need it. I have no plans to upgrade until there are wireless options for the new devices,oculus

"Not having spent as much time with Link. The resolution bump is really nice. And setup is much smoother. 
What the CV 1 has going for it is better tracking, better sound and better Comfort.

"Adorable conspiracy in the first sentence, court backed reality in the second?

If I'm close to an object like for reading I see this object at 6 feet . How does this work ?,oculus
Yeah links please,oculus
"&gt; Do you think you will be able to buy spare parts for that in 3.5 years?

The issue is not really related to when the headset was launched (3.5 years ago) it is when the last headset was sold. I feel bad for people that bought their headsets in March 2019. They will get warranty support then thats it. Game over. No spares.

That doesn't even take into account people who bought a CV1 in march and have a cable failure due to no fault of Oculus. ie pet chewing the cable. Oculus should not be expected to replace it free but your average consumer would definitely expect to be able to replace a consumable part.

The right thing to do would be support your customers for 12-24 months after the sale of the last headset.",oculus

"There are different kinds of USB cables and in those different kinds there is different qualities and different components. I used to think this too but having a CV1 with 3 sensors with extensions and whatnot- it is way more complicated than that. Also signal degrades over length. Many USB cables are good for file transfers but the low latency of VR has different demands. There are different grades of HDMI cables too. HDMI 1.0, 1.2, 2.0.",oculus
"The SteamVR comment had nothing to do with ED, just brought it up because there was talk about quality and render resolutions. I am playing ED with native Rift support.",oculus
"It doesn't have OculusSDK, I was running it via OpenComposite.

I'll check on DCS, that has native support, there I don't have the frame Counter activated by default, but I had the same impresion.

Those two games I have almost always ASW on my CV1, because they are ressource hungry and my computer can't achieve 90FPS",oculus
There's nothing to watch. There's maybe a press embargo and we'll probably see a trailer at that time.,oculus

"No, it's not SteamVR related. Even with the CV1 natively the FPS drops to 45 in stations because of the quality settings I'm using, but I'm OK with that, not doing anything snappy in there just landing and taking off. Of course with Link it drops down to 36.",oculus
"nope. got my cv1 second hand for a great deal. when it will die i will first try to repair it myself/locally and if it wont work i will upgrade to a rift S or hopefully to gen2 vr by then.

as much as i dont like the oculus ecosystem, there are no real alternatives currently.

and i still have not given up hope on the cv1. i am sure oculus will work it out or we will get an OEM solution at some point.

the cv1 is 3 years old. not nearly enough to stop manufacturing replacement cables for it. its a lot of money and even apple are still selling 30 pin cables on their official website, cause why not?",oculus
I sent in a ticket. Hopefully it goes through!,oculus
Latency and image clarity,oculus
"I wanted an Index but it's not available here and it's a bit pricy for what you get to be honest.

If I stop playing the Oculus exclusives I might be willing to move to Valve at a later point if price and availability changes.",oculus

And then waaaamy..... It wasn't.,oculus
"I have the same problem, besides the only problem that I complain about in Rift S. So far support has failed to solve. They offered to exchange the Rift S but I'm not interested, could still get a drive that had other issues :).

I am convinced that this is something related to the software and hope that they will find a solution. However I am using an external mic connected to the PC via USB.",oculus
"It might get better with optimizations. I see some people with 2080Ti struggling as well on high settings, so it's not just about raw power.",oculus
"&gt;  That and the fact that oculus wont let me reset my view no matter what ( especially in beat saber). 

You can reset your position by opening dash, and on the panel showing your current game click ""Reset View"", does that work for you?",oculus
"""You're""",oculus
"No, sadly it doesn't. I've used that and the one in the menu near the clock in dash. I've also opened the app facing the way I'd like and started playing a song in the position I'd prefer. No luck. Sometimes it works the next day and then stops working when it reset the app.",oculus

Fail.,oculus
"It's a tricky one because Steam VR may be rendering well, but then there's the whole Link part, so it's hard to tell if the extra resources being used by Steam VR are slowing down Link. Link seems to take a big toll on the older PC which has a 4770k that I tested it with and stutters a fair bit compared to just running the Rift or Rift S. Anyway, I'm just throwing speculations out there and am probably not really helping.",oculus
I wish I could update my bios but I’ve been trying to look at tutorials and I still have no idea. How’d you do it?,oculus
No,oculus
"I'm glad it's coming out too.  Always happy for hopefully good games.  The biggest problem is actually their timing.  I just bought asgards wrath.  Stormland is out.  Boneworks is coming soon.  I still want the secret lives of pets.  Borderlands 2.

There's just so many games to buy now.  Where if they had been on time, there wouldn't have been.",oculus
"Neither Oculus, Valve or HTC sells officially to Brazil, here to get the Oculus Quest for example, you would need to pay around 860 US dollars or more on the grey market to get it, without warranty. Only the Windows MR headsets are sold officialy here with warranty, you can get one starting at 650 US dollars.

That is not cheap, specially after taking in account that the mean monthly income of the country is low (the mean is around 560 US dollars, the legal minimum is half that). 

I am an engineer and work for a big auto manufacturer, I have several co workers who play virtual racing together, all engineers, they all know about VR and have experienced it (we have both rift and vive on the office) and are allways talking about how much better racing would be with the headset, but to this day only two of us got a headset, one got the Rift when he was traveling to the US and I got the Acer one here on Brazil. They all say the same, its very cool but still very expensive. And as I said that is comming for engineers who are paid more than the mean of the country.

So I can see how some people may became frustrated, they waited all this time for a new game of a beloved franchise and when it appears it needs a device that they cant get.",oculus
"That's fine, I just want to get out there that I am 99 percent sure there's some sort of issue with how steamvr and the oculus software interact. My computer is definitely powerful enough to run both, and using ALVR and VD steamvr runs perfectly.",oculus

It says nothing about quest?!,oculus
"You're not wrong, but you make a really good observation that idk if you're even catching up on... Look how much VR has grown, to where we're finally using the sentences like ""there's too many games, I can't buy them all"" or similar sentences.

If you make beat saber open in oculus/other vr mode in steam (right click) does that resolve any problems?,oculus

"Rift S is basically a more comfortable headset, but if you're not bothered by it, then stick with Quest.

As for screen difference, go to Youtube, and play a 720p video, and then switch to 1080p video, can you tell the difference and does it bother you?  If you can't tell the difference, then don't bother buying Rift S

Also the benefit of Quest is also library, you get access to both Oculus mobile and Oculus Rift library(with Link), so all those mobile apps like Netflix VR, Youtube VR, Amazon Prime VR, Watch Live 360 sports, mobile games can only be played on Quest.",oculus

I was wondering about that. I bought some ceiling things sometime back but have never set them up since I didn't really want the rift cable hanging in the middle of the room 24/7, and was thinking it might be more of a pain to hang up and take down each time I wanted to play that any gains from getting it off the floor. So the kit is still in the box never been used.",oculus
It should still have the logs on your PC though,oculus
"Yep, I'm in the PC, so my whole setup cost me $420. Lenovo Explorer, GTX 1060 6 gb, Optiplex 3010, all used.",oculus

"OhShape, how do I love thee, let me count the ways. :D I downloaded it from Viveport and gave it a go this weekend. After one session, it's definitely one of my favorite workout games, and as soon as it goes on sale at Oculus, will be buying it there. Already left a review over at Viveport for it, and it's rare that I take the time to review a game. (Naturally I had to mention that ""fonts matter"", don't know which one they're using on their title screens, but the ""t"" looks a LOT like a ""c"", so that song top row far right really looks a lot like ""Crap Is"" instead of ""Trap Is"". And now that I've seen it, I cannot UNsee it. 😀 )

But you're playing Med and Hard? Color me impressed. I felt pretty good that I got through all the easy and medium levels (although glad that they added that no fail option now, I'd never get through a song on Medium without it). Here's one song I recorded doing easy and medium. Medium definitely needs work, had a LOT of ""YOU MISSED!"" red walls light up.

Jedi: Rising Order,oculus
"True, seems kinda unfair they get nominated twice, once for EA release and one for full release.

PSVR does have the biggest market though, and beat saber was pc only then. Quest looks to be catching up fast, and will pass soon, but only people with good pc could play Asgard’s on link, whereas again beat saber is a top title for popularity

I’m hopeful for you, just skeptical.

The work and quality of AW far surpasses beat saber, a great game to be sure though",oculus
"No reason to be sorry. You expressed an opinion, I expressed mine. It is all good. :)",oculus
"It's difficult to do an A/B comparison since the screen in a VR headset is inches from your eyes. Primarily for that reason, the resolution won't appear as good as a 1080p flat panel viewed from several feet away. VR headsets also don't have HDR, brightness or contrast controls or other video processing features you may take for granted on a traditional flat panel.

The other limitation you'll run into is the field of view. Unless you go really high end there is no escaping a certain degree of binocular style field of view when in the headset.

All that said, the resolution of the Rift S coupled with its 3x subpixel design means that it has a very crisp image. Even small text is easily legible and the screen door effect that plagued earlier headsets is all but gone. The sense of immersion in VR also really helps mitigate any drop in resolution or limits in FOV. For the price it yields a very satisfying VR experience.",oculus
"I was also disappointed they didn't bring the sequel to VR. I got the game free with my pre-ordered Rift. I wonder how many VR copies they sold after the freebie period. 

I also wonder how well a sequel would do on Quest. I keep hearing reports of developers making more in a few weeks on Quest than they made in years on the Rift store. There might still be hope for a Luckey's Tale 2 in VR.",oculus
"Yes thank you. The Touch Basics app helped a bit. 
At the beginning it shows the controllers. I can see that my left thumb stays stuck on the stick even though I removed it. I think it’s because it thinks I’m moving it to the left. It’s possible this problem has always been there - but the control scheme in Stormland has brought it to light.",oculus
Definitely the one thing I'm looking forward to with this new half life is hopefully the release of their source 2 sdk with vr support,oculus

"Well, they were one of the earliest adopters. Like many other early devs, they were going into uncharted territory with VR and they didn't have the benefits of hindsight. Today we have ""best practices"" that have been validated by real-world gameplay, Oculus Connect talks and developer post-mortems to start from. Back then all we had were the Oculus dev forums and some basic documentation.

"I own several headsets, (Vive, Vive Pro, Rift CV1, Rift S, HP Reverb, Oculus Quest and Odyssey +)

Clarity and comfort is different between them all. I never thought I'd like the halo design of the Rift S but it's by far the most comfortable of all the designs. I love the clarity of the HP Reverb which is really far and away the best visual experience, but I find myself using the Rift S most between all the headsets as I can wear it comfortably for the most time. 

Your milage may vary, however unless your primary goal is to play wireless experiences, I still recommend the Rift S for anyone who is more than a casual VR user. The Quest is amazing, I don't want to undersell the device, but just like everything out there depending on your use case, each headset can offer something different.

That's my opinion, take it for what it's worth.",oculus

PSVR and Rift S both use static IPD systems. You can only change the scale via software. I own both headsets,oculus

"What settings should I stick at for the most intensive VR games? And how loud would the fans get during a vr game? For context, in a game like Zombie army trilogy, and most games from 2015-2017 run very silently. Then ramps up in volume going from 2018 to 2019 games. Hitman 2 is an example of my fans going overdrive. With this in mind, how do vr games compare on this spectrum?",oculus

It's just irritating for the fans to be loud. It's made extra annoying with how it's a shared space and my family doesnt like the noise that games like the previously mentioned hitman 2 give my fans. I'd prefer to know this simply for my family,oculus
"i say watching a movie in theater is almost 720p.
and that is on an odessey, which is more resolution than rift S.

but still buy it..",oculus
"&gt; I haven't even experienced 4K VR, so I can't say for sure, but according to my math, you'd need 16K at least before the eye is physically unable to notice improvements.

There's 2 variables here, the amount of pixels per eye and the FOV. (and the Hz too, to a much lesser extent)

The true metric to use to determine screen clarity is pixels-per-degree (PPD), e.g. a 1000x1000 screen filling 100 degrees of your vision is 10 PPD.

And whether your eyes can see the difference then depends on what visual phenomena you are talking about.

But the TL;DR is along the lines of:

* ~35 PPD (e.g. 3850x3850 per eye with 120 FOV, 110 stereo-overlap) is the point the screen-door should properly completely disappear for people with remotely normal vision (i.e. average to above-average). Similar to how a 27"" 1080p screen looks at ""normal"" viewing distance (2 feet ish).

* ~50 PPD is the point at which clarity is very high and diminishing returns begin. Similar to how a 27"" 1440p screen looks at normal viewing distance, and this combination is currently considered very high clarity and 'premium' for gaming PCs.

* ~70 PPD is the point where hard diminishing returns begin. Similar to how a 28"" 4K screen looks at normal viewing distance. This size/resolution combo is normally seen as excessive/sub-optimal for PCs, as 4K at 28"" is very small without scaling options, and usually 32"" would be better overall, and then lower than 70 PPD.

* ~120 PPD is the point where only a very small % of people would be able to tell any difference, and only with certain visual phenomena. This is similar to holding a high res smartphone (e.g. Galaxy S10) about 12 inches away from you. Obviously in that scenario there's no way you'll see any artifacts in the S10's screen based on pixel count/PPD, 120 PPD is absurdly high.",oculus
"You can adjust your fan curves for that stuff, not sure what the best software for that is (it depends on your hardware brands) but if Hitman 2 is spinning them up, I would assume that VR will",oculus
"Palmer mentioned the PSVR *once* in his article. He says the PSVR has a wide enough sweetspot as a trade off for having the static IPD. He further justified the PSVR being adequate because it's only a $199 headset. 

Thus, I'm not seeing the issue ? With my 68mm IPD, the sweet spot on the Rift S is large enough for me. Same with the PSVR.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nothing is perfect, but .  It is possible to design optical systems with  a very wide sweet spot/eyebox and little need for physical adjustment,  but not without tradeoffs.  **Playstation VR** is a good modern example,  using solid and heavy lenses with a fairly long focal length to create  an wide enough eyebox for most users.  This comes with a penalty to  weight, cost, size and panel utilization (and thus resolution), but it  is hard to argue with the results, especially for a headset that  regularly sells for $199",oculus

"Did you not notice that the controllers don't feel as ""direct"" and kinda floaty and a bit weird? That's the main big thing I noticed using Link.

I’ve used my Quest in the woods before. Worked perfectly.,oculus
"The problem, though, is that even if you can build a PC exclusively for playing VR on minimum specs, why would you? If I'm going to invest in a good PC to run VR with ease and that is more future proof, going with the minimum requirements would mean you get a worse experience that will also be likely to become more obsolete faster. If you can afford to invest in such a device and VR, especially if you're thinking of developing for it or learning how to, you might as well go for something bigger. That means more time spent saving up money. Not exactly very accessible. I've got a future to consider like my family, a car, and paying off loans, for example, so I'm working on side stuff to help save up for a good PC to build. Even if I want it, it's out of my reach for now. I do have to agree that it does make this more exclusive (even though I love that it's being built for VR, even if I don't have the PC to run it yet), so the anger is also understandable. I hope it does push more people to save and invest in VR, though. More money in that market helps us push forward with better headsets, making them more affordable, etc.",oculus

You can even buy a full 6DoF VR experience for the same price as a game console, not even with a PC required!

Rift S is *not* a bad system at all though.  It's just that the Quest's native VR stuff just *works* and I love that, and now that you can hook it into a PC for a quality PCVR experience.

If you really have a VR dedicated space figured out that's near your PC and you don't see yourself playing outside of that space, the Rift S is going to give you a slightly better experience.  But you can use the Quest in a lot of places, and pairing it with Virtual Desktop, you can use your computer wherever your Quest is, and you can even stream VR games without a cable.

Not to mention you can play through Half Life right now on the Quest, from start to finish, with proper VR controls too.  And this is a native app so you don't even need a computer to do so (Though you need a computer to get the files onto the Quest in the first place).",oculus

"DO NOT get the Quest for PC VR. I've been using it today and it's not great. The Rift S is likely to be far more comfortable than the Quest and look much better visually. Unfortunately due to the nature of how the Quest Link system works you get video encoding artefacts in your VR content no matter how good your PC is. I don't think this going to go away either and there's not much that can mitigate these problems as there's going to be a limit to the video bitrate on either the nvidia NVENC block or the Snapdragon 835 decoder in the quest headset. People will yell up and down ""But it's beta, it's BETA"", yes it's beta software but I don't think you're going to get a magic bullet to fix this one, it's just an inherit part of video encoding tech.

From the second I started using link I could tell something was off, everything had that lossy video encoding ""edge"" to it, and then I played the desert map in Arizona sunshine, holy heck the red rock just turns to gross mush (this is because video codecs generally put lower emphasis on red as they do the other colours, which our eyes are more sensitive to).

"Common sense hey. Common sense would dictate that not everyone’s play space can work well with sensors. In my case there was literally no way to set them up in a way that gave both decent 360 tracking and floor level tracking due to a small playspace and objects like bed and desk blocking stuff. The rift S on the other hand doesn’t get blocked by any objects, floor tracking and 360 are perfect out of the box without purchasing a third sensor.

Not to mention all it takes is a quick look around to find that the rift s tracking vs the cv1 is only slightly different in most use cases. I never stated it as a fact. I stated it as my experience with it. Not everyone is allowed to just mount shit on their walls or has the room to even do so, and by that logic for a lot of people the rift s is simply better.  I used sensor setup and everything and trust me the experience has just been less hassle and better in general for me. I loved my cv1 but this has just been a better overall experience bar audio quality which is easily fixed. 

TL:DR CV1 tracking is great if you can set it up well to suit your playspace but the rift s tracking is pretty much the same in almost all cases without effort or extra money.  And if your space doesn’t suit sensors it is just better. Not to mention I can still grab stuff from behind me with a rift s without issue in normal play.",oculus

"Sure, we can have different opinions. And that's why my conclusion is not final as well, since Oculus Link is still in beta and like the tracking before I'm sure Oculus can pull off some magic to improve it. 

And I do care about the black levels, as I stated it made the games a lot more atmospheric, but I just prefer the clarity of a RGB stripe panel. Cheers.",oculus
"I have common sense. The moment you say huge playspace your argument for why it’s better goes out the window. I have a small playspace and you just could not set the sensors up in a way that didn’t get either blocked by objects, loose floor tracking or have them basically on top of you. Rift s tracking avoids all of these issues and doesn’t require money for a third sensor for decent 360 and large room scale tracking. Sorry not all of us have perfect large rooms for VR with places to mount sensors.  

Also, this guy is buying a rift s or quest so this doesn’t even matter. Tracking works great and that’s all that matters really for most people. I can grab stuff from behind me fine on the rift s without a hitch. It’s only if you keep your arms there that it drops out.

I believe they even mentioned that this approach was more or less at the center of the half life philosophy, to make a full length tech demo with a well developed story and polished engine. 

I think I stuck that in the back of my mind and forgot that I saw it in some random interview with very few views, because I've always thought of this as common knowledge. I've been saying since the Oculus was first announced in 2012 that the next HL game would be in VR. It just made sense that this was the next leap in technology that Valve was waiting for.

However I didn't think it would be this early in VR's lifetime. We still don't have widely accepted or agreed upon input methods or motion methods. However I think there will be another HL game that follows this once we see a breakthrough in input technology. Maybe another once we see some mature ray tracing headsets too.",oculus
"Quest IMO, but factor in the need for comfort mods (loads on quest sub).",oculus
"&gt; that it would be nice to have the option.

The first problem is it being an option.

Go and GearVR aside, there is essentially one set of controllers for the entire Oculus ecosystem. As a developer you can assume that all CV1/Quest/Rift S owners will have stuff like capacitive touch sensors, easy-to-click thumbsticks and the like.

If they release optional controllers, a relatively small percentage of people will buy them. This makes it hard to justify spending time on something that few people can use.

Also, developing these options has a heavy R&amp;D cost, and IMO working on 3rd-generation hardware is a better use of Oculus's engineers than making options maybe 10% of people will buy.",oculus
"Ya, let Insomniac know. I think they mentioned on the launch day stream they may change the quick join feature",oculus
I think I'm not understanding the problem. I thought a new non-VR game was showing up in your library. I'm not sure what the pic with the RPO games is supposed to show.,oculus
"lol, go look at the new MS flight. The entire flight sim crowd which are pretty much the only people that buy these games only play in VR. They all forced Microsoft to delay the launch and make a VR port. VR is not niche anymore, it's becoming more and more mainstream by the day.",oculus
I got that in less than an hour without exploring lol,oculus
"I'm, Valve literally engineered modern day VR. There would be no VR today without the secret valve VR room. It's what inspired lucky and iribe to start Oculus.",oculus
"Can you please give an option to not highlight plants in visor? Also an option to turn off health and other indicators from visor. Or make the health and energy bar very thin and at the edges. The visor detracts from the beauty of this game. 

But the number one thing that needs to be patched is that guy always reminding you that you have a lot of materials you should spend them at the work bench. 

Finally, please add a no visor escalation 2 achievement.",oculus
"Yes, about 10 million of us and we have all been waiting for this day. Kind of a dead comment....",oculus
"World building was being done in games, but Half-Life brought that fairly continuous world that felt like living world to fps first. Before Half-Life fps games were very different with little to no scripted events and the interactions were pressing buttons to open doors and so on. Just the opening sequence of Half-Life with Gordon riding the train set it apart from the past fps. Half-Life just was a truly revolutionary shooter at the time, but of course it was just bringing things over from other genres.",oculus
I take my Quest to work everyday and play Vader Immortal or Racket NX.,oculus

Yeah I've modded my odyssey so it's actually pretty decent comfort wise now. I'm more wondering about the clarity/resolution anf fov. How do they compare?,oculus
I can see in the next 10 years that flat gaming will be a thing of the past and virtually everyone will be in VR. Flatgaming will not live forever.,oculus
But how did it know the position of another guardian area relatively to the current one?,oculus
"Yup, it was even hinted about 8 years ago during the valve secret VR room tests since Valve was literally using HL2 in VR to show off VR technology they engineered (early Vive prototype). That room is the reason that VR exists today, it's what made lucky and iribe start Oculus and what made Zuckerberg buy it.",oculus
I thought it would be almost all angry flat gamers but VR is getting a lot of support in that thread. Even from people who don't have a headset yet.,oculus
"Thanks for sharing this!

I'm curious if it works with a USB card (Inatek for example) . My PC does not have USB C Ports since its only a Z97 Board",oculus
"Asgard's wrath feels very AAA, so does stormland",oculus
"Yup, that was the first thing I noticed.",oculus
"True the 3 finger based gesture tracking is good enough for everything vr throws at you and the 5 finger based index tracking doesnt give enough freedom for tasks where it would be usefull for example typing on a vr keyboard or playing vr guitar or penspinning, i know those are not the best examples.

Even in real life you more often than not use your pinky ring and middlefinger in union and your index finger and thumb seperately. And most tasks that require 5 fingers wont be achievable with the index either.

I guess you can flip off people with the index controllers so i guess they have that going for them .",oculus
"I'm hoping 3 is at least as good as 1, because 2 was a considerable step down in both length and gameplay.",oculus
There is nothing special about index to make it exclusive.,oculus
"I enjoy it. But you need a guitar hero controller and mount for your controller which only came with the original Rift touch controllers. You have to buy it from the rift accessories store or 3D print one. 

Not sure if they make the guitar controllers anymore as there was an issue with that last year, possibly it got resolved though",oculus
"You're welcome!  Sadly since I don't have any expansion cards on hand and thus can't say for sure if they will work.

But you don't need a USB C port on your PC, as Oculus Link also works on USB A ports (but seems like only USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports works in my case), in fact in mainly test the Link using the ANKER USB Type-C to Type-A cable and it worked fine.",oculus
"&gt; Most people aren’t going to get a headset for only one game. 

People bought Switches just for Zelda. And besides, that's exactly the point, bring multiple known franchises (Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, etc) not just one. It is absolutely the right place for VR to go, as it forces people who have no interest in VR whatsoever (because in their minds thanks to the general media it's just tech demos) to pay attention.",oculus
"Kind of, except AR/VR headsets will totally kill monitors at some point",oculus
"The oculus software is proprietary, in that you have to use it if you want your oculus rift to work.",oculus
"I've also done all the comfort mods I could find, velcro straps on the side, a top strap, plus the thick VR Cover foam just to get it comfortable and it's still nowhere near as comfortable as the Rift S.

As for the clarity and all that. There's no anti SDE filter so there are visible pixels there unlike the O+, but the Rift S feels more crisp, less blurred, even if there's a really faint SDE, and when I say there is an SDE, it's nothing like the CV1 or Quest pentile one, it's pretty subtle. I think most of the clarity also comes from the fact that the lenses are really, really good, definitely better than the O+, the entire FOV is clear and there's a huge sweet spot.

FOV is an interesting one, it's really usually subjective between people when they're this close, but it seems like it's basically on par and the Rift S lenses are really easy to jam up against your eyeballs to get more with the eye relief adjustment and the thin default foam.

Tracking and controllers are the really big thing. If the O+ had the same tracking and controllers it would be great because the headset itself is great visually, but the controllers and tracking on it just kills it and makes it feel more like a toy headset than a real one.

Overall the Rift S is a better headset, I guarantee you won't want to pick up your Odyssey again if you get one.",oculus
The track I assume is from rFactor1,oculus
For the good of all of us,oculus
The non VR showing is also the problem ^^ i played this game couple of days ago yes,oculus

"Hi, try new batteries, and if that doesn't work try running the repair function in the oculus-setup.exe (the same .exe you used to install the software). If you are still having the issues, please reach out to our support at [support.oculus.com](https://support.oculus.com). Thanks",oculus
"some people have trouble explaining this - ill try.   
  
most people who get their dick blown off by the Quest have never had good PC vr.  granted, PC vr can be a dick to setup sometimes - but theres nothing like it.  
  
the quest isnt comfortable - and unless you have a really specific reason for needed a portable solution - if you can afford a good gaming PC, dont try and justify the Quest.  
   
i have a Quest now, and a Valve Index -honestly I'll get the Quest setup with link tomorrow and Ill be super disappointed with it and sell it and return the cables I bought.   
   
so if you can buy a breddy gud PC, get a Rift S.  If you can build a better PC then get a valve index.",oculus
"The quest from what I hear is almost as good as the rift S with the link cable, I have not tried it yet though.

Quest stand alone is pretty fun though, I love playing Pavlov on my quest.

If you want freedom and PC VR then get the quest , if you want a better pcvr experience then rift s",oculus
For others with failed link cable attempts who own RTX cards: try connecting the cable (with usb-c adapter) to the VirtualLink port of your RTX. The power supply and data throughput on VirtualLink is much more stable than on mainboard ports.,oculus
"In order to reset the view in that game and any other steam game is to open up SteamVR. Then click the small 3 lines in the top corner of the SteamVR menu. Then click on the settings tab. Then go to the developer tab in the SteamVR settings. In there you will be looking for ""Room and Tracking"". After you have found that then select Large Space. After you have done that now take your VR headset off your head and place it down on the floor in the spot you want your center of your play space to be at. You should have the front of your headset facing the way you want your front of your playspace to be at. Then leave it on the ground where you chose to put it at and then click the quick calibrate button. After you have did that then your finished and there you go that will be your new playspace position.",oculus
"People attacked you because you attacked them. Have some self awareness, at least.",oculus
"&gt;S.Moving on to picture clarity, this is where I feel the Quest’s PenTile OLED panel is showing its limitations and I would prefer the clarify of Rift S’s RGB stripe panel


Sure... but the softness is mainly coming from the heavily 
  compressed image  at ~150 mbit, vs an uncompressed 18 Gbps signal... it's not even a contest.",oculus
Have you tried running link? I connected the quest to my 1060 max q laptop and it just worked.,oculus

"Agreed, better wait for more reviews and testings for your case.",oculus
"Thank you so much, i will try this tomorrow. I was doing quick calibrate without putting the headset on the floor and was so confused on why I would be inside the ground. Thank you!",oculus
"Yep there are so many ways to tackle it. Some of which is inside the game design, but also there's a lot you can do outside the game... Managing the community, hosting weekly and monthly events, encouraging small local groups to have play nights, promoting influencers and original content, weekly challenges/themes, ways to find a team, promoting any fitness aspect... Talking directly with VR arcades so they execute in the best way possible.   
I've always said that the ideal VR game brings new people in to VR... your game looks like it can do it. It's just that development is only half the battle, the other half is delivering.",oculus
"I totally agree that it's important for the game, but it's not important to showcase in the video.",oculus
"AI improvements, please :)",oculus
Plugged in the quest and said connect to oculus in the pc software.  Nothing special.,oculus
Yes :),oculus
I was just being pedantic anyway 🙂,oculus
"Agree.

Also, I'd like to have some AI improvements, that could make the game last much longer despite being quite repetitive",oculus
I believe it is,oculus
"That's great thank you all, she has a xbox so when she originally told me she wanted a vr I was going to get her a ps4 with the ps4 vr, would you say the oculus would be better suited for her?",oculus
Not to mention that once you upgrade the flying and gliding boost to the maximum  it is absolutely spectacular to move from one place to another. That alone is almost rreason enough  to warrant it's purchase.,oculus
"I have both. Both are great and if finances allows it, I'd recommend both.

If I'd have to choose only one? Without hesitation: Quest. And not because of Link.

All in one system is something else. I'd say what Oculus have done with Quest is the only true next gen VR so far. Console like approach, easy of use and convenience are amazing. What little presence it looses due to 72hz, it gains it all back with being wireless. Quest was the only VR hmd that actually gave me true vertigo. With PC hmds wire always reminds me I'm in my room. Quest let me forget all about it and just be in the game/experience. It's liberating. I have more fun on Quest.

Oculus Link is just a cherry on top.

That being said, Rift S is much, much more comfortable. 80hz with LCD gives you more immediate presence and screen is sharper. Since Quest also requires a cable to play on PC (if you don't count VD streaming) it doesn't really have advantage over S here.

So it really depends what you are most interested in. PC VR or wireless mobile gaming with a chance to play some PC exclusives. If former, then get Rift S, if later then Quest.",oculus
Definitely worth the upgrade.,oculus
Still sucks that man baby’s on YouTube keep on throwing a hissy fit that they can’t play it on a pancake screen.,oculus
You could probably try buying the game.,oculus
Sorry i lack knowledge on this topic. I thought VR sets run on PCs. Is that not the case?,oculus
"4/5 of top level comments so far have a negative comment, and I'm just like, this is why I got into VR 2 years ago. Competitive multiplayer arena, with a strong aesthetic, with game design that amplifies/mitigates VR's unique elements, on a mass-market all-in-one headset. I hope I'm not the only one.",oculus
"Quest/Link is amazing, but sound is bad and it's less confortable than CV1.

The 72Hz, unless you have ASW, 36Hz is much worst than 45Hz, huge difference.

The rest, it's better than CV1, but image quality is just a little better, I guess Rift S is sharper.

I would recommend Quest for people interested on standalone or IPD's out of range.",oculus
"This Glycon VR seems cool, kind of democratizing Mocap for indies !!!!!",oculus
"I just don't that VR as a whole is at a level where they could that many different IP's to convert as some companies don't take VR that seriously, Valve already knows its potential but Ubisoft, in my opinion, isn't one to step outside of boundaries, they have shown that through the repetitiveness of the Assasin Creeds franchise. The reason that flat-screen gaming is much more popular than VR is because of its accessibility. You need an area to play VR that most pc gamers just don't have. If VR was more accessible by the general population, your statement about bringing more franchises just isn't possible. I don't mean to offend, but to call the people who don't like this announcement ignorant, but you are just as ignorant about this being good for gaming as a whole. You make fun of these people for being close-minded but you ignore the fact that many of these people can't even get VR. The great thing about pc gaming is that there is no fixed price. however, this means that many things require much higher expenses for some people than others. I personly had to buy a new graphics card for VR. But for some people, a new system is required for VR as some have budget builds. This could result in upwards of $1000 dollars just to use VR. This obviously isn't ideal. Aswell people who suffer from bad motion sickness can't ever enjoy a comfortable VR experience. So saying that the only reason people are upset is because of lies is just false. And besides, you ignore the worst part about this announcement, if this game is bad, then AAA VR would die instantly and all the talk about VR being just a gimmick would all become true. Valve is taking a huge gamble here. I doubt the game will be bad however every person I've seen putting down someone for not being totally on board with the announcement has failed to look at the bigger picture. Stop it.",oculus
"The game is an amazing experience, even the opening sequence was interesting and draws you in straight away. However, I didn't know about it at all until I randomly browsed the Oculus store.",oculus

Absolutely.  The quest is pick up and play whereas the PSVR is quite complicated to set up due to the breakout box.  I mean it's not hard but it becomes an annoyance after a while having that extra box.   I'd definitely go with the quest.,oculus
"Good question, because Oculus software wants a lot more free space than it actually occupies.

"I understand where you are coming from I actually ordered my Index from the US and had it shipped to Kenya (currently working on a project here for the rest of the year), so I know it gets expensive for people that are not in Europe or the US. You also got to understand as harsh as it sounds, our markets don't matter as much as those that are in Europe and US or China. The adoption rate for technology/size of the market is not large enough to be a large concern. So as much as it may be more pricy for us, it is more important that it isn't for people in the markets with the largest adoption rates because without them these products would even exist. Sucks but it is a reality. Im a US Citizen, but I still deal with the pains as the nature of my job sometimes has me on other sides of the world for extended periods at a time. I am perfectly content with why it is necessary though. You just gotta extra save up for that hardware buddy, depending on how much you want it.

"Received mine yesterday. Only had a bit of time to try it out. I tried Skyrim but I think I didn't calibrate correctly. Walking straight was okay but when I turned my head I seemed to side step to the other side somehow. Must be calibration. Will try more tonight.  


Right now, I;m not super impressed. It's fun though, you feel goofy with your feet in the air and that is actually a bit of fun and looks fun from the outside for others to see",oculus
Can I play this on quest now then?!,oculus
Yes but my point isn't that the blacks aren't better on the quest but that if you don't have both and you haven't tried the quest then I don't feel like I notice the difference. Where as if I played with a quest for a while and went back to the rift s it might start to really annoy me.,oculus

"I have laptop with 6gb 1060 max q. And 7700hq.

And it can run beat saber but not very good.
Yes you can play it in maximum low details. Bit it is not as good when I play it on my computer.
The frames still drop. But it is playable.

Robo recall is totaly unplayable for example.
Pistol whip works great. Doom vfr works.
Arizona sunshine is not playable.

Depents from game to game. But you will have to play in lowest resolution.

And also normal 1060 is stronger than mobile 1060",oculus

"I dunno, the kraken fight was mediocre at best, and the mead hall introduction was mostly walking around randomly until I stumbled into the last guy I needed to talk to by chance.

After that it definitely picked up tho, exploring your powers on the beach and solving the puzzles to get all the chests was fun. Unfortunately only got a chance to play a few hours tho, will definitely have to pick it up at some point",oculus
"Yep! Was alternating between both systems all night doing comparisons. The link turned out to perform surprisingly well for what it is, and it was interesting to see the same games with heavier color saturation and deeper blacks,   When I flipped back to my Rift S I actually appreciated it even more.  Without a question much sharper, and cleaner gameplay. Asgard’s Wrath ran pretty well on Quest, but you can really feel and see the difference once you put the Rift S back on. The S was the superior performer, as it should be.",oculus

"**Game developer**: *anything*

**Gamers**: Has game developer lost its mind? Given the evidence, it would seem so. At the very least, game developer has lost its ability to conduct an intellectual argument. Although my approach may appear a bit pedantic, by setting some generative point of view against a structural-taxonomical point of view or vice versa, I intend to argue that game developer lives in monologue rather than dialogue. I explained the reason for that just a moment ago. If you don't mind, though, I'll go ahead and explain it again. To begin with, with it so forcefully skewering me over a pit barbecue, things are starting to come to a head. That's why we must convey to people the knowledge that game developer holds onto power like the eunuch mandarins of the Forbidden City—sterile obstacles to progress who base racial definitions on lineage, phrenological characteristics, skin hue, and religion.

You may have heard game developer yap about how it is a refined organization with the soundest ethics and morals you can imagine. It's not uncommon to hear such admixtures of New Age babble and poststructuralism in game developer's jargon. To translate, we must show game developer that we are not powerless pedestrians on the asphalt of life. We must show it that we can defy it. Maybe then game developer will realize that its spittle-flecked rants are merely a stalking horse. They mask game developer's secret intention to condemn innocent people to death. I've heard even iracund dips apologize for their poor judgment. game developer never has. The significance of this is that society has been taking an increasingly lax attitude towards game developer's goading unsavory, volage-brained mattoids into hurling epithets at its opponents. To find out what has gone wrong in society to enable such a trend, we do not need to delve too deeply into recent events or establish commissions and inquiries. We know what has gone wrong. Specifically, game developer has committed a number of heinous acts against society. Its most piacular offense, however, is perhaps its promoting adventurism's traits as normative values to be embraced. As unconscionable as such behavior certainly is, game developer would not hesitate to bribe the parasitic with the earnings of the productive if it felt it could benefit from doing so.

Now, I don't mean for that to sound pessimistic, although if you've never seen game developer hurt the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society, you're either incredibly unobservant or are concealing the truth from yourself. If you think that game developer is the foremost truth-teller of our time then you're suffering from very serious nearsightedness. You're focusing too much on what game developer wants you to see and failing to observe many other things of much greater importance such as that it's a serial exaggerator. If I were to be less kind, I'd say game developer is a liar. Either way, whenever it claims that the majority of infelicific calumniators are heroes, if not saints, I can't help but think that it has just subtracted from the sum of human knowledge. An equal but opposite observation is that it once wrote a document whose sole purpose was to argue that the eradication of its traducers would restore mankind's golden age and save humanity from ruination. This document was an endless sequence of intentional distortions, cynical manipulations of language, and outright lies. It served no purpose other to get people thinking about how you may have noticed that even game developer's least refractory confidants supplement their already-generous incomes by selling contraband on the black market. But you don't know the half of it. For starters, it is time for people of honor and courage to advance freedom in countries strangled by tyranny. This issue is coming to the fore because game developer often misuses the word “crystallographically” to mean something vaguely related to narcissism or solecism or somesuch. game developer's yes-men, realizing that an exact definition is anathema to what they know in their hearts, are usually content to assume that game developer is merely trying to say that human rights can best be protected by suspending them altogether. In closing, I consider this letter to be required reading for everyone who still cares that no matter how much game developer squirms and wriggles, it will never escape the fact that one of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is libertinism. Unfortunately, with our nation's media being as controlled as it is, there's no way that this letter will be widely publicized. Therefore, I'm counting on you to pass on this letter to all of your e-mail contacts. Thank you.",oculus
"I have Rift S and I've been thinking really hard about selling it and getting the quest lately. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can you tell more about diffrences? I've heard Quest is heavier and less comfy for longer sessions. Also how big of a diffrence is there in terms of quality. Is it noticable or you have to actually try to spot the diffrence? My main focus is PCVR so link, its performance and quality would be really important to me. Also is the 8hz diffrence noticable? I would expect no but since you can compare them its forth asking.",oculus
"Nah, because wind changes direction in the game.  The ceiling fan on high doesn't feel like any direction,  so the in game visual suggestion tricks your mind.",oculus
"If your main focus is PCVR I don't know why you'd switch to a Quest when you have a Rift S already unless you really really want that standalone experience. 

For me there is an obvious different in screen quality. Quest is still better than CV1 if you ever used that, but I still notice SDE almost immediately whereas I have to look for it on the S more often than not. 

And comfort for me is 100% the biggest seller of the S for me. Out of the box it's several times more comfortable than the quest. People can recommend counter weights, Vive deluxe straps and more mods but that's extra cost, plus you'll have to fork out for either the official link cable when it's out ($80) or look for 3rd party solutions which will likely be heavier than the rift s cable. 

Quest is a great device, and link adds a lot of you already had one. But I wouldn't recommend moving from Rift S if you're a PCVR gamer.",oculus

"Rift S is my first VR headset, the first expirience I had with VR was DK1 but that was... well you know, a prototype, a new thing.

Ive had Rift S for just a month and well, having an option to go wireless would be nice, the cable is heavy and for less demanding, eye candy games it would be nice to loose the cable. With S I dont have an option for that, theres no wireless adapter like for CV1 or Vive. Would be nice to play something like blade and sorcery wireless (with virtual desktop or something cuz im aware that its not available for quest)

&amp;#x200B;

Its not a big deal but I like to have options, with Rift S I feel like im stuck and don't have options to expand on my expirience :D

But then seeing all the comments I feel more and more like I should stick with Rift S, its a great expirience and I have so much fun playing on it",oculus

"I much prefer the S to the Quest honestly and at home I'll usually play the pc version of a game even if I have it on quest. But everyone is different, you have evangelists on both sides. Ultimately it is a personal decision.

I always recommend getting both if you're decently wealthy but it is a bit much to spend $800 on two pieces of equipment with a large overlap of functionality.

If you can demo a quest anywhere, or afford to buy a quest to test and return or sell your S afterwards that's the best option, but it's your money.",oculus
"I agree with everything.
The weirdest part is the ""what do I do once I defeat the Terminus?"" just wait one week for the next cycle? that's strange, you should be able to keep playing at your own pace.
And what happens when Insomniac stops supporting the game in a few months? will it keep creating new cycles or not? I don't get that, is it a feature within the game itself or is it Insomniac pushing an update that changes the world? I take it it's the former but then there is really no reason not to be able to go to the next cycle anytime you like without waiting one week.

That being said, the game is amazing; the traversal is incredible, the way you can fly around once you upgrade certain skills is one of the best features I've seen in any VR game to date.",oculus

"It is a very unique concept and I like it. Actually, I can't think of any previously released game that reminds me of Stormland. At first the game feels quite puzzling as you can't recognize the familiar patterns how games usually work and progress. Very refreshing.

However, it does have the *From Other Suns -syndrome* where the amount of content isn't really enough for the concept. I was having seriously hard time trying to distinct what changed between the two cycles. Also, the combat is not as difficult and rewarding as it should be in a game like this.

Stormland isn't Division. In Division, AI is actually decent, you have PvE and PvP, you have a challenging 8-man raid, you have loot and builds out the ass. Finding a new gun in Division has meaning - it'll have 3 talents and stats that affect its performance.

Stormland isn't Far Cry, because that one had more weapons, suitable for variety of engagements. Which means Stormland is missing a bow, a silenced rifle, etc., etc. And bow came with multiple arrow types. etc. 

Stormland isn't Borderlands. If we could replay the game as Nyx, Riggs, etc., that would be similar to Borderlands. If each of those had three unique talent trees, then it would be Borderlands. If it had a 40 hr campaign, then it would be Borderlands. 

Each one of these other games had a POINT to it. In Division you need gear to get into progressively harder content, and difficulty gradient is palpable. Even with gear, only a tiny portion of population managed to beat the raid, because not only is it individually challenging, it requires clockwork teamwork from 8 people simultaneously. Borderlands got by on characters and the story, which Stormland sort of attempted but gave up on after 4 hrs. Exploration could have been a thing, but currently there's nothing to explore, it's exact same problem as Fallout 76 had, where you are figuring out what happened, chasing down leads, all the time knowing full well everyone is already dead, and there are no talking humans in the game. That's Stormland's problem - when you explore an island, climb to the top, and find a chest, unlike Division, Borderlands, Skyrim, etc., it's not exciting because you know what's in the box, it'll be one of the 6 guns in the  game. And it won't be a living, talking NPC you haven't seen, offering you an interesting quest. 

Problem is...Stormland isn't anything! I very reluctantly had to admit to myself that Stormland is just another tech demo. It's a MAGNIFICENT tech demo, mind you. Absolutely the best, tech demo of the year, easily. But still a tech demo. It lacks  basic things that would make it an actual, structured, cohesive game. Right now, outside the short tutorial, it's basically another sandbox to showcase the tech in, like Blade &amp; Sorcery. It's just a much bigger sandbox, and the tech being showed off is traversal instead of physics based combat. But that's about it.

Now, I'm not denying that it can be fun, for the right person. But that's not a very good metric, because some people are more easily entertained than others. There's people who can literally watch paint dry and think it's the best thing ever.",oculus
"The trigger, grip and thumbstick buttons are touch sensitive, so there's basic finger tracking in the sense that they know when you're touching those buttons (but not pressing them), and they display the appropriate finger positions and animate between them e.t.c.

"All depends on your play area - I extended the cable as i wanted to use a pulley system to have the cable overhead.

But VR headsets won't necessarily use full eye FOV. So yeah it really depends.

"Thing is, in a normal game, stealth would have a point to it. And have strong mechanics associated with it. For example, in Deus Ex, stealth is best for a non-lethal playthrough, and the game has an achievement to beat the game without killing anyone - you knock them out, you tranq them, but you keep them alive. In Splinter Cell, it was a way to obtain information via interrogation that you otherwise wouldn't have. In Far Cry stealth clearing camps was just safer and in some ways quicker. In Hitman the pinnacle of achievement is to kill a target without anyone ever knowing it wasn't anything but an accident or death by natural causes, there would be no trace and no memory of you. In Metal Gear Solid it was just challenging, and many mission challenges require you to be undetected for a while so you don't spook whoever you're following. That's where stealth typically shines. You also usually have the ability to carry/drag/hide bodies, and AI isn't anemic. In all of these games, an all-out battle tended to be very risky and unpleasant. Even in fucking Skyrim stealth had benefits - you could listen to NPCs chat, often getting unique tidbits of story and lore, or a line on some valuables. There was a POINT to the stealth elements, in all these games.

And absolutely NONE of this exists in Stormland. Can you kill by sneaking up? Yah, but then what? Is there non-lethal playthrough like Deus Ex? Nope. Do you get intel you otherwise wouldn't have, like in Splinter Cell? Nope. Do you have dedicated stealth weapons like in Far Cry (bow, silenced gun, silenced sniper)? Nope. Is assassinating the target, as a ghost, where target just dies and none is the wiser a thing like in Hitman or Assassin's Creed? Nope. If the AI as good as MGS, or any of the above mentioned games? Nope. Does it have stealth mechanics such as carry/drag/hide bodies from patrols? Alert stages of patrols? Nope. Is the AI so deadly and dangerous that you feel it's safer to whittle down enemies from the perimeter first? Nope. But you can climb any wall, weeee! 

You say you go over and over the maps, to see if you missed anything. What exactly were you hoping to find? NPCs giving new and interesting quests? That's not in the game after the tutorial is done. Were you hoping for unique and interesting weapons, like Borderlands or Skyrim? That's not in the game either. Were you hoping for new gear? Nope, not in the game. Best you could have hoped for is yet another copy of the same 6 guns, each of which you've torn to shreds more times than you can count already, or some fruits to squeeze. That's hardly a good driving force to keep exploring.",oculus

"As a Rift S owner, I tell all my friends who are getting into VR to buy a Quest. You'll have access to the Quest library + the Rift library. i.e., you're covered either way.",oculus
"Definitely get a Rift S, I had my doubts at first, but it really is a great headset.  I think that the jump from 90 to 72hz if you got a Quest would probably be much less jarring than from 90 to 80hz on the S.  Cable placement on Rift S is much better imo, coming out the back of your head rather than sticking out of the side of your head.  Comfort with the halo strap is night and day from CV1 and Quest, switching from CV1 to Quest is less comfortable as the Quest is much heavier than both CV1 and S.  

Tracking on Rift S is better than Quest, but CV1 really is the best if you have an open, dedicated area.  Tracking is generally good, but controllers near your face or behind your back can sometimes lose tracking.  Although, it is really great to only have a single usb port taken up for VR instead of 3 or 4, or 5.  Hand tracking is not currently announced for Rift S, but I think that it will show up eventually, considering they got it to run on a mobile CPU that's already processing VR.  Even if not, I think in this generation hand tracking will only be used essentially as a tech demo, using menus and specific apps, but it's not really practical for most of VR's applications.

Overall, you will be blown away by the Rift S, as soon as you put it on, you will notice the higher resolution and how the tracking just instantly works with no sensor errors or disconnecting USB sounds, the better lenses, the better comfort.  The only error I've run into I just unplug it and plug it back in and it works fine again.  Whichever choice you make, you will have a noticeable upgrade.",oculus

"I used a CV1 with a 2500k with a gtx 1070 for the first year I had my headset.  It worked just fine for the games that were out at the time like Onward, Robo Recall, etc. but I dont see it playing Stormland or Lone Echo very well.",oculus
"I hope it does include a teaser for the Half Life Cinematic Universe, I mean HL3.",oculus
"You can be video gamey and still tell a good story though. I think a game can still be quite obviously a video game and still tell just as good of a story, and be taken just as seriously as a work of art. Half Life being a great example. I firmly believe having Gordon speak would totally change the tone and story of Half Life. Now I feel less immersed, I have to connect with this guy instead, his voice, his lines, his personality.

 I think it's unappreciative of the medium to imply it has to forgo its own strengths and qualities be more like a movie to advance, as if the things that make it a video game are bad. I can be immersed in a game without life like realism and cut scenes. Like when you fall into a trance while playing Tetris, for example.

Honestly I don't want to feel like I'm watching a movie and those games take me out of the experience because they always take control away from me. Cinema inherently does not allow for player control whereas videogames do, to imply that being more like them is the one true way is to say that video games can only improve and be looked at as real art by shedding what makes them, well, video games. Assassins Creed is one of my least favorite series for example because I always feel like control is taken away from me to make it more cinematic and movie like. It puts me to sleep. If I want something easy to play after work Ill just play a cinematic game because you don't have to think anyway. The ""game"" just does it all for you, like watching a movie.

This is not to say that its wrong to make games like that but you can still tell a great story and not be afraid to be video gamey as well. Neither is better than the other, they're just different. It annoys me when I here things like boss battles have no place in video games because they're too gamey. The latter part of that statement in and of itself makes zero sense to me. Now,in a game trying to be more cinematic? Sure, but to say video games as a whole should be that way? I don't get it. You can still tell great stories without trying to make me forget I'm playing a videogame.",oculus

Nope. I suppose you believe CAVE systems and MRI machines are peripherals because they have to hook up to a PC to function?

Up until about 4 months ago Google did not tell people where the 3D areas were. For some unknown reason it was a closely held secret. It did not appear in any Google product.  An independent guy who formerly ran an unofficial Google Earth blog was the only guy that had this information.  Clearly it was leaked to him by someone inside of  Google. But about 4 months ago Google finally added a layer to show these spots in the Chrome version of Google Earth only. It is still not in Google Earth VR.  So the only way you can find these areas is to look them up first in Google Earth.  I've looked up literally hundreds of them that way. About 90 percent of more of the earth is NOT shot this way. So looking them up in Google Earth saves a lot of time.,oculus

So, is there ANY reason to get the Rift S?  Is it more capable?  I know the Oculus Link changed things, so I'm unsure.  I'm very new and this is all a lot to absorb.

"Rift S (like any PCVR) was meant for home gaming. It's very light and comfortable, gaming quality is determined mostly by your PC, and a long enough wire for the maximum space allowed.

Plus no battery needed so you don't have to keep an eye on the power or carry/attach a power bank with you the whole time.

But like any other PCVR, it wasn't meant to be portable, so sharing this with others, or just basically playing it in multiple rooms/places is a hassle because the PC/laptop has to come too.

If that's an issue for you then Quest is your headset. It's a 'bit' front heavy (comfort is relative) but overall an amazing headset that's completely standalone. No PC to lug around, no wires to jump scare you when playing horror games :P

You can either use virtual desktop to access all your PCVR games on your computer or for $35 a month (soon to be $12 a month) you can buy a shadowpc which is a cloud gaming solution which let's you basically rent a vr ready pc which can be accessed anywhere.

Anyone who is upset about it being VR only, needs to look at it in the sense that we are going up the next step. Upgrades are always going to be needed, especially for newer gaming content. When Mario 64 came out, a ton of people got the N64, when half life came out, people made more gaming capable PCs, now that Half Life 3 is finally happening, people are finally going to go out and get VR headsets.",oculus

"Played a bit with it tonight using the 10ft cable.  Had issues getting audio to play through it (connected displayed red x instead of green the whole time) but using my gaming headset worked well enough.  Visuals-wise I did not notice any difference between my rift and the link.  Most games I tried had increased performance.  Asgard's wrath actually loaded for the first time without crashing, home was silky smooth instead of the jerky mess I am used to, and borderlands vr was not only smoother but shots were more accurate.  On the other hand, VRchat was an unplayable mess compared to the rift (laggy as hell and constant jaggedy breakup in the image when moving) so it may depend on game.  Gonna try out echo arena tomorrow to see if maybe it was the whole online server aspect affecting things.  All this on an i3 and 1050ti so I am impressed.  If the VRchat issues get worked out, other games show similar smoothness to asgard's wrath and borderlands, and I can get a longer cord I can legit see myself packing up the rift and going with link as my primary pc headset cause why not have the best of both worlds.",oculus
"I don't recall during the tutorial that it ever really clarified that soon as you're airborne you go where your arms are pointing?  Of course you figure it out after a while, once you've had a chance to play around with it.

"Vive is a good option still. Just barely got rid of mine when ok read about the improvements of the index. 

I found my Vive for $250. Wireless attachment cost me $150 and eventually got the index controllers for $250.

Great reception is a given and not a concern for them, kind of the way they released the Index at a premium, knowing that it was too expensive for most, but they were confident in the hardware enough to release it. Valves bottom line is and will continue to be the Steam Store. They do not need VR and the upcoming flagship titles to succeed to keep them afloat. They are doing it for the passion in many ways, and in others to add relevance to the Index HMD's existence. Even if it doesn't make people buy them out in droves, given these titles will be playable on other headsets as well. 

More importantly it will result in an incredibly large number of non steamVR headset users in installing steamVR, meaning they will now be part of the steam ecosystem. The Valve portfolio of products, software and API is more important than one game, the success or failure of one game doesn't do much to their bottom line. They are too invested in VR and as shown in the Valve News Network video titled ""Everything you need to know about Valve Index"". 

They have been working and committed to these 3 titles for an incredibly long time. They are inevitable. The only next moves to be defined are what next after each of them are out

"Quantity does not mean there can be no quality. I dare to say the #1 reason for AWs popularity is the content, where a significant part is the amount of content. Lets face it, the story isn't that great (eg I am not playing because I am so curious how it will end), the mechanics aren't special. Graphically it is good, but we have seen similar (and better) before. But what we have not seen before is a native VR game with the amount of content AW has.

Yes. But. That would be very hard.

I'm not sure what do you mean by lack of proper editor. Neos has the most advanced editing capabilities out there. You have scene inspectors, visual scripting, editing tools and so on, all accessible in-game.

And that's precisely the issue. This ""VR-first"" approach doesn't quite work, nobody wants to spend 6 hours building scenes in a sweaty headset in 35 degrees celsius weather. It doesn't compare to something like Unity or Unreal, where you have precise control and precise placement that isn't locked behind 30 awkward GUI's.

The UI's and menus are a total mess to navigate, and you apparently need someone to guide you through the platform before you know how to do even the simplest things. At this point I appreciate its existence, but ultimately it is unusable for anyone who isn't willing to put up with all the issues and lack of direction.",oculus

"As long as there was a 'ReRift' to play it, I doubt it",oculus
"Does the extra weight really matter if it's balanced?  I thought balance was more important.

Maybe if you get the vive das and then strap a battery pack to the back that might work.  Someone said it felt more comfortable to them then their valve index before.",oculus
"Yeah that's one option but I don't want to spend that money to find it's not really any better for long play times I have intended and still leaves the adjustment knob at the back, not particularly comfortable in a sim rig.

I've made mutliple efforts to make the quest tolerable, but in reality it's half hour stints no matter how many extra straps or padding, it's just too front heavy",oculus
"It's down to face shape more than balance, for me to get enough weight off the cheeks I'm looking at the bottom of the lenses and headset is wobbly, I've tried various solutions, can spend hours in cv1, haven't done that in quest even after the comfort mods, if it's light at the front it's got some really uncomfortable pressure points on the back",oculus
"hopefully not releasing super soon, I'm still waiting on my oculus sensor mounts.

but I'm super excited about this.  I love valve games, they're what got me into gaming after Doom and Duke 3D.  HL, and everything based on the Source engine, have been some of the most enjoyable experiences I've had in games.  From CS, through Portal and more; my favorite games are still Valve titles.

Could push me into buying a newer headset if they keep releasing good stuff. Looking at you, Index. (If they're going all in with their VR tech, maybe so should I - that being said, I still love the Rift CV1)",oculus
"&gt; Unlikely, I tried it out with 3 or 4 friends and we were all in the same instance.

Still, like I said what you described sounds like the old calibration system, the new one has the quick calibration like I described.

You can delete humanoids the same way, grab a hand or hand and select ""Destroy"" from the menu as you would for object, scene editor is not necessary.

&gt; And that's precisely the issue. This ""VR-first"" approach doesn't quite work, nobody wants to spend 6 hours building scenes in a sweaty headset in 35 degrees celsius weather.    

That's simply untrue. Like I said people have built lots of different things inside of Neos and are building more every day, things you don't see on other platforms. We have companies and universities using it for building educational and training applications and benefiting from the VR-first approach.

If you don't like it yourself, that's fine, it's not for you, but we have a growing community of people who love it for that approach, spend time there every day and even support the development financially, so we're going to keep building it that way.

I'm not saying Unity and Unreal don't have advantages and aren't much more mature, but I believe there are merits to a new approach as well and I love exploring new area like that.

I agree that the UI's have a big learning curve, as they're largely functional and kinda overgrown by now. We have just started an UI overhaul, where everything will be redesigned to make the usage simple from the beginning and make the learning curve low. It's simply part of the development process, these things take time. I believe that will significantly improve the usability.
 
I'm not really sure why you'd think it lacks direction though? Every decision and development has been strongly influenced by the goals and vision behind Neos. We're taking a slow, sustainable approach to ensure that everything is built on a solid core.",oculus
"I have a rift, early one which costs loads and is still doing the job fine, but if it does die and I have a headset that could potentially do the job of replacing it that I already own and not using, makes sense to get some use out of it rather than yet another headset, I'd rather wait for the next wave of headsets from oculus and get by with a hacked up version without spending any more money than I already have.",oculus
"Only if you're using Touch or Vive. Some tools use the joystick or touchpad for their function, so it's not possible to use it for locomotion as well.

If you're using Index or MR controllers you don't have this limitation as they have both touchpad and joystick. It sucks for these other controllers, but there's not much of an alternative.

I'm left-handed too and I just move with my right if I'm using those tools.",oculus
"Currently the top post of all time in the valveindex sub; the hype is real over there. I think this being the Oculus sub they might be worried Valve is gonna pull a Facebook and make it exclusive to Index or something 😂 don't worry BBs, Valve won't do you dirty like that.",oculus
"The rumor is that it'll be coming in March 2020.

This comes from a leaked interview between Geoff Keighley, Robin Walker, and Gabe Newell. The interview will most likely be released on Thursday.",oculus
"Another option is sell the CV1, and use the funds (and the $100)  towards a Rift S. It'll be $350 on BF",oculus
"Hmm, maybe you should just sell your quest and get the rift S.  You'd get nearly all your money back from the prices I've seen in ebay.  Plus rift S is havi ng a black Fri sale.",oculus
"A half decent 1080p TV is going to look better than either of those headsets any day, I’m afraid (except maybe for the great contrast on the Quest). The resolution in the headsets just isn’t there yet. Depending on the size of your virtual screen, you’ll get between SD and 720p resolution. And 720p is probably being generous. 

It’ll do in a pinch if you have no other way to watch something, and it’s a fun novelty to watch a movie in a virtual cinema for a while. But if you’re really looking for a true Tv replacement and don’t care about games and such, then in my honest opinion you’re better off with a TV. 

Oh, and there are definitely noticeable god rays and light rings from the fresnel lenses on the Quest. They are less noticeable on the Go, but that’s due to the less contrasts screen. 

Not trying to rain on your parade, I have both headsets and love them, but I’d rather watch a proper TV any day of the week for standard rectangular video content.",oculus
"Yeah, that's why I asked. I guess I'll be back in a couple of years then :)",oculus

I’m 80 sure you can,oculus
"nice, so you won't need them during setup right?",oculus
"Honestly, I wouldn't get a VR headset to just watch TV with.  But it's so much more than that you don't even realize yet how amazing it is.  I'd get the quest.  Go is going to die out imo and quest can do so much more.",oculus
"Too much invested in it and for what it's all costs haven't used that much, not looking for an upgrade just a means of replacement when it eventually dies, here's hoping it's a few more years yet but using quest that's gathering dust could be an option for now",oculus
"I guess no to be honest e never tried without the controllers but I can’t think why it wouldn’t work 🤔 if you have time to go back and get the controllers I’ll suggest to get them anyway and if you can’t, I mean, you will know in a bit if I were wrong 😂",oculus
"Good idea, but I am not sure I can fit most models in that room. Can't use ceiling mounts, and there is quite enough furniture there already to make wall-mounting an exercise in frustration. Still, I'll think about it.",oculus
"Got about £900 sunk into cv1 stuff, I'd get nothing near that for it all and it's more than comfortable enough and being used alot, not looking for any clarity increase, just a backup for when it dies, I full my intend to keep it until then, may not be able to find another cv1 at that point which is why I'm interested in making quest useable for longer play sessions.",oculus
"I don't really need it for anything else, though. Unless it is also usable for writing, of course, but I don't think it is. So I guess it's a pass for me for now.",oculus

Granted not all heads are the same but your description is textbook 'doing it wrong'.",oculus
On top of this if you know how to get to the run menu in windows use the command dxdiag to get a system run down. This will help people let you know what to upgrade. Oculus also has a a system check tool.,oculus
"Has this been released yet in a more user-friendly (i.e. *way* easier to setup) way? I tried it months ago, and while I really dug it (when I finally managed to get it working), there seemed to be a lot of setup hoops to jump through (for my tastes anyway), and customizing anything in it, was kind of wonky and hacky, as I recall.

I know it's still in beta, but is setting it up *any* easier at this point (like a simple, proper installer, etc.)? I have a new PC since I first tried it, but might just wait to reinstall, until it's more polished and consumer-ready, if it's not more streamlined at this point.",oculus
"Install and run Speccy, then post the screenshot here. we'll tell you if your PC is VR compatible and what upgrades you need.",oculus
The headset rides down quickly to the cheekbones even after fitting it correctly. It is the weight of the front doing this. After market facial interfaces that give a bit of friction to stick to the face help with it. Also counter weighting can help prevent the front coming down and sitting on the cheek bones.,oculus

Reloading is done by scavenging enemy weaponry, or simply throwing away your weapons and picking up enemy weaponry. (I used a mixture of the two strategies, there are times for both).

About half the weapons increase their accuracy when in two-hand mode. There are also mods to increase your ammo capacity, mods to reduce recoil, and you eventually get far more ranks of weapons. My SMG has something like 450 bullets available to use.",oculus
"I got a good four hours or so out of the main campaign (which still continues into the first cycle, somewhat, which took me another 4-5 hours to beat).

Personally, I can use it for around 1 hour - 1.5 hours max. While it's not painful, I can feel the weight on my face almost all the times.    

I've heard you can make it more comfortable with mods, but that will cost you an extra $100. I haven't bothered as I only use it for short busts.",oculus

Not expecting an amazing experience with Link and think media that tried it were a tad biased due to excitement of being there to try it, and the rigs used were very high end.  Inaccurate info fed out from the event, and took a few weeks for technical logic to catch up.

It does not help that most of the “Rift S is dead” hyperbole was from media that appear technically clueless and some on Reddit echoed them.  That said, a PC version of the same game on Quest will still look far better- even with the compression.   

Looking forward to trying it, none the less.  I still think that there will be at least 20% more overhead from native VR, since has to also encode, render and compress.",oculus

**Transference**. Scary, if that's okay with you. Great story, incredible audio-visual design and immersion.

**The Solus Project**. Adventure sci-fi. Starts slow and feels like it will be kinda 'eh', but stick with it and once it digs its claws in, it becomes an amazing game with a fantastic sci-fi story.

**Arca's Path**. Unique game, subtle and simple but impeccably designed. A great short story told entirely through visuals.

**Pixel Ripped 1989**. So creative and unique and fun, a light story but it is full of character and world immersion.

**HOST**. Very short game (I think about 15 minutes?), but so unique and immersive and great environmental design. Sci-fi adventure, not really a 'story' but an immersive space/world that carries a subtle progression of discovery. Requires a large play space, as you don't move with controllers, you move by moving, for the entire game. It is designed specifically so that you will be walking around your playspace in a certain way, so you need the required space.",oculus
"I have only played Brass Tactics. Which looks amazing, and it is reasonable immersive controlling it from above (and seeing your opponent, which you can wonder if it is good for multiplayer). But to be fair: Its gameplay is quite shallow compared to pancake RTS, and I wonder if with VR controllers that will be different anytime soon. I think that is the same as with console RTS: Sure they exist, but overall it is largely a mouse + keyboard genre.

Year later I used first Vive. The wands made so much difference, I haven't felt sick at all. 

Since then I got in love with VR, and about two weeks ago I bought my first headset, that is Oculus Rift S and I'm really fond of it.

Keep saving, in the mean time the oculus link update would be out and people would have hands on impression, if it works as intended and it feels as good as a native PCVR headset then it makes the Quest a no brainer, sort of a Nintendo Switch like VR hybrid.

If not, the S is the one to get, as much as I LOVE the wireless freedom of the Quest, and as much as I HATE the wire of my CV1, there is no getting away from the fact that PCVR gaming is better due to sheer amount of games available and the graphical fidelity of them.

"I haven’t played any of them yet but I would have thought that essentially being able to use your “hands” to group enemies and draw out paths for them to follow would have been great for immersion. The gameplay videos all made it look really fun, and the reviews for these games are generally really good. From what I’ve read, Final Assault gives you the opportunity to zoom right in to the action in an incredible amount of detail, which sounds amazing as well.

Still, I take your point, some things are just better on a specific platform. Still, I’m surprised that only 3 attempts have been made? I would have thought that more developers would be out there trying to find that sweet spot for immersion/gameplay/accessibility given the popularity of the market.",oculus

"Don't rely on too much enthusiasm about this link cacle. It may be great for normal use and slower games being streamed, but fast paced titles could suffer.  We don't know yet, and I suggest anyone giving advice that the Link IS the reason to bypass a full Rift, lower your expectations - you could be sorely disappointed.  We just don't know yet.",oculus
"When I got mine they were really quiet, after the latest update it got higher, i don't know if I was using the default volume as Skuzz said above, but always update the drivers. However, going with the koss alternative is way better since the sound is really important for the immersion imo and you won't be having sound leak problems",oculus
Have you enabled outside sources in the general settings menu?,oculus

Are you sure your height was set up properly both via guardian and in game? In song select there's a menu on the left panel where you can calibrate your height.,oculus
"Ok. I tried and it can also happen if I do it this way, however, you can say it's somewhat less likely to happen since it's harder to decompress the mechanism in when the headset is already on your head. Though, I read some consider this a design flaw. But anyway, what you say is interesting. Now, I need someone to confirm this slippage is by design or if the mechanism is worn or something like that. :)",oculus
Here's my personal list of 25 PC VR games that I think you should definitely play on your Quest through the Oculus Link streaming service. Do keep in mind that you need a VR-Ready PC to run these titles on a Quest. I know it sounds obvious but can be easily forgotten by consumers.,oculus
"That’s cool!

But isn’t it dangerous? Okay if you’re with friends but hopefully no one tries this while alone. You don’t want to end up on the tracks hahaha",oculus
VR in public like that... A horrible plan on so so many levels.,oculus
"Not me.  I'd put it on par with lone echo.  Lone echo just got the hand motions so right and you really feel emotion in it.  It was really well done.  But asgards wrath is great in a different way.  I love the companion pets and the way we can switch between God and mortal.  Both incredibly immersive.

Skyrim is a notch below imo.  Controls are so lame.",oculus
"Really nice post and very useful to everyone! I recently did the Full Tape thing after 2 years of my CV1 usage and after convincing myself that upgrading to a Rift S wouldn't be worth the money, and an Index is too expensive for what it offers.

I'm reinforcing the cable using a sleeve to make it firmer but I also like your method, maybe I should use both. I'm convinced that cables won't be available in the future as it's probably not feasibile, economically speaking.",oculus

"This will be strange because a). We're not Gordon freeman, and b). Alyx is a character that talks.

Imo part of what makes Gordon freeman so endearing as a character to play is that he doesn't speak. He has no voice. 

What's funny is its more immersive imo, and perfectly suitable for VR.

I love Alyx as a character, as an aid to your character, but I'm not excited by the idea of playing her.",oculus
"No no no we were playing veeeery safely 😅.
We were in a closed space with almost no people so it was safe tho",oculus

News/rumor of the HLVR title being announced this Wednesday though, so if true, this could turn out to be a watershed moment for VR, the quality of titles that come after it  and of course the level of VR buy-in from general consumers thereafter.

It may be safe to assume the first Half Life VR game could be Half Life (codename Alyx) and the 3rd is actually Half Life 3. With the second being a new IP or L4D2. Kind of makes sense/seems fitting that their 3rd and final flagship VR title of the bunch be HL3VR",oculus
Can you make a list? Can’t watch the video but would like to know for the future,oculus
If you've been adjusting it without it being on your head and the force of it has made it move back it's possible you've worn out the mechanism. I've never had mine move once adjusting it (whilst on my face),oculus
"Oh, sorry, came in, it works ok, gonna try another one.  The one that came in was printed too loose.",oculus

"Yeah I felt that I wanted to give the new owner info on how they can keep their Rift going much longer than someone who doesn't protect these weak points.

Something I've also saw with regards to the ""Left Side Slack"" method I described above. People have suggested an alternate method of using a [zip tie instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/8o1h6g/anyone_get_a_kink_in_their_cable_right_at_the/e00gt6z/). I've never done that one but I have also seen recent posts that people who used the zip tie method ended up stripping the outside of the cable sheath over time. I just did a search for those posts but couldn't find anything so don't quote me. I'd prefer tape or a softish sleeve like you described. It seems like that could avoid the tearing problem from a ziptie.",oculus
you can play it in the dark? i thought it needed light to configure etc,oculus

I also enjoyed that studio's previous effort, ""Defense Grid 2"" which is a tower defense as opposed to at RTS, but in both cases the perspective is a good fit for VR.  I also wish there were more games along these lines.  I don't even really like this kind of game pancake, but in VR I find the genre very satisfying.

I would recommend the 1070 over the 980ti if possible.  I had a used 980ti for $200 about a year ago and it crapped out on me after a few months.  The 1070 even used will be a good bit newer and you might even find one with a  warranty still (EVGA honors warranty for 3 years even if you bought used, you do need to register on their website with a receipt showing you purchased it from previous owner, paypal receipt works fine if you buy on Ebay).  My 1070ti still has almost 2 years of warranty left, so that's a good question to ask a seller, when did they originally purchase?  If you can get a year or more of warranty it makes a used purchase feel a lot safer and you can get more for your money.

Also the 10 series has VR optimizations that would outperform the 980ti even if all other things were equal.  I am still running a 1070ti on one of my machines and it performs admirably even in Asgard's Wrath/Stormland.  Not perfect framerate on Ultra or anything, but not bad at all compared to the 2070 in my newer machine.",oculus

Holy shit that comment section is salty.,oculus
Cool. Someone else just recommended that here as well. Just looked it up and it’s looks cool! Thanks for the tip,oculus
"Typically you can find market reports. Last year, for example, projected sales were 3.3 bil, instead they got 3.6 bil, with Sony selling a record number of VR units. And this year, with Rift S and Quest, both with inside-out tracking that made it very attractive for filthy casuals, I expect another significant uptick, seeing as Oculus claims they're selling VR headsets as fast as they can make them, and it doesn't appear Quest will even go on sale on Black Friday. That suggests it's selling very well. 

To me, VR really reminds me of what we went through when computer mice first appeared. I think most people here probably won't remember, but it's a lot of the same arguments. What, I need space on my desktop for a mouse and a mousepad, which I have to buy?! I can already move the cursor on my screen with a keyboard! What a stupid gimmick! What, the mouse has a cord, and cord gets in the way so much. I have to open up my mouse and clean the lint from it so the ball can spin? I don't want to exercise my whole arm, which is what I have to do to push the mouse around! Etc., etc. All exact same complaints as with VR right now. But, eventually, people saw the light. Especially when Windows and such started to come out and it became painfully obvious how great mouse was for that. It'll very likely be the same in VR.

But with a caveat - one of the big things about VR is the necessity for the player to get off their fat ass and actually MOVE. Especially in gaming, but even in productivity software - you're making big arm movements. In the first world, a significant percentage of the population is now not just overweight, but utterly obese. In USA, something like 40% are obese, and 30% overweight. So to try and get these people, voluntarily, on their feet, and moving their torso, when they can get by just flicking one wrist around in motions measuring in inches might be an insurpassable obstacle. So we have a Wall-E situation going, where they're just reclining in chairs, and watching stuff on screen (can be in VR, of course, but still), and it leaves at least one hand free for eating and drinking. Bottom line, this might be the biggest obstacle to VR making it into mainstream, which other peripherals didn't have to deal with.",oculus
"Thanks. I must admit, I’m getting a gaming pc at the end of the month and Brass Tactics is one of the 5 games I’m ultimately getting it for. Really looking forward to it",oculus
"It’s cool playing a RTS game in VR like Brass Tactic but there is so much better games in that niche on the flat screen. It has to be dumb down for VR to make the controls works. Playing a RTS game in VR doesn’t make you live a real life experience, it’s just another way to control your units which is less practical than a mouse and keyboard.",oculus

That said, I used my CV1 for the first time in months at the weekend.  Having a cable is horrible, wireless has totally ruined it for me (Virtual Desktop).  When wearing the Quest you are naturally way more dynamic, and the resolution makes a huge difference.

"Thanks. I read through the whole thing, was a lot, and must have missed it. Much appreciated.",oculus
"That was such a weird move for them to make, tying difficulty to real time. I won't say it was dumb,  but maybe it was dumb? Let's be honest - for a lot of people zero difficulty was just trivial, especially in co-op. The AI isn't strong enough to pose a significant challenge, and it doesn't have even a fraction of the tools the player has for traversal. And being locked into that for an entire calendar week is just silly. So it takes you two calendar weeks to push the difficulty up to max, but what if you realize that level 2 is a bit much for you? Now you have to wait TWO full calendar weeks for the difficulty to drop before you can play again enjoyable. That, to me, is utterly insane design choice. There's a reason overwhelming majority of games has a difficulty selection in the goddamn settings menu.",oculus

"I swear people who make these videos are either faking it or have magic powers.  I dimmed the lights in my room and tracking went to hell, I tried using it in my backyard at multiple different times of days, in the shade, in the sun, dusk dawn, cloudly, clear, it never tracks well.

the headset has a built in feature to record gameplay.,oculus
The genre doesn't translate to VR very well. You need to simplify it so much that it's pretty much no longer RTS. At least that's what has been done for now. I didn't play Final Assault but I did play Brass Tactics and it got boring very quickly and it was made by the Age of Empires devs so if they couldn't make a good VR RTS then it's definitely not an easy thing to do.,oculus
It's the best VR game released so far IMO.,oculus
I don't know how much light it needs but it tracked perfectly in all the tunnels. None of them were pitch black.,oculus
"Woah! Nice :)

Thank you, I'll install the demo tonight.",oculus
It’s funny because these are the same people that complain about VR not being good because it has bad games but then complain whenever it gets games that they want.,oculus
Fun fact: if you turn off guardian you get back 5-10% gpu power,oculus
"WOW that looks cool! Really looking forward to trying this out. I'm a big FPS fan and this seems to have potential.

"Hi, thanks! Yes we are still working on everything, but we wanted to show *something* (because... what if people don't like it?). But keep in mind it has to run on a Quest, this is the platform we'd like to release on first.",oculus
I legit thought that was real. Well done.,oculus
"Yep, it's really special. My only wish is that combat was a bit better, too much clipping where if your weapon isn't moving fast enough, or the enemy is too close. It's really good, but still falls behind some of the other games (Until You Fall, etc), and that's real shame. Similarly, controls are often awkward, dodge being a stick + button makes it too slow on highest difficulty to use reliably. Which is again something like UYF did better - stick alone, forward and back, on the RIGHT stick, is dash forward and dash  back. It's really the only thing that marred an otherwise very good game for me.",oculus
"I made a whole video this was just a small clip. Every shot was done in the shade, dusk/dawn or heavy overcast. I played the whole song in locations and then pieced it together later so if a part didn't track well I used a part that did. Not everywhere tracked perfectly the whole way through. The only time that really had trouble was playing in just overcast, it needs to be REALLY dark, other than that everything tracked at a playable level. 

People are mentioning having trouble tracking in the dark but the shots in the tunnels were the easiest since it tracked perfect.",oculus

I'm talking about manner of engagement.  Take a look at FFT: war of the Lions.  It's a first rate port of a AAA game, that due to the nature of it's art looks gorgeous on a phone, and because it's a tbs, it doesn't suffer from the typical interface problems.  It's the perfect scenario for a AAA game on phone.   But it's still a middling success, because it's a big, thinky, narratively driven, media rich, AAA experience, and that hard to play on a 15 minute smoke break, or on the train ride home.

"The best AND easiest is what I run. It's called 'mod assistant' so if you searched Google for beat Saber mod assistant you would find it easy.

Watching the video I actually thought the tunnel shots would track the best.  From my experience overcast is the worst. The IR emitters get washed out in too much direct light.  Didnt mean to take anything way from your video or directly claim you are faking it. It's a cool video. I just have almost no success with anything like this.,oculus

Not exactly what I meant. What I mean is that it probably won’t be a full new installment to the series. More like a short spin-offs based on VR (Which is hopefully 5-8+ hours),oculus
"I understand and agree with your concern, but we have bots and some other tricks up our sleeve.",oculus
"No, it’s really not. Quests are selling much faster than Rifts ever did and it’s because of accessibility and price point, as the heads of oculus have been saying for years. Lower barriers to entry are key.

Hopefully Quest 2 will come with the prototyped separate processing unit that clips to the belt and provides more power to help bridge the gap between rift s and quest. As a PC gamer, I still understand that requiring a PC will never lead to greater adoption of a niche product.

$500 for an all-in ps4 level graphics Quest 2 would do it though. Here’s hoping.",oculus

I'm not saying your video does that because playing on a bridge is obviously impractical but some videos out there make it look like a viable option.,oculus
"Yeah, I mean it's frustrating because I actually think from a systems perspective, stormland has the deepest system for traversal and locomotion of any VR game thus far.

"I see your point regarding technical advancement.  Current VR technology will always be a step below most AAA PC games for the simple fact that VR needs additional processing power.  VR for PC gaming won't truly become mainstream until VR is processed in a way that mitigates the additional processing overheads.  Be that by more efficient rendering techniques, or some kind of co-processing between the headset and the PC.",oculus
Forget theres 2 people there? You know OP watching his friend,oculus
"I think most people's comfort issue lies in the weight, which... I guess the difference for me is with the Quest I'm not putting in long sessions like I would be with the CV1.

Which is a fair argument because... well that's the point of the Quest IMO, quick VR from anywhere.

Where the CV1 will typically end up with longer sessions.

&amp;#x200B;

Things may change when Link comes around and I put actual hours at a time in the Quest, but personally I don't mind the weight.

&amp;#x200B;

What I did however mind was the CV1's back head ring / triangle shape digging into my head which began to \[severely\] hurt within an hour, and I'd just deal with it. And the Quest doesn't have that... so I'd say, if you find the CV1 uncomfortable only in the sense of how it grabs the rear of your head, you may be in the same boat.

&amp;#x200B;

But again, I think a lot of it is because people put a lot longer sessions in than I do. I'm usually an hour at a time, and seated maybe an hour and a half at most...... except that one time I played Lone Echo in one standing (I do not recommend!)",oculus
This comment hurts my head,oculus
"Not side by side. The third Valve flagship title is probably still a long ways off and may become a reality 2-3years from now which seems like an reasonable time for a HL3VR release (that's if HL3VR is not what's announced this year), especially if the rumoured Alyx VR title is not a mainline HL game in the series. Kind of like how there was Uncharted 4 and Uncharted Lost Legacy on the PS4. 

Lost Legacy was a well polished game that could have been a sequel if they wanted it to. It had a deep and rich story, polished gameplay and even had some gameplay/graphical advancements over Uncharted 4. However it had you playing a character that wasn't the main protagonist of the story/narrative, and also wasn't mechanically wasn't drastic enough of a jump to make sense as a sequel for the Dev team or fans.",oculus
How are we supposed to know? You didnt even tell us which one.,oculus
Less blind spots. If I had a 3rd id probably point it at the ground cause I have no tracking near the floor.,oculus

"Which oculus are you talking about?  Oculus GO - no don't buy it.

Oculus quest and rift S - hell yes (though you need a vr ready pc for the rift S).  

If you are talking about the oculus cv1 rift, that's a good price but I wouldn't get it if you have a laptop.  The usbs are very finicky.  Also make absolute sure your pc can support whatever headset you get (if you want to play pcvr and not just quest as a stand alone device).

"It's a neat science project. The heating/cooling part is a little hard to believe. Peltier's usually require a pretty substantial heatsink to work. A nice EL5:  [https://www.marlow.com/how-do-thermoelectric-coolers-tecs-work](https://www.marlow.com/how-do-thermoelectric-coolers-tecs-work)

     Thermoelectric coolers operate according to the Peltier effect. The effect creates a temperature difference by transferring heat between two electrical junctions. A voltage is applied across joined conductors to create an electric current. When the current flows through the junctions of the two conductors, heat is removed at one junction and cooling occurs. Heat is deposited at the other junction.

If the other junction doesn't have a place to put that heat, the Peltier just gets hot.",oculus
We are such easy suckers,oculus
"According to the article it’s the same leaker who leaked DOTA Underlords, so it could very well be credible. We’ll find out on December 12th either way.",oculus
"I could go on and on mate but honestly ive had both headsets and the only thing rift s has over cv1 is a higher screen resolution but its not a better qaulity screen , the rift s screens colour quality is pure shite and you will have to mess about adding headphones too as its built in speakers are pathetic, also the controller tracking is just not as good and all in all the rift s is very very cheaply made its just not as high a standard as the cv1 and finally theres every chance the rift s will not work with your usb,s properly and you will have to mess about adding specific pci usb cards.

In my truely honest opinion the cv1 was a nice bit of qaulity kit , the sound quality is fantastic the picture quality although not as high res as the s is by far way better than the s and tracking is rock solid and no stupid bulging head band stabbing you in the back of your head if you lay back in your chair chilling out.

The fan boys wont admit it but the s was just a cheapo windows mixed reality headset made by Lenovo and oculus slapped there brand on it to make a quick buck.
Cv1 was made to be something special from the ground up.

If nothing else wait it out and see how the quest does with the new link cable , if it turns out that pc vr games run good on it then id even be tempted to leave my cv1 for the quest.",oculus
"you'll need sensors and controllers and a good pc so as long as those are easy to get then go ahead, i personally have the rift cv1 and its my favorite way to play games and i do it whenever i can. however, if you dont think your pc can handle vr games you should look into an oculus quest.",oculus

"I enjoyed it, but you can finish it and the little post-game monologue/elevator ride thing in about 20 minutes, and when you get into it, it's just a 3D puzzle game with a thin layer of Portal-esque humor and some nice looking Aperture Science environments. Runs on Unreal Engine and the physics for objects are a little bit off, but there are no portal puzzles, just a few laser puzzles, companion cube puzzles, and gate puzzles. There's nothing especially challenging about any of them, and you can have them solved at a glance.",oculus

&gt; PC Gamer decided to run this story, with this document linked inside of it. In our opinions, this was a very bad decision on their part, as it has the possibility to delay the actual teaser, trailer, or even the release of the game. From all of us, you should be ashamed of yourselves for deciding to run a low effort article with the sole purpose of rushing a headline before any other media outlet does the same.

So basically ""shame on PC gamer for releasing a story that sourced us"".

That's ridiculous. Also, ""gamers"" can be such fucking babies.",oculus
Not really. Fixing bugs in modern code from more recent games would be a far better exercise.,oculus
Yeah I mean give it a try. Some folks here are fine with it. Playing a few minutes of anything sucked for me but if it fit better I would probably never use another headset. You'll know within a half hour or so if it's gonna work or not.,oculus
"It's terrible! There's nothing more immersion breaking than being surrounded by expressive, talkative characters having a conversation and you're just standing there like a brain damaged serial killer.

It's just something I noticed immediately (first time putting it on). If I have already worn it out by taking it on wrongly a couple of times, then that must also be bad quality, no?

"Besides that, it's very clear they weren't running in Source Engine or any derivative of it, I can't imagine them bothering to reverse engineer the Portal gun into Unreal Engine just for a brief VR fan game.",oculus
"It truly is an amazing game for sure.  In my opinion its one of the best games developed for VR from the ground up.  Every person who owns a vr headset should at least give it a shot and see if they like it.  Im on the third hero so hope to get finished with it in the next week so I can give stormland a try.

The intersting thing to me is the lack of hype from the general gaming news media.  I mean this is next level gaming, but it just gets a short review on a few of the sites and everyone moves on.  

I feel like VR is really struggling to get attention in this age of over information and short attention spans.  If this came out when I was a kid growing up in the 80's it would be seen as witchcraft technology and be all over the major news networks. People would be loosing their minds and kids would be begging their parents for a VR headset. 

Is it that people want an existing IP they can relate to for VR to really take off?  People are more comfortable trying something new when its somewhat familiar I guess.  Or its just that its harder for people to try out vs a console?  Im  at a loss for the general public response to VR in general and groundbreaking games like this.",oculus
"Meanwhile, Rift CV1 cable has been removed from the site, bad news for CV1 owners.",oculus
"Borderlands didn't have it ... you set it by how much you loot. So in Stormland, if you find it's to easy, don't use habilities/scanner ...

Don't get me wrong, I agree with you, difficulty selection would be better, but we have a workaround.

Really the heavy emphasis was on Exploration, Movement, and Free-form combat. And the game excels in these three areas for sure.

I with that that round window that appears when you put your controller or headset through it could show the real world through it as an isolated window rather than just fading the whole screen in when your head is close.

"One possibility is that you are just very sensitive to distortion.  As I understand it, this cannot be entirely eliminated without eyetracking.  I've noticed it in every headset I've tried and could see it very easily in the Rift CV1 (but it was tolerable).  I've spent many hours modding facial interfaces and messing with adjustments but I could never eliminate it.  It's especially noticeable when looking at distant scenery or a detailed wall texture.  A properly dialed in Index has minimized it for me the most (of course it's not 100% eliminated) so if you know someone that has one you may want to try it and spend a good amount of time finding the optimal adjusment (e.g. if your eyes are deep set, use the lens depth adjustment to get the lenses as close to your eyes as possible).  
&amp;nbsp;  
There seems to be a wide range of sensitivities to this problem.  Some headsets e.g. the Samsung Odyssey and a Vive+GearVR lenses (modded in) apparently look fine for some people but to me they are like looking through fishbowls (normal Vive with an adjusted facial interface isn't so bad).  A scary thing is that (at least according to alan yates) distortion like this can even cause discomfort on a subconscious level.  That is, even if one is not able to notice the distortion it can still discomfort them.",oculus

I think what usually causes problems is the lack of bandwidth, and power to the headset. If you make sure you have those two things covered well, then your less likely to have a issue.

I knew someone that said that he went to the doc. And the doc said it was a fobia to changing quickly from place to place in this case realitys. Id say go check a doctor maybe is something in your head preventing your brain to get used to VR.,oculus

"The specs required for Link and for Rift S should be pretty similar. 

Since you're coming from a Go, I would guess that mobile VR matters to you a bit, so you might get some good mileage out of the Quest by itself too.

Personally, I have a Rift and a Quest and I'm not terribly happy with how heavy the Quest is on the front. I think it's a fantastic device for less than 1 hour sessions, but I plan on buying a Rift S on black friday.

If you plan on doing mostly PC gaming then I'd suggest trying the Rift S. That's my 2 cents, and take it with a grain of salt because I haven't actually used a Rift S yet. I've just read a lot of comparison reviews.",oculus
This same issue happened to me and that's what solved it,oculus

Run this and you'll get a window pop up that shows exactly what you can see on your headset (including system oculus menus).

Have you seen gaming PCs? They're just like... big colorful boxes nowadays. They're not smaller.,oculus

It really is bizarre, but thankfully not a huge issue. I did find it sightly nauseating after noticing it, but eventually I was able to ignore it. I would really like it patched out though.",oculus

"Oculus isn’t the only company in the VR market. I’m expecting major advances in console VR (though it’ll still likely be more expensive than PC VR), if nothing else, thanks to the impending release of the PS5 and Xbox Two.

#About This Game

Mona Lisa: Beyond the Glass is the first VR experience presented to the public
by the Louvre Museum and is conceived as part of the Museum’s seminal Leonardo
da Vinci exhibition which commemorates the 500th anniversary of the artist’s
death in France. Mona Lisa: Beyond the Glass reveals the latest scientific
research on da Vinci’s artistic innovation and his painting techniques and
processes through exceptional visualization in virtual reality, bringing them
to life.",oculus

Be warned the price is eye watering especially in Oz.

There are cheaper versions but the sound quality on them is ok for youtube etc. but I don't think you would like them for VR.

This is the exact point. Sim sickness is a scale. So for some people latency needs to be low. Others its ipd. For me its turning the camera.,oculus
What do you mean by turning the camera? You mean moving your head?,oculus
I got the same issue after the FW update. I needed to re-pair both controllers again using the oculus software’s guided setup. It’s working fine after pairing it again.,oculus
I am 2onder8ng what they changed. Would be very interesting. I tested it in beatsabet after the reinstall and I think they improved the ai prediction with the gyroscope but don't take my word for granted.,oculus
No advertisement here. I've been to San Francisco this year and there were ads everywhere,oculus
From cologne too. Let's play stormland together when Oculus link is released.,oculus
When the camera is moved without my head moving. Stick head turning. I play standing or on swival chair so i never have to use stick turning.,oculus
you are not using them correctly you doughnut!,oculus

"Ah ok yeah artificial locomotion and camera takeover / stick turn are huge issue for new and even a large number of experienced users. I’ve been doing VR since 2012 and I still have issues with artificial locomotion and camera take over. 

For me personally I can handle it better with better headsets so there’s hope that one day with a good enough headset I can handle just fine, but for now if I use an older headset(DK2, Rift, Vive) it’s still an issue like I’ve always had. For some reason with Index(And idk if it’s refresh rate, resolution, FOV or whatever) I can handle artificial loco and stick turn *a lot* better.",oculus
"Hey, far as I'm aware we haven't open-sourced the cable design to anyone, but my recommendation is reaching out here to see what options are available (if any): [https://support.oculus.com/885981024820727](https://support.oculus.com/885981024820727/)",oculus

"[This is what 2013 VR could look like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07IwxUD8N8E), it's really not that far away from what we have today. Resolution got a better and range now allows full room scale, but it's fundamentally still the same thing.",oculus
A 5 hours campaign followed by repetitive Destiny style gameplay isn’t really what the VR community were asking when we said that full AAA experiences were needed.,oculus
"Summary for those who dont want to watch the video:

2019 has been a big year for VR and the Video goes in to detail why I think it will be looked back on as a Landmark Year for Virtual Reality.

The video is split into 2 parts, Hardware and Software.

**Hardware** \- I go into a little detail about the past and why I think VR didnt take off as much as industry insiders expected. I then talk about the new headsets we have had launch this year

Oculus launched the Rift S and Quest in May, Valve launched the Index in June and HTC launched something called the cosmos no one gives a shit about.

We now have 3 new headsets that cater to different audiences and give more options with the quest an affordable option for people without a pS4 or Gaming PC, Rift S is priced well and easy to setup with inside out tracking and the Index for those with deeper pockets who want less compromises.

You also still have the PSVR which is the cheapest and most affordable of all of them if you have a PS4 already with them dropping to $200-250 on a regular basis.

Its now never been easier for someone to get in to VR gaming, the Quest is selling well and overall we have turned a corner in terms of accessability and ease of use while having a significant step forward in visual clarity and comfort.

**Software** \- Back in the beginning of Consumer VR the games were very basic with lots of short indie wave shooters and things that felt more like tech demos rather than the Fully Fleshed out VR games we want. Developers were playing it safe with lots of games using Teleportation movement, especially the exclusive stuff from Oculus and Sony.

Big AAA games take along time to develop with large teams of people working full time on them and cost alot of money. Only now after 3 years of Consumer VR are we starting to see the big games we have dreamt of like Asgards Wrath, Blood and Truth and Stormland with Iron Man VR, Medal of Honor and Lone Echo 2 on the Horizon. 

They are all exclusives but we are also seeing smaller indie developers really start to get to grip with VR game development with some of the earlier studios bringing out some next level games terms of scope and world interactions, Games like Boneworks, Walking Dead Saints and Sinners, Espire:1 etc and we have lots more games in the works that we know of and alot that will be announced next year.

Overall I think this has been a massive year for VR gaming with some big steps forward for both hardware and software, we also have the PS5 confirmed next year which will support the current PSVR plus loads more excellent games that feel like a generation forward.

Do people agree with me or am I just talking out of my Poo Pipe?",oculus
Alien Isolation did ran on DK1.,oculus
"The only thing I think that is holding back the link is the hardware.  I would assume that most people who purchased a Quest don't have a VR capable PC, that's why they got the Quest in the first place.  So in order to make use of the Link they'd need to have a VR ready PC.

So in this case yes, link will enhance the VRChat experience but only for those who can make use of the link.",oculus
"If Jedi was in VR and Stormland only flat, which one would you choose ? It wouldn’t even be a question. The VR part of Stormland doesn’t seem to compensate for the fact that JEDI is the better game overall (from reviews, I haven’t played them still). It hurts me to say this, but Jedi.",oculus
Thanks!,oculus
"Try a Rift S if you can.  If you can't then get your IPD measured.  You can do this yourself (google ""how to measure my IPD"").

Personally if your IPD falls within the range of the S or if you had good experiences with the Rift S regardless of your IPD then I'd say get it over the CV1.  No sensor setup, much sharper screen, more comfortable.",oculus
“Save VR chat”?  Oddly worded.... seems like you should have simply asked about the avatar and the link.,oculus
"Create a support ticket.  /u/OculusSupport

Click on their profile and select the support link.",oculus
Well I believe that the part that joins vrchat together is all the talent that goes into making the avatars. If you’re not able to see other people’s avatars it creates a boundary between you and the PC players. This ruins the experience but does not make unplayable in any way. It’s still a bit of a turn off to most vrchat players.,oculus

"Problem with that is, those are two separate things really if you think about it.

Having the guardian boundary show up during gameplay is good for safety. BEFORE you cross it. Just like a warning ""don't go too much that way"", or ""go back to the center position a bit"".

The peeking outside world is useful for doing stuff quickly outside of the game.

I agree we can already custom set the guardian and sensitivity. But separating the guardian wall from the camera wall would be a nice addition.",oculus

haha XD so funny take updoot haha,oculus
Same! That's why I'm here. Anything yet?,oculus
Seated position seems to raise this location uncomfortably high,oculus
"Rift s!  For the CV1 you need 3 sensors to get the same ability in term of roomscale. The sensors are a little pain in the a... in terms of installing them (on the room ceiling), you also need extension usb cables. Maybe you also need some extension for the two cv1 cables (usb/hdmi). All the stuff prop. needs an usb 3.0 extension card as the famous inatek cards. All that is not needed for the rift s - its an far more ""plug and play"" feeling. 

Then there is the resolution bumb which is higher due to the subpixel amount of the lcd screen. This comes without any perfomance probs cause of the 80 hz screen refresh - so the resolution upgrade is more or less free in terms of processing power needed. 

Bad thing on the rift s are the speakers - but there are easy solutions (headphones) or just use the mantis ones for psvr which fits also on the rift s (i have them, they are good).",oculus
"Does anyone know how to start a new game In Stormland? I am two hours in but now it works on the Index I just want to play it again from the beginning and I don't see I'm option for it, as soon as I launch the game it takes  me where I left off.",oculus

"90's or even 2000's PCs have 30-20 years apart from current ones, posts point that progress came in 5 years. So saying that is only supporting OPs point - 20 years of progress in 5.",oculus
Weird. I just upgraded from this exact setup. I ran my Valve index with this for awhile and everything was pretty smooth. Couldn’t do 120 but @90 everything was ok and playable on medium graphics some on high but there would be drops during intense things.,oculus
"Thanks a lot for that, I wanted to restart the game and I couldn't see how to.

Why is it so hard for devs to offer more than one save slot??",oculus
"It's not a simple question, you have to weigh you options.

1) is $150 a lot of money for you?

2) what is your IDP? this is very important because if you are way outside of the range for the Rift S the question answered itself

3) you have to consider the possibility of having the two most well known issues with the CV1 - breaking of the headphone cable and the lack of proprietary HDMI cable on stock if yours breaks. The latter is being dealt with by Oculus and there will probably be some in stock in the future, but for you it most probably means additional hassle and costs. For the headphone issue there are some DYI solutions out there

Realistically, if your IPD is fine for the Rift S than I'd probably go with that one. It's your decision though, if you think having a used product with the potential of having to deal with the issues listed above is worth the $150 saving than o for the CV1.",oculus

"If your focus ia mostly developing yes, Rift S would be better I believe.

A bit more screen clarity, slightly quicker response time, and pure dedicated direct connection, no streaming (Oculus Link is still streaming).

"Problem with foveated rendering is that it will likely require, at a minimum, close coordination with the entire hardware pipeline.

Expect a huge regression in compatibility/reliability following that, because it will be very disruptive to current rendering practices.

I've had less trouble connecting my Quest wirelessly to my PC than I've had with my wired Rift. I've played around with making things in Unity. I believe with a Quest you can develop games for either headset. I've not played with Unity enough to say if it would be better or worse to only have a Quest for developing. But I think it will work.,oculus

"There are apps and extensions such as BlenderXR that let you work in VR with your headset on. If the Quest Link supports those types of apps that would be great. Someone even posted this Maya extension that should let you work in VR with the headset on ...

If you'll do a lot of sitting at a computer to work, you may want to do that as comfortably as possible. For me, that's with the RIft S. You might research Oculus Quest comfort to read about that. That may influence your buying decision.

I never considered ""going through Android"" to be a Quest issue. I would wait until the Link comes out to make sure that everything you need to do will happen on the Quest Link. It should, but we haven't proven that.

There's no way I could sit for a long time and work with a Quest on when there's a more comfortable Rift S next to me. But as you note, you'll miss out on a lot of the Quest's benefits if you don't get one.

You may discover other non-gaming experiences that you might like -- experiences you could explore anywhere thanks to the Quest's mobility.  You might even find Steam VR apps that you could view successfully in the Quest via WiFi streaming. So imagine sitting in another room or in a chair far away from your computer and being able to view and work with those types of apps -- free from the confines a cable will impose.

I think it's such a hard decision for buyers because the Quest has so many useful features. But consider comfort if your primary goal is to sit in front of a computer for an extended amount of time.",oculus

"Nah.  It just looks like it's about 1 ""full generation"" behind, with DK2 being the prototype of the current ""full generation"".  It's a PS1 to PS2 jump.  I think we've still yet to see a PS3 jump to the 3rd full gen.  Index is pushing it, but that still feels like PS4 Pro vs PS4 situation.  Like a VR Gen 2 Pro model, while Pimax is... I dunno?  Some kind of weird Pro model as well?  Atari 2600 is so many full generations behind now, I'd say we'll be waiting another 5 years at least before the DK1 looks as dated.  Maybe more, with what currently feels like a slow burn of PC VR improvements.

IMHO, when we get foveated rendering unlocking the ability to push screens of at least several times higher res than we use now, with simultaneously notably wider FOVs (at least Index-wide), and maybe one other full new feature (hopefully varifocal lenses) then that will be a new Full Generation in my view.  After that, it'll be in maintaining (at least most of) those gains, but adding wireless, by building off the efficiency of foveated rendering.  Tethered option to available for both charging battery, and maximum data bandwidth.

After that?  Haptics, maybe?  I'd say we'll be in the iterative stage for a while though.  Steady evolution in the then-existing features, not revolution, at least for a while.  Maybe some fun developments with controllers and skeletal tracking. (though hand tracking should be here to stay already, and get better over time).",oculus

What's that background??,oculus
"Quad core may no longer be enough for future games. especially after the next gen consoles come out with 8 cores and we start getting those ports. Digital Foundry found that RDR2 performs better with more than 4 cores. 

For VR gaming right now? i5 might be enough but for the future who knows? I had a friend go from an i5 to a Ryzen 5 2600 and it helped his performance quite a bit. The system tasks in the background no longer makes his games hiccup for one example. Ryzen is in the same price ballpark. 

I'd recommend a Ryzen 5 3600 or 3600x on sale. Nvidia still rules VR performance (I think). So a used Gtx 1080 will be fine if bought at a good price. But I'd aim at 2070 and above- but it is your money. 16gb of ram should be the minimum. SSD is a must too. There you should be set. Don't cheap out on the power supply.",oculus

"First, I should note that I do not have any first-hand experience with this like I do with AWS - if you have, please correct me if I'm wrong about something.

It looks like Unity is pointing people towards Multiplay. On [their website](https://multiplay.com/services/) it looks like (for their cloud options where scaling is effective) they manage stuff on AWS and GCP, which come under their standard instance limits.

The thing is that no reasonably-priced cloud provider wants to deal with extremely elastic loads - if your physical servers are full during the day and only used at 20% capacity overnight you're wasting a lot of money.

Providers have various ways of mitigating this - for example, AWS EC2 has (IIRC) Reserved Instances where you pay half price when there is little server load, but your instances get shut down as soon as they need that capacity.

If they let you scale up to a huge number of servers for a few hours, and everyone was doing that, they'd have a huge amount of off-peak servers to either sell at half price or (in the extreme case if all the reserved instances are running) leave idle.",oculus

"Here is my opinion as posted elsewhere. Apologies to those who have seen it multiple times, but this topic gets posted several times a day. *We really need a sticky thread for it.*

*Oculus Link* turns the *Quest* into a *streaming PCVR* device, not a *native PCVR* device.

That means that the *Quest* is not *quite* as good for *PCVR* as the *Rift S* for multiple reasons:

* lower framerate - 72Hz
* smaller render target *(lower resolution video, said to even be lower than on CV1 but I cannot find an official source for this.)*
* mandatory *fixed foveated rendering* *(Really [ADDT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gocUADwqo8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=671), but I consider it a form of FFR because it prioritizes the center of the image, a pseudo fovea, over the edges of the image.)*
* capped 150Mbs video stream *(this may change but it will never match DisplayPort)*
* latency issues causing video artifacts, [*Sean Liu* from Oculus](https://youtu.be/K2zLneGGbk8?t=968)
* heavier
* one less tracking camera
* straps instead of halo *(subjective but makes a difference for long play sessions)*
* pentile  OLED *(subjective, but a lot of people think the Rifts S LCD is better for games)*

None of those are huge, but they add up especially, if you are looking for a PCVR focused device.

Don't take my word on it [here is what Carmack has to say about it](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1178332857909043201?s=20), and  [his comments about Beat Saber over Oculus Link](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1178721529741352960?s=20).

**Note:** If you have an IPD that is not supported by the *Rift S*, the physical IPD adjustment of the *Quest* can easily outweigh all of the items above, but if you don't need the physical IPD adjustment, I find it hard to believe that the *Quest* is the right choice for someone who is focused on *PCVR*.",oculus

"A 1080 ti is significantly faster than a 1080. The ti adds a lot in this case. I imagine that this really helps considering that asw kicks in as soon as you have no headroom left to stay above 90/80 fps on rift/rifts. 

So if OP gets close to 89 fps asw locks you at 45 fps and it does so really seamlessly. in this case you would still should have atleast 10 to 20 fps if not more headroom on a 1080 ti since its roughly 25% more powerful.

And asw  is really noticable in stormlands not so much for the visuals but the hand tracking gets really jittery.

My suggestion would be to turn off asw for stormlands to see if that fixes it , in addition to updating drivers ofc",oculus

Insomniac likely won't even bother getting the reviews or if they do they'll pay a marketing firm to aggregate them and they will brush it off as the noise unrelated to the game that it is. 

&gt; I'm pretty aware that games as a service require solid servers and if those are failing on day one then that means the game is less likely to be a strong service.

You'd be quite wrong. There's absolutely no correlation between temporary launch day issues and ongoing service problems. There's a strong correlation for game related bugs and half baked releases correlating to poor service, but ultimately that's not at all what is happening here. 

&gt; Nobody forced insomniac to create an always online experience.
Indeed. Everyone should shout from the roof that Insomniac is useless and screwed up a launch. Review the service. But giving bad reviews for the games doesn't help me, you, or anyone understand what they can expect. i.e. the review is now worthless.",oculus
"Hey there! If you haven't already, please [submit a ticket](https://support.oculus.com/885981024820727/) so we can help you with this.",oculus
"There was loads of hype. 

I think the campaign duration has just left a sour taste in a lot of people's mouths. Knowing Insomniac is now Sony owned too, we know what refinements, DLC to the game and a sequel is very unlikely. 

Until VR games consistently hit the 10-15 hour mark, I can't expect people to take them seriously.",oculus
"Not just that, but the bloody ammo counters flicking on and off on your hud as well. Was at the part where you're back in the start area going between the holograms of what had happened, trying to listen to the story, and all I could focus on was a blinking UI and rumbling controllers.

That aside though, I'm pretty disappointed with it. The combat just doesn't feel anything special, and the ability to get anywhere you want with very little effort takes away any sense of achievement as far as exploration goes.

I've actually put in a refund request for it.",oculus
"Decision is way easier if you’ve never played RDR2 before. Pick that up if you haven’t, it just recently came to PC.",oculus
"While there's been hype, it certainly seems to be dying off way quicker than for Asgard's. That seemed to overtake the sub for a week or more. Right now, there are a few Stormland posts on the front page whereas with AW it pretty much took over.

Saying that, I think it's a reflection of how much better AW was than Stormland imo.",oculus
I get motion sick pretty easy in VR. Stormland is causing me no problems.,oculus
It also possibly because you move the fastest on the clouds when there's very little around you so there's not too much fast movement in your peripheral vision.,oculus
Asgard's Wrath. It's not even close for me having played both.,oculus
"If you get a rift S, you won't be able to play certain games simultaneously.  Like creed, quest players can only play with other quest players.  Pavlov, quest players can only play with questers.  That is unless you are planning to buy 2 pcs.  Sure your wife only plays best saber but whst about when friends come over.

Note, most games, you need to buy a second copy to play simultaneously with just a few exceptions like racket nx and rec room.",oculus
I think you'll have an easier time finding other people to play stormland with you later.  So I'd pick up asgards wrath first.,oculus
"It started with the devs and oculus not marketing as much.  That makes a difference.  We saw preview clips for a long time with asgards wrath.  

Then, I feel asgards wrath was more complicated to play so people had to come here and ask more questions.

Finally, the reviews are more mixed with stormland and people probably have emptied their pockets already with both pistol whip and asgards wrath so less people buying now.",oculus
"If you are looking to get the most out of your $ i would go with AW. (Played more than 65 hours already)
If you are looking for some fps game to play with a friend then Stormland would be the better choice.",oculus
"Still stuck on ""Pre-Ordered""... Day 3 and counting. Great launch.",oculus
"That's a good idea. Will do, but I still can't fix the kink in the cable now. Have you got any suggestions?",oculus
"The thing for creating turbulence on the clouds and jump ? You can use it to shock enemies ? haha, didn't know.

I was confused because I had it on the right hand ...",oculus
"I think it's quite good.  There's a good variety of challenges with different types of holds (technical, sharp, temporary, etc.) and different paths through levels.  There's a bunch of different environments and they're all interesting.  It's also decent exercise.",oculus
The new updated did not do that to mine. It actually improved some things like less frame drops now.,oculus
"I think the surfing system is awesome, id actually like to see more games use it ( although it would be a very specific use case )",oculus
What the hell is your problem.,oculus
... how could Gorn possibly make you sick??!,oculus
No coop. I'll try shield then grab,oculus
"I think it's because of the locomotion, it's the best part of the game, for some people like me it's better than Asgard because of that, but if you don't like crazy locomotion on VR, then you'll miss the best part of the game.",oculus
TBH I'm still busy playing AW :D.,oculus
"yup, I did. multiple times in this past week.",oculus
"I love both, it's a question of personal taste.

What do you prefer, a long RPG with not much locomotion, or a looter shooter based con crazy locomotion, that it's replayability beyond 10 hours consists on taking on similar levels with a different aproach, bacause so many aproaches are posible with that locomotion: Run, Jump, glide, fly, climb",oculus
"I'll try it, thank you!",oculus
"2060 will run VR games fine, I use a 1060 6gb and it runs most games well",oculus
"Custom models have to be quest enabled to be seen on quest, I think you do it before uploading it to vrchat",oculus
Clmib,oculus
I ran on a 1060 3gb and was happy.,oculus
"Their reviews on Steam are very bad, much worse than 2 years ago, now prople prefer VR Chat.

I'd hazard a guess that, amidst all of the dumb stuff that happened at launch, myself and maybe you as well, failed to get our keys properly registered, so our games appear to be fraudulent. I didn't do the log search until after 5pm, so it'll be a few more hours until morning when somebody looks over my results and gives me some useful feedback. But I bet they have to do something internally. Oculus will likely have to re-register the game to me and my account. There's likely nothing I can do on my end to fix this.",oculus
I have a Rift headset and love Quill. If you're sharing the project file I'd very much like to see it in Quill myself.,oculus
"No, the turbulences is a different thing. You used the shock arm to power up the movement station in the very first cloud layer, way way before that.",oculus
Really shit.. mine was fixed @ 8:30 lastnight,oculus
For what the Rift S is intended for (a dedicated PCVR HMD) it is still better than the Quest for its intended use case at the same price point. Its specs are better than the quest for PCVR gaming. If a customer wants the superior PCVR headset and doesn't care about the mobility factor the Rift S comes out ahead. Rift S vs Index argument doesn't make sense either. The Rift S is a cheaper option because it's technically inferior. It's not a better headset because it's cheaper and the Index isn't an obsolete HMD because it's more expensive. It's like saying desktop PCs are obsolete because laptops are mobile and can run eGPUs. Just because the laptop can hook up a GPU in an enclosure doesn't make it as powerful as a desktop PC with an equivalent dedicated GPU. The Quest will not provide an equivalent PCVR experience to what the Rift S can. Both headsets will have their own share of the market.,oculus
Coming out after Asgard's Wrath can't have helped and it doesn't make as strong an initial impression. I'm also worried it might end up being a live service game without the service.,oculus
Physics is the reason I'm interested in boneworks. Please drop me a list of interesting titles with the same level of interaction,oculus
"Yeah, I remeber now ... I totally forgot about it, thanks xD",oculus
"I have a gtx 1070 and it runs most vr games fine although struggles a little bit  on higher details in stormlands and AW. The 2060 is stronger than a 1070 so you should be fine.

However one thing to note is that the 2060 Super is better than the 2060 by a decent amount. A 2060 Super is really close to a 2070 and i believe it's worth the price difference which isn't too steep.

There is also the rx 5700 xt from amd which in my opinion has a great price for it's performance and beats the 2060 super in performance.

So the 2060 will be perfectly fine but i would pay a little more for either the 2060 super or rx 5700 xt.

Btw you might already be talking about the 2060 super since the normal 2060 only has 6gb of ram to my knowledge",oculus
"Yeah, I never remember I have it, or the shield either. It's quicker for me to just pick things off with the sniper rifle and then shoot the rest of them in the face with an smg alongside the health absorb perk. No need to block or disable them.",oculus

"The bad news is, you'll need to have a bootcamp partition and spend some time in windows but it seems that even the lowest model GPU is good enough to VR, so, yes, there's no difference with any other pc in this aspect.

"&gt; There's enough stress for them in the VR to ask them for more updates. But surely I can blame big pocket studios.

Why not the other way around

At least some Indie VR games must be turing a profit.

On the other hand, I'm *highly* skeptical that any of Oculus's exclusves are making money.

Why, exactly, should the organisations loosing the most money be held to a higher standard in this regard than indies?",oculus
"I'm not even sure about that, but crossbuy is only true for **fully** funded games, i.e. games published by Oculus Studios.",oculus
"I think AW definitely had a larger community presence up to release with all their highlight reels. Stormland had their interviews and cypher logs in the weeks coming up to release but there wasn't much in terms of new content in regards to gameplay 

Also I think AW was a much bigger surprise- I didn't have a lot in Sanzaru based on their previous titles for Oculus, and they seemingly knocked out of the park with AW, and it got a lot of people hyped up post launch I think 

With stormland, I expected a lot more from insomniac. Not in terms of content or scale, although content wise it's pretty small, but in terms of polish and finesse, and ultimately the game feels quite broken in a few places, at least for me- especially as I broke two missions within 90 minutes of play.",oculus

3. No, your pc is too slow for S. Overall, S is the best in its price range.",oculus
"Since this is Oculus subreddit, I think it's reasonable to ask opinnions of the tethered and untethered version. By taking a look at points made by Quest lovers vs Rift lovers, you can flesh out your take on which one might suit your personal situation.

If i were op, i would try to wait until Oculus Link comes out and check it out. If it provides a good enough tethered experience (quality-wise), then I would personally go for Quest. Coop chance with mobile headsets would be so awesome with friends. And the pcvr experience with ALVR or VD seems to be awesome too. Wireless pcvr has so much potential, that I'm personally planning to get my first gaming pc when Oculus steps up the game with their take on the wireless pcvr with their first party solution.",oculus

They still seem kinda off though, if you make them tight it shifts your hand slightly from a normal grip with your fingers aligned to the triggers. Im using them slightly loose and it seems to be working ok, though I'm considering trying the amvr grips that have extra grip as well as the back hand strap. Though I don't know if they would be any different.",oculus

Regarding crossbuy being only for Oculus Studios games, That doesn't seem to be true. There are plenty of games on the Crossbuy list which are not full Oculus Studios games. (Thrill of the Fight, Apollo 11, The Exorcist VR etc.)

"Good point. As indies tend to be just a little team with very little money (and therefore selling expectations), I don't like the idea to push them very hard. Of course, there are games and games. If the narrative is the key for your game, those who doesn't speak the selected narrative language will be completely lost.   
It's -maybe- a culture thing. There are 3-4 big languages spoken across the world. If you begin the game with locatization in mind, willing to give subs or dubbed voices, then, eventually, you could end up adding all of them. If you start the developing process without any intention to locale the game, then you have done clearly a statement (for whatever reason you could have).  
  
My point here is: whether localization of a game should be a ""feature"" or a ""base"" for any game who wants to sell internationally. Add VR strange ecosystem as a barrier for non-english spoken users to the equation.",oculus

"Why would it? It's literally a fraction of Asgard's Wrath, in terms of content and mechanics. 

A month before AW, I was excited for Stormland more than AW. But when it came out that the ""campaign"" (which is really a tutorial and not a campaign at all) is a few hours long, and there's just a copy-pasted Ubisoft grind after that, without even any decent boss fights or unique loot? All hype died. I am hesitant to call it a tech demo, because it's such a loaded statement in context of VR, but to me it IS bordering on a tech demo. It's not, but it's borderline. They took a few steps beyond it, so that it isn't a tech demo, but if they turn around they can still easily piss back over the line. It's a pissing-range tech demo.

Also, unrelated to game itself, but Stormland was sandwiched between Red Dead Redemption 2 a week before, and Jedi Fallen Order a day later. That's a pretty serious bit of competition.",oculus
"People are selling them cheap for a reason. If the headset breaks, it becomes a paperweight. No replacement cables. They have stopped making the cable that goes to the headset.",oculus
"If you cannot setup the sensors permanently i personally would not bother with the cv1. The Software setup of the sensors doesn't take long but having to physically removing them when you are done and placing them again when you want to play seems really off turning.

I would just get the rift s in that case it also offers a significantly clearer picture over the cv1 which is well worth the additional cost in my opinion especially combined with the easier setup. In addition you don't need 4 usb ports for the rifts wheras a cv1 with 3 sensors wants three usb 3 ports and one usb 2 or 3 port. So the rift s is less demanding on a good motherboard with good usb controllers.",oculus
"Aside from the older racers that run flawlessly, the VR, frame rate, clarity combo beats the other major players like Pc2 and Competizione.

Codemasters fixed all round Oculus or SteamVR it's flawless. Hard calling it the VR game of the year because it's just a sim, but it's the one I've had most fun playing.",oculus
"dude if u want my honest opinion:
 RIFT S or no Oculus at all, CV1 is a hassle and the experience is nowhere near Rift S level..

Also with RIFT S you can play room scale games learning you can actually physically move around in the game while walking in the real world.. 

It will be cheap on BLACK friday so go for it, best set u could get for a First one.",oculus
"Won't work for VR, as this system is based on the glasses reacting to real world movement, not simulated or virtual movement as in VR.",oculus

That’s 50 bucks for 2 maybe if you’re lucky, 3 games. Yes. Grab the Rift S on sale during Black Friday. But be cautious if you go into a store!",oculus
Yes we do.,oculus
"Asgard's Wrath by a mile. Stormland doesn't even come close. Its biggest strength is movement, but this gets old after a few hours. Combat is really bland, and doesn't feel particularly good. Enemy variety is lacking. No boss battles that I know of. The campaign is a few hours long, and is more of a tutorial than an actual campaign, you spend a few hours just running around unlocking things like the ability to look at your map or the ability to sprint and jump and climb. And after that it's grind baby grind. Except there's no reason to grind - there's no unique loot, no unique cosmetics, no unique upgrades, no interesting boss fights. It's just an endless, pointless loop.

Go with Asgard. There's different characters, a dozen unique pets, each with a unique ability, there's a story, there's many boss fights and arena challenges, etc., etc. 

The two are just in no way comparable. Asgard is an actual game. Stormland is a magnificent tech demo that should properly be a year away from release while they add some actual features and content.",oculus
"As a user of both the Cv1 and the S, I would say stay clear form the cv1 if you're going to have to set it up every time you play. You won't necessarily have to recalibrate every time but you'll risk poor tracking of you don't. The extension cables have to be of good quality and have a limit to length. I think it somewhere around 14 feet for the sensors and 3 feet for the hmd (not positive on those numbers). Also, the built in headphones have a common issue of dieing from the head strap being tugged on when putting on/taking off he head mounted display (hmd).

The room calibration on the cv1 can take time. I would struggle, sometimes for 15 minutes trying to get everything set up.

The S is easier to use, the image is drastically more clear than the cv1. Setup is super easy, plus, with passthrough, you don't need to remove it to see around you. Also uses three fewer USB ports. Imo, it is far better than the cv1 and with your situation, would be the better choice. The bad of the S is that the external speakers are the equivalent of a cellphone speaker. However, the S has a headphone plug on the unit, so you can wear headphones and not worry about dragging that extra cable around.",oculus

wow.,oculus
"The $350 sale is from Lenovo, make sure to check the cashback sites to see if there are any offers there as well. Lenovo often does 10-12% cash back so that's another $30-40 bucks. Got my cash back before my Rift when I bought it.",oculus

$349 will probably be the official Black Friday deal.,oculus
"Best case scenario, you'd have to manually keep track of save folder for each user and copy-paste the saves. Worst case, the game uses cloud storage and even removing the save directory won't reset the game's progress, it'll just restore it from cloud. There certainly is not a built-in choice in the main menu like Asgard's Wrath with its 5 (iirc?) distinct save slots.",oculus
"and this, if something happens it makes it non-usable.

Rift S can be fixed and you would have 2 years of that SWEET Warranty aswell.",oculus
And how do they work with the CV1??? I was about to order a couple of Mamut since they're for both versions of controllers,oculus
"Well that depends on whether you need guardian. I gave up on it and now when I move the sensor, I just click reset tracking and that's all. Doesn't take more than 5 sec.

Nonetheless I agree that if he can afford rift s, it's a better option. Screen &amp; lenses are better there. Plus that you can't replace the cable on CV1...",oculus
"Absolutely NO ONE knows because the product isn't released yet. There will be some CPU overhead for compressing the frames and pushing them out over USB. The images themselves need to be foveated to reduce the resolution around the corners. Plus each frame is lower resolution than the default Quest resolution if I recall so there's some math to be done in a few places. No one knows if you are going to be able to supersample an image over the link cable (I can't imagine how you would) which means most high end cards are likely, but not certainly, to be overkill by a huge margin.",oculus
/r/oddlysatisfying,oculus
All your needs and desires are met.,oculus
"&gt;This time for stormland there is no hype ?

Watch the trailers. It LOOKS like any other shooter. Why? Because, it is, ultimately just yet another shooter.",oculus
"Ooof. No. Nobody wants a tethered Rift S. Everybody wants Rift S experience with Quest's mobility. It's just reconciling the two, at a decent price, is what's slowing things down. Both are working towards the same goal - fully untethered, free-range VR, they're just approaching it from the different ends of the spectrum. Rift S is coming at it from tethered end, with the potential of WiFi dongle eliminating the cable later, and Quest is approaching it from the self-contained angle. Which, quite frankly, I think ultimately is a dead end, as there's only so much hardware you can stuff into a self-contained headset before you are balancing a full PC on top of your head.",oculus
"I was trying to get the key for the Rift version revoked and get a new one for the Quest as I no longer use my rift and found this out.  


I was under the impression the Link cable itself was going to be released in November so I guess this is a heads up to anyone else that got mistaken like me.",oculus
"But there are so few actually good ones for VR.
Even for standard gaming, classic shooters are exceedingly rare nowadays.",oculus
"This may well be. But I was disappointed as Stormland was touted as some crazy new Openworld game. I personally expected a totally different type of game, not a shooter.",oculus
"well and the fact that they're not blue tooth, there's no software accompanying them so you can't change any settings.
And you can only use them with your the very large USB drive stick.",oculus
"I expected more and better shooting, like Robo Recall quality, but it’s very interspersed. Meh.",oculus
If youre using OBS there is a plugin that shows you exactly how it looks like in VR,oculus
"Ok, still a potential that some third party cable may work with the link! Isn't it the reason why their releasing the software first!",oculus
"Yeah I'm pretty sure the third party cable's will work but from the marketing I had seen before I thought the cable itself would be available in November not just the software.  


Wanted to make sure others didnt make the same mistake. I will look into some 3rd party options",oculus
"Yeah they said from the start the cable wasn’t going to be ready for the link release. 

Honestly this is going to be a messy launch for Link and I think they should just wait for the cable to be ready before they launch it or better yet scrap the cable idea and make it a wireless dongle. As virtual desktop has already shown it can be done really well wirelessly and that doesn’t even use a dedicated dongle. 

The idea of teathering my link to a computer really doesn’t appeal to me and is a misstep backward for Oculus.",oculus
Holy shit this game looks awesome,oculus
"I don't think I saw anything about the cable in November. It was the software, in beta form, that was going to launch. And as others have mentioned, any cable will do, the link cable will just do better.",oculus
That worked!!! Thank you so much,oculus

"Some quick clips of the new breaching charges in Crunch Element (Oculus supported!)

Crunch Element is a physics-centered VR infiltration game where the player can siege compounds in whatever play style suits them. Whether that’s scaling walls quietly with a suppressed pistol taking the roof entrance, or using a breaching charge as a hole-puncher-for-walls with a sawed-off on the hip, Crunch Element’s goal is to give the player as much freedom as possible and allow them to express themselves through whatever play style suits them. Many of these play styles are complemented by the flagship mechanic of destructible walls, doors, and floors. My goal is to include the community in the development process as much as possible by allowing early hands-on testing and considering player feedback at every step of the way.

"Asgards has more content, more unique gameplay elements (from mortal to god and back, animal companions) and came out before the flurry of holiday quarter releases all started to drop.  Stormland looks cool but not that unique, and every clip I watch of ppl playing it looks the same, and like a lot of other games.  Personally, I'm just still playing AW (and have multiple other games on back burner) so I can wait for stormland to be discounted and updated.",oculus
"Yeah but the video output will be inferior as hardware limitations.
Still the TI is still a bit overkill even for the rift s",oculus
I'm asking my self the same thing,oculus
"The format of your play sessions matters here. You say you don't play often, does that mean you have long sittings (2-3 hrs at a stretch) but once or twice a week, or many short sessions, of 30 mins or less?

The reason I ask is that in Stormland, when you fire it up, you load in at the base. And it can take you literally 10 mins just traveling to get back to what you were doing before you logged off. The game has zero respect for player time, and is passed to all hell with needless travel. Imagine a fragmentation grenade. You hold it in your hand, and it's small, and you can quickly and easily touch every piece of it. Now imagine it explodes in a room. How easy is it to touch each piece now? How long does it take? Much longer now, because some pieces are embedded in the floor, others in the ceiling, it'll take you hours to find and touch every piece. That's world design on Stormland, an exploded grenade. Doesn't make it any bigger, it's still a fist-sized object, it's just been exploded over ""clouds"", which is basically amorphous white nothing, that you  have to travel through, wasting time. 

So, based on world design alone, I already wouldn't recommend Stormland to a casual player, the game has too many needless time sinks between short bursts of actual content. And actual content is repetitive in Ubisoft fashion. Have you played Far Cry, with copy-pasted bases sprinkled all over? Or Assassin's Creeds, with gang hideouts, forts, etc, that you capture, over and over, for no apparent reason? That's basically Stormland in its entirety. 

As far as the story, there is almost none. It's a glorified tutorial. It'll take you 2 hrs of running around just to unlock the ability to climb, open your map, sprint, etc. You'll get some glimpses of other robots, but not much. And very little character building or story. If you're expecting something of any depth, sci-fi style, on the same level as Mass Effect or even Anthem, this game doesn't get there. And after this 4-5 hr tutorial, that's pretty much it. It's just grind baby grind. 

Now, is Stormland a bad game? No. It has its strengths, and for the right player, with the right mindset, it totally works. For me, Stormland is basically No Man's Sky, if you strip out survival elements, inventory management, trading, industry, spaceships, space combat, wormholes, freighters, base building, submarines and underwater content, animal husbandry and multiplayer communal hub and events. But in exchange you get better traversal, better combat, and more weapons. It's basically No Man's Sky but you're trapped on one planet, with no way out, and all you do is kill.

And then there's Asgard's Wrath, with \~15-20 hrs of actual story. Yes, it's fairly simple and campy, but at least it's there. It too has a lengthy beginning where first hour is just a tutorial, but beyond that it opens up. You get multiple heroes, multiple pets (about a dozen, with unique abilities), decent combat (you have to dodge red attacks, and parry blue attacks, that kind of thing). It has actual honest-to-god boss fights that feel interesting. It has tons of puzzles, though not particularly complex. It has arenas to fight NPCs in for fame and glory, and dungeons to crawl through for loot. It's a full fledged game.

For me personally, Asgard just feels better. It allows multiple saves, Stormland does not. It respects my time by not padding the  game with forced travel, Stormland does not. It allows me to adjust difficulty at the beginning or at any time, Stormland does not (you have to grind your way through copy-pasted content, TWICE, to set the game to highest difficulty, and then if you don't keep on doing it, difficulty will drop, by itself, after 2 weeks, and you have to do it again). It's about respect to the player. Asgard affords you every courtesy, Stormland assumes you're a brainless peasant who can't hit the broad side of a barn with a howitzer from 5 feet away.

But having said all that, Stormland has...something. Which is why I haven't refunded it. It's probably the closest I came in feeling like playing a druid in WoW, where you'd be sprinting across the hills in cheetah form, jump off a cliff, turn into a bird and glide, then turn into a bear and bear-drop on an unsuspecting mob, kill it, jump into a lake, turn into a seal and swim away. That sensation of absolute freedom is hard to come by. And that's what Stormland has in spades. 

It's also the kind of game where you don't need your brain to be on at all times. In Asgard, you need to pay attention, unless playing on Easy. You have to be aware when to dodge, when to block, when to parry. Stormland doesn't require you to plan your approach too much. As long as you don't stand in the open, in the middle of the base, and open fire, you'll be find. Most semi-sensible approaches will work. Which, after a hard day, can be beneficial. If you feel mentally spent and just feel like shooting some robots in the face with pump-action shotgun while screaming ""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!"", this game works fairly well.

Bottom line, if I had to have one game, to play for the rest of my life, and it was between Asgard and Stormland, it would be Asgard without even a tiny hesitation. It's a full game, full of content. But Stormland has its own charm - it's a sandboxy world to run around in, it's very accessible, the mechanics are very simple. You just hop in, kill some things, hop out. But there's really no driving force behind it - you don't get any special loot, unique weapons, etc., it's just killing for killing sake, on a timer.",oculus

But like I said, VR seems to have to many downsides for to many people to really be worth as much as a game console that offers a similar good expierence to them. That a crucial point to have Vr success. Some people might buy into Vr as a secondary thing, sure, but that’s not the mainstream. Just like the mainstream is not going to buy a Xbox one and PS4 and so on. That’s just the core gamers.",oculus

"Yeah, I rag on Stormland a lot, it's really disappointing compared to what it could/should have been had they put in more thought and effort. But at the same time, it's not a game I would suggest anyone skip outright. Maybe don't get it now, but a bit later, especially if it goes on sale. It's like if you had to pick between Gorn and Until You Fall. Both are good, solid games. Both have strengths and weaknesses. But Until You Fall just has so much more depth, complexity and polish that given a choice between just those two, the choice is obvious. But I still had many hours of fun in Gorn, and don't feel like they were wasted. 

And yeah, I'd be surprised if AW went on sale any time soon. BUT, Black Friday/Cyber Monday is literally 2 weeks away. If it does go on sale, it'll be then. If it doesn't, it'll be safe to assume it'll be a solid 6 months at least until it does. It just depends on how much you're hurting right now, because it won't be 50% off or anything, we'll be lucky to see 15-25%, which, with $40 price tag, is literally $6-10 that you'll save.",oculus

"What really gets me is that all the actions done by the bottom trigger basically call happen in the same spot as your body. Trying to grab a fruit, I grab my gun or the floor and start climbing horizontally. The holsters being super sensitive also means that in the heat of the moment I accidentally put my sniper in my hip rather than my shoulder, and half way mid battle when swapping out the smg for a shotgun I realize I just threw my rifle on the floor somewhere- it'd be nicer if it was like Artika 1's holster system where you hold the weapon next to the spot for a bit until it registers, then it will always go back to that spot when you let go. 

Maybe they were thinking you'd swap guns often in combat, but I've never felt the need, and if I want to use an enemy's gun, I can just pick it up and not holster it anyway.

Regarding jump, I bought the charge jump early on and felt ripped off when I realized you can just grab the floor and throw yourself, much much quicker too as the charge needs you to hop once first, then wait 5 seconds for chsrgingm",oculus
Looking good!,oculus
"Agreed. I was(and still am) a fierce critic - not only about the initial non-VR inclusion, but the _whole_ debacle of the split VR launch, how Oculus Store buyers apparently got boned with no DLC(not sure if this is still the case), how the initial VR on Steam roll-out was piss poor performance-wise(it’s still hard to record the out-of-VR aspects satisfactorily), and other shady practices.

If it was two games with the same license and similar budgets I doubt anyone here would be giving Fallen Order much consideration.

That said I don't think you even need to make it harder to register guns, just only make it possible to register them to an empty slot. If I want to swap a gun out I'll tear the old gun up anyway. As it stands you can be hovering about firing weapons and accidentally just throw one of your other weapons away and then it is just gone, you aren't getting it back from the floor 200 feet away. I also had the exact same experience buying charge jump though I initially felt shortchanged as it took just that long to charge I'd hardly ever use it, and even worse when I realised flinging yourself from the floor is just way better than jumping.",oculus

"I think it would immediately tell you when you tried to submit it if you were disqualified from either too much time played, or too long time passed since you purchased it. The only catch is that you can't uninstall, apparently, before you try to refund. At least that's what I heard. 

I didn't mind the mobility at all, but there has to be A POINT to all of this, and there isn't one. Like, in early Assassin's Creeds (which themselves were spawned by Prince of Persia reboot, also by Ubisoft, which began a decade earlier by the original Prince of Persia 1 &amp; 2 by Broderbund Software), if you botched a climb, you fell to your death. The climb wasn't a given, it was a bit of a challenge, and a bit of a puzzle, sometimes you had to climb down and sideways to find more handholds to continue to go up. All of this is lacking in Stormland, you can't die from traversal no matter how hard you try. Which makes the whole thing trivial. There aren't enemies that require you to traverse. It's helpful, but not mandatory. And since the game lacks any kind of special loot, there's little point to go exploring. 

What I mean is, when I find a chest in Borderlands, I'm EXCITED! There could be anything in there. When I'm exploring in Skyrim, I know there's always a chance I'll find a named item there, or even a daedric artifact (named unique). But when I find a chest at the top of the building in Stormland, it's like...who gives a shit? I open it, there's an SMG and a shotgun. And? Is that it? Fine, I rip them apart for mats/ammo, and move on. If I'm good on both, I wouldn't even bother opening the chest. That is such a monumental flaw in an allegedly exploration game it gives me a headache just thinking about it.",oculus

Other than that I think Asgard's Wrath seems like a much more varied game, with different things to do and a much better story. Not to mention the entire Norse mythology theme is very appealing to me. Maybe it's just because I am from a Nordic country, but I always felt the Norse gods are the coolest B)

The first song of the [teaser soundtrack](https://soundcloud.com/robwestwood/sets/asgards-wrath-teaser-soundtrack/s-kIN5l) really makes me excited to play it. Maybe listening to it will make your decision easier ;)",oculus
I will be looking for this game.,oculus
"&gt;Compared to the awe i was playing AW and the complexity of it, the more i play stormland i just feel more and more ripped off.

Can't say I agree at all. Stormland is unique and very much the opposite of a rip-off

&gt;Feels more like Robo Recall with the option for free roam than a full standalone game.

With RR still being one of the best things in the space... that sounds kind of amazing as a pitch, whatever ""than .... full standalone"" is supposed to mean, although I can't say this assessment makes a whole lot of sense. The two games couldn't be more different.

&gt;It really gives a feeling that the game just reset itself and you need to start from scratch

That's the premise of all these games though. Be it Diablo or anything else with a NG+ (ever played Ratchet and Clank?), why would you not knock the player down and make the game more difficult? Blasting through things without effort is kind of annoying, to be honest.

&gt;AW and the complexity of it

Hey, I like AW, but let's not pretend like it's particularly complex or anything.

&gt;For everyone who were yet to buy this title, wait for a discount as the 40$ just NOT worth it.

Yeah nah, buy it, refunding is always an option if you really can't stand the game, but it's so worth the money if you're into exploration, amazing design... all the things we have been waiting for in a VR game, to be honest. It's incredibly atmospheric and 40 bucks is no price at all for something of that caliber.

"I purposefully *didn't* take wed last week off for RDR2's PC launch, because I assume launch days are always a joke. I was right! The game was a mess on launch. They got it to working around Friday and I was able to play it all weekend. 

So... I had some personal days to burn so I thought I'd treat myself and stay home on Monday and play the *hell* out of RDR2 and just be a fuckin cowboy, right?

Rockstar pushed a patch through Sunday night that fucked my game and made it impossible to launch all day.

Fuck",oculus
"You're right.  Their inexperience hasn't taught them to expect launch day bugs and problems yet.   

That doesn't delegitimize their reviews at all though.  I honestly think that companies as big as insomniac don't have anything to cry about if they upset a few die hard fans with a fumbled launch.   They deserve those very few 1 star reviews.  Not that big of a deal and maybe it'll teach these businesses to plan for launch day better.   It's been far to long that i have to expect these big companies to have shitty launches.",oculus
"Rumors say no Quest deal for Black Friday. Then again, it’s only 2 weeks away.",oculus
"&gt; Gameplay isn't bad, but it's not shockingly great either

It's very much leaning towards the great side imho. Traversal is top-notch, gunplay is really fun, upgrades are sensible and make for great progress... it's pretty darn good I say and slipstreaming is a reaction-based racing game in and of itself.

The only thing I wish people did was play Sairento. Goddamnit am I mad that people don't take Sairento as a template for 80% of the shooters out there, because the jumping mechanic overshadows anything most conventional games are going for. You won't dynamically climb around your enemies in Stormlands for the most part because handling weapons prevents you from doing too many other things and I really wish I could just arc away someplace else.

Still, really great game.",oculus
If it's not an event for you that's fine.  Many people hype themselves up about launch and there isn't anything wrong with that.,oculus

It may be your new video card just doesn't handle the length as well. Had the same problem with the same cable when I went from a 980ti to a 1080ti. I just added a 4k hdmi repeater (like 10 bucks on amazon). Keep in mind you will need either a Male to male connector to hook it to the insignia extension or a small hdmi jumper. The repeaters are single direction signal flow so make sure you hook it up correctly but it should take care of you issue.,oculus

For all they know, this was the same thing as many other AAA studio launches of the past few years, where launch day connectivity issues persist for weeks.  Why shouldn't they offer a bad review ?

"&gt;	360 videos on Youtube show a lot of creativity and enthusiasm, but one problem difficult to look past is the actual resolution and lack of 3D in many of them. If they can find a way to improve the resolution and streaming quality of these 360 vids and add 3D, that would be a huge jump in immersion.

This was something Carmack painstakingly worked on, he brought this up specifically in fact at OC6 (he first talked about fixing 360 video in OC3 and OC4). 

He hammered out a perfectly optimized 360 video framework that allowed for a locked 60FPS experience without the frame drops common in video, and supported full **5K** resolution video rendered to the GearVR and Oculus Go’s full 1440p screen resolution (instead of the 1280x1280 eye box games had to use) by tapping deep into the Qualcomm video processor and using these viewport regions to max out the capability - all at a really high bitrate and in true 3D. He did all of this work and showcased it with the Henry 360 video you can download on GearVR and Go, then released the full source code so anybody can use it. 

And... nobody used it. A Full 3D, high res, high bitrate, zero frameskip 360 video framework is out there free to use and it landed like a fart in the wind. He mentioned at OC6 how disappointed he was by that, among a number of other things he did that nobody else bothered to use. (such as timewarp layers for super crisp text) 

Kinda goes to my original point above. He obsessed over aspects of VR he felt needed serious attention like 360 video and text rendering and web rendering - but it was never adopted once he released the work. I have to imagine, and his was backed up by the overall somber tone of his OC6 keynote, that it all began to weigh on him. He got the core essentials in place that allow VR to work on mobile chips at all and it now underpins Go/Quest, but everything else he’s tried to push the fluidity and immersion of the experience has largely gone un-utilized and ignored. At some point anybody of his skill will say “time to move onto something else”.",oculus

Then there are some systems like the map system that are straight up the best VR implementations of such ive ever seen. The map and compass feel so intuitive and simple to the point that its surprising no other game has really done something like this. 

I don't think its a system seller on its own but it definitely sets a few standards for certain VR mechanics and couples with Asgards Wrath just builds on the collection of worthwhile titles.",oculus

"Here is my opinion as posted elsewhere. Apologies to those who have seen it multiple times, but this topic ***gets posted several times a day***. *We really need a sticky thread for it.*

*Oculus Link* turns the *Quest* into a *streaming PCVR* device, not a *native PCVR* device.

That means that the *Quest* is not *quite* as good for *PCVR* as the *Rift S* for multiple reasons:

* lower framerate - 72Hz
* smaller render target *(lower resolution video, said to even be lower than on CV1 but I cannot find an official source for this.)*
* mandatory *fixed foveated rendering* *(Really [ADDT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gocUADwqo8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=671), but I consider it a form of FFR because it prioritizes the center of the image, a pseudo fovea, over the edges of the image.)*
* capped 150Mbs video stream *(this may change but it will never match DisplayPort)*
* latency issues causing video artifacts, [*Sean Liu* from Oculus](https://youtu.be/K2zLneGGbk8?t=968)
* heavier
* one less tracking camera
* straps instead of halo *(subjective but makes a difference for long play sessions)*
* pentile  OLED *(subjective, but a lot of people think the Rifts S LCD is better for games)*

None of those are huge, but they add up especially, if you are looking for a PCVR focused device.

Don't take my word on it [here is what Carmack has to say about it](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1178332857909043201?s=20), and  [his comments about Beat Saber over Oculus Link](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1178721529741352960?s=20).

**Note:** If you have an IPD that is not supported by the *Rift S*, the physical IPD adjustment of the *Quest* can easily outweigh all of the items above, but if you don't need the physical IPD adjustment, I find it hard to believe that the *Quest* is the right choice for someone who is focused on *PCVR*.",oculus

Yeah sorry about that. But thanks for the feedback you definently swayed me back into Rift S. One last question though I play on a 60hz monitor which I don't really mind. But I heard that only having what 90hz is a crazy difference in VR. Is that an over exaggeration or is it true?,oculus

"I'm sure I'll get downvoted... But I'm not liking it. (1)Performance is not good. I'm on a 1080 , with plenty O ram , i7-7700k ..And it looks like trash on med settings. Which is the only setting to get it to run smooth. What specs are devs testing these things on ?? (2) Inverse kinematics aren't great either - at this stage in VR development , I expect better. Lone echo seemed to get it right years ago.(3) enemies aren't exciting and mostly all look the same-ish. (4)Climbing rock surfaces with arms and magnetic plates just doesn't feel right either. slip stream is a novelty - but it wears off quick. Honestly, this game was my most anticipated. I feel really let down now. If a dev like insomniac can't nail it - maybe VR just can't be a viable medium for great gaming. The guns are weak feeling , like bb gun pew pew weak. They CONSTANTLY vibrate when your hands get near them - WORST FEATURE EVER. I'm really sad to say it was a refund request. I hoped Co-op was going to make it worth it - I jumped in a match and felt underwhelmed by that as well. Sorry to be negative- but I'm just being honest.",oculus

They should make a review lock where you can't review a game unless you've played it for 30 min. I think steam does something like that,oculus
"If it becomes a consistent and ignored issue, sure; if it's just a launch issue that needs rectifying by a party other than the game's developer, such as the platform owner Facebook, then no that's not worth throwing a negative review for issues the developer wouldn't have control over.",oculus

People want the world and then expect it to be perfect on day one? Yeah okay sounds like being a glutton for punishment to me.

The better alternative is to accept that your hobby requires incredibly complex technical feats to pull off and a couple of launch day glitches should be expected. These people really do do it to themselves.",oculus
Do you own a VR headset how does it feel in VR?,oculus
Is it? Games are complicated dude. And there no way to stress test server loads better than launch day. Take a little responsibility for the massive technical achievemtn you're so cavalierly expecting to go perfectly.,oculus
"Nope, cause I hadn't tried to play it yet.

"I have tried ""flinging"" but this is exactly the sort of motion that can fling my shoulder out of it's socket.

Can you do it from the wrist ?",oculus
Not even close to the same situation.,oculus
"I don't have the answer yet, but I know exactly how you feel. I'm looking at the map, and at the cliff, back at the map, back at the cliff, and I think ""They cannot be serious!"" But they were, the full size map attachment thingy was on the corpse up top.

Having said that, it's easier to climb in relatively slow, methodical swings. Reach up with the left, grab, swing yourself up with full range of motion and drift a bit. Simultaneously reach up with the other hand, grab, repeat. Basically you don't go left-right-left-right in short steps, where you don't release the left until the right has a good grip. Instead you go leeeeeeft, drift up a  little bit, then riiiiiiiight, again drift up a bit and leeeeeeft again. What initially took me maybe 20-25 short methodical motions I could later do in 7-8 wide swings.

But yeah, I can see how this can be a problem for someone with shoulder issues. No Man's Sky is certainly more civilized in this regard - just activate your jetpack and float up.",oculus
We have a very different set of opinions it seems.  I don't think i'll be able to convince you that being excited for your hobby is a good thing.  I don't think you'll be able convince me that expecting launches to fail is something we should accept.   Let's agree to disagree and call it a day.,oculus

Yeah it sucks but this is business. It's just as dumb for users to bend over backwards for some developer based on the way they want a game to be though. If this game is amazing then it'll be fine and the good reviews will come. 3 stars is average and not a bad review.,oculus
Oh alright that sounds great.,oculus
"Exactly. I kind of worked out the movement you're describing and it does feel like a movement that requires repetitive rotation of the shoulder ( my issue ).

I didn't dare practice doing it enough to get good at it, but I'll give it a more cautious and considered approach tomorrow. 

Even so, I was climbing up overhangs and stuff, there's that one tower with the gaps between the orange ""easy"" sections and I had to climb over a 5 meter horizontal overhang onto a platform.

I don't have those problems on the RIft S.  My only complaint on the RIft S tracking is how often you have to set it up (every major update) and that when it wants a set up, the damn thing wants to run all the health and safety / demo crap all over again.",oculus

"7700HQ with a mobile 1070, 16gb ddr4.  I can play on a mixture of low and medium settings at 80% resolution.  With these settings i get around 10% asw during intense scenes.  When forcing ASW on i can max the game out just fine though it does make your characters body pretty jittery.  The very first scene in the game where you have access to the graphics menu is a realistic representation of performance during intense scenes.

The game does have very flexible graphics settings, with low settings being very forgiving, and every setting you turn up to medium from low causing about a 5-10% drop to performance headroom. Most settings have very little performance impact beyond the transition from low to medium.  I would reccomend turning the specular probe option off if using ASW, it causes pretty intense artifacting in shiny areas.  I would note that my mobile cpu is the absolute minimum spec i would reccomend, the game often pushes it to 90% usage.",oculus

Reality will probably be somewhere in the middle, with many pros and cons. If you're interested in that, soon will be the time to buy a Quest.

And on the Rift S side, it looks to be getting a $50 discount for Black Friday. The Quest is not supposed to receive this discount. So *if* Link turns out to be garbage, and you're only interested in PC VR, soon will be the time to buy a Rift S.

"Perfect and best-ish are two very different word. Minesweeper is a perfect game, but it sure as heck is not the best game, not even close. 

Whether something is perfect or not is measurable. Whether something is the best or not is subjective and depends on what a person wants out of the game. 

Another example: Nier Automata is in my opinion a solid 5 out 5 with my only regret being I can't give it a 6 out of 5. It is definitely not perfect though. The control system isn't ideal, it has a strange learning curve, the PC port (still has) internal rendering problems which a modder fixed dramatically improving graphics, it's poorly optimised, but I'll be dammed if I don't consider it the best game I played in 2017.",oculus

So here's what happens in that circumstance. 

People get excited about a game with depth coming to vr at X date. People then make changes to their life such as taking holidays from work and robbing grannies to buy said game on time(as they're not cheap). 

Developers then drop the ball and the game you've bought isn't ready. The holiday you've taken is wasted and you've just robbed s granny. All of this because developers are too incompetent to screen their games for bugs properly before release.(this is a big problem in the gaming industry atm).

Any big thing is complicated, not just games. They have to take responsibility for what they have sold, not the other way around. Games didn't use to get special treatment in the past and there were plenty of technical achievements back then as well. The reason why stuff like this is the norm nowadays even with AAA titles is that they can get away with it. At the end of the day, we're still buying their buggy release and will be buying their next.

so, for your project, i thought of 2 possible options,    1  if you can get pc software for the drone,  and it has a side by side display option, you could boot up big screen on your pc, run the software  put big screen into side by side, and in theory you would get a  3d image of the drones output in front of you.

or, if your drone only has android software, you could download an android emulator for pc, and then use it in bigscreen side by side mode.

I know it's not exactly the same, but as others have said this is an event for some people, and it's really important for some people, other people don't care. Some people don't care about watching the Superbowl live (or at all)

I do also have sympathy for the Devs and technical team. Because I'm pretty sure they wanted and planned for a smooth launch, it suck for them aswell.

People have a right to be angry and disappointed. But be angry at the situation, not the people who put alot of effort into the game, or the people trying to fix it.",oculus

"We are voting with our wallets already, thanks.

"Yep, as soon as it became clear that oculus had no plans of providing more cables I sold my CV1 for 400€ and bought an index so I won't have to deal with it. Definitely not the best bang for the buck but the quality is superb and when oculus support is telling people to buy a rift S because their CV1 cable broke they've broken any trust I had with them.  

Wouldn't be surprised if they do the same as soon as they release a Rift 2 or a Quest 2.  

That said the Rift S is probably the best headset for it's price to performance as long as Microsoft keeps ignoring their WMR platform.",oculus
Didn't know there were leather pads for the halo yet! Could you tell me where you got them from? I can't find any on google.,oculus
"Yep. We are currently voting. We've been voting since the first title without subtitles/language. And talking about developers: almost all the VR games that Sony publishes have language or subtitles inside. And they have nearly 500 titles so far.

Releasing a product late doesn’t relate to the quality of the product, so downvoting a product for being released late isn’t helpful to anyone else

"You are absolutely right, I support this thread, Spanish is one of the most spoken languages ​​in the world and not even finding subtitles in games like Asgard Wrath is very frustrating. 

 If Oculus wants to become big in this video game industry, he must look at Sony with all its great games, which have full dubbing to all the most spoken languages ​​in their most relevant games.  

Friends of oculus, if you want to reign in this industry, you have to rethink the strategy at this point and at least offer us subtitles.",oculus
"The Quest is still far more uncomfortable than the Rift S for extended play sessions and due to the compression used in transferring the graphics from PC to quest, the graphics will not be as good as the Rift S.

The Rift S is still the superior headset for PCVR, so if you don't care about taking the headset anywhere, Rift S is still the more sensible choice.",oculus

I didn't want to judge the A.I. too harshly just yet as it's early parts of the game , but yes they are pretty dumb so far. The shooting is also at present, what i'd call Serviceable, Like it all works as i'd want but it lacks a little punch and pazaaz, and the bullets are a little slow to travel but it's mostly fine so far.

These past few months have been AAA VR overload ! Not complaining at all though. The more the merrier :),oculus
"Yes subtitles for you. Not every language. Also Asgard's Wrath is an indie title for all intents and purposes made by an almost non existent studio known for absolutely nothing. 

Even Sony isn't pleasing everyone, so it's a bit much to expect companies with a small fraction of the funds creating a game targeted at a small fraction of the players, with an expectation that they won't pay AAA process too do the same.

Storm land is at least developed by insomniac but you're still not taking about a remotely AAA process title on a popular platform.

Like it or not, this is a niche.",oculus

"This is like the 4th post with this. I can only assume the company hired damage control social media blitz team after a catastrophic launch....

"Why not?

Reviews are not designed for people to punish the developers.

Instead, they're designed to help players decide whether the game is any good or not. Feedback made in the first week probably isn't going to be very useful a month later - games tend to experience a lot of issues shortly after release that quickly get fixed.",oculus
"The Bionik Mantis earphones for PSVR clip on so they become part of the headset and cost about 60 bucks.  It's not a perfect fit but you can attach them reasonably easily.  The only downside is they are white, but quite a few people have painted them black with model paint.",oculus
I'm not sure why you're so uptight about people giving honest reviews then.,oculus
"Yes, but does it run Crysis?",oculus
"I'm not. They didn't give a review. They gave a temporary experience and provided nothing of value (in fact decreased the value) to people who depend on reviews. 

Personally I'm all for every review in first week from release being deleted for everything.
Solves review bombing. Solves angry rants. Since reviewers being bought to generate game day hype.

I'm uptight because the concept is irrevocably broken and release day impatient rangers are the problem.

I bet you both my testicles that if the release was load managed and staggered to solve the problem people would post bad reviews as well.",oculus
"&gt;Any game that is gifted or redeemed with a key won't be counted either.

"I'm just going to mention some games that either use the PC, phone, or no machine at all, whilst 1 other person is in VR as it's easier to group them. You didn't mention if this was an online thing you wanted, or local coop/vs, so I'll mention everything

- Keep Talking and Nobody explodes. VR person defuses a bomb, everyone else has a manual that tells you how to defuse the bomb, basically a communication puzzle game
- Black Hat Cooperative (Local, same PC) VR person is stealthing through an environment, PC player is ""the guy in the chair"" telling them about security systems, disabling things, etc.
- Acron (Online). Needs android/ios Device, minimum 2 non-VR players. VR player is a giant tree protecting it's acorns, other players are squirrels trying to steal them. Simple premise, pretty fun with a group.
- Late for Work (local, same PC). VR player is basically King Kong, rest of the players are in cars/planes etc. trying to stop you
- Rec Room (Online), Rec Room now supports non-VR players, so you can play that together
- VRChat (Online). Same as rec room

One note is that all the local only games, all have the new ""remote play together"" tag on Steam, so it's possible you can do those remotely/online too.",oculus
"&gt; I could spin up 1TB/s worth of bandwidth worth of servers in the next 30 minutes if I really wanted to

I've only got experience with Amazon, and while you can get a lot of flexibility there are certainly instance limits. IIRC Digital Ocean has a similar limit system.

As you run more servers you get a higher cap such that you can usually burst up quite a lot, but not to the amount you'd need for a game's launch.",oculus

"You're being selfish by demanding these people review according to your dependencies and preferences.  

A failed launch is a bad review worthy event.  It informs customers of a trend.   If server problems persist then those reviews are a record of them occurring since the beginning.  

A game that installs only a few kb of data and is not a product is less than one star worthy.  Insomniac is a highly successful AAA studio.  There's no excusing them for it and those reviews are rightly so.",oculus
"They're making posts like this because VR isn't that big still, it's a growing industry and shit like this doesn't help. We all want VR to get more support so it can further fly in the mainstream - but companies get put off by shit like this, which is absolutely not what we want for our beloved platform.",oculus
"Nope I'm demanding reviews reflect the product im looking up. That's not selfish, that is the singular fucking point.

You want to review the Oculus launcher, go ahead. You want to review Insomniac Studios  launch practices go ahead. But stop shitting on something not relevant.",oculus
"I think the point this person is trying to make is that, the fact that they couldn't play the game when they were told they could is a bad thing worthy of a bad review. A game might have great gameplay but if you've carved out time to play something and you just can't physically through no fault of your own, that's something to hold against the people responsible. Technical issues like that actually reflect on your perception of how good or not a title is.

That being said, I definitely don't think 1 star review bombing should be the way to reflect that. If people want to review the final product a little worse because of the rocky launch issues, sure, but they shouldn't be allowed to review the game before they've actually played it in my opinion.",oculus
"We live in an instant gratification, I want to speak to your manager, I want my mommy society.

"What worries my the most is the lack of transparency Oculus has at the matter.

For localizing a program, you must plan that in advance, specially in the videogame industry, where allways has been the publisher who does it, not the developper.

So before you start the game, the publisher must agree with the developper on formats, workflows, and everything that will be related to the localizatión. 

The localization is done at the end, but if you don't plan it before, when it's time to localize, the developper will not have exactly what the publisher need.

If you've played any major titles over the past years and see how poorly QA testing has become for even some of the industry's largest developers (as a long-time Battlefield fan I'm looking at you DICE), you'd put more leniency on VR teams (even very much experienced ones such as Insomniac).

No. Just no. You cannot feasibly force small studios to spend extra money translating their game to cater to every language. And if you force the platform they sell their games on to spend that money the price of games has to go up to accomodate the increased expense.,oculus

Can a title have issues at launch, yes; those can be corrected. Can reviews, as you say, be updated? Yes, of course. Are they updated? Most likely not. The vast majority of users post reviews and simply leave them even if a patch fixes their specific issue, it's very unlikely they'll update the reviews.",oculus

I'm sure some setups will have flawless CV1 tracking and I was perfectly happy with it, but despite spending a fortune on cards and USB cables, with my wide room, there was still occasionally ""hand off"" wobble sometime between cameras and there were more dead-spots (though very rare in a practical sense) than there are on Rift S.

I dont know what i turned on there that fixed it but just turn on everything it fixed it for me. Half of those things probably will not do anything but its better to be safe then sorry.,oculus

"Seeing as Sony bought Insomniac, I don't know if we can count of any kind of major updates beyond just getting the game running smoothly. 

Having said that, I look at Lone Echo, and Stormland, the campaign length is roughly the same. The price is the same. But at least Stormland has some replay value in co-op and the world rerolling. So, theoretically, anyone who bought Lone Echo and managed to enjoy changing lightbulbs and fuses for 5 hrs would probably enjoy Stormland.",oculus

If you ask me they should encourage this level of candidness from everyone,oculus
"Yea it's really not about just smart people, there will be plenty of them, but it is hard to find guys like John that make smart decisions and learn from mistakes like this guy. You do not need him to write final code, you need him to think and test where to go next.",oculus

"Yes, the point is that it seems like you should be able to type in the code, but it just pushes random buttons until you find both pictures.",oculus
I have both a quest and a rift s. For me there’s no debate that the S is better. Comfort and clarity are well above the Quest and the link isnt going to change that. If you think youll use the portability of the quest a lot then go for the quest. But if ocvr is your main concern then the S is a no brainer.,oculus

"While Insomniac is now under the Sony umbrella, that doesn't mean another studio can't take over on Stormland. If the game does well and Oculus/Facebook owns the IP (which I assume it does) I'm sure they'll get someone else to maintain and update the game, just as Microsoft has done with the Halo and Gears IPs (though hopefully Oculus well have better results).",oculus
"That's all theoretical though. As it stands we just don't know how to build an AGI, and the concept is still sci-fi. Maybe there's an easier way to do it, or maybe intelligence/cognisance/etc is just way too complex to be feasibility emulated by computers.",oculus

In addition, this is a guy who wants to be productively working for way longer than a typical workday. He probably feels like VR is in a state where he can't really productively work on things for a while until some other pieces of the business or tech catch up.

But then they ""new and improved"" it, and suddenly the targets were hard to see (when they went from 4 colors down to 2, it made it trickier to see which punches they wanted), and the punch detection was suddenly really inaccurate. 

Now I've only played it a couple of times in the last year due to all of their ""improvements"", but recent reviews show a lot of changes, so will be giving it a go again in the near future to see if playability has improved at all, since it WAS so great when I first got it.

Well the game that is... the original stream I did... not so much. As it always is when I try to live stream a game things got glitchy and I had some tech difficulties. This caused me to end the stream after only about 30 minutes into the game.

After the first stream I had many people reach out and ask if I was going to show more of the game and I am happy to say that yes I am. Since we are still one day away from launch and since I am sure there are still a lot of people wanting to see some gameplay pre-launch I have decided to try this again tonight. Come along with me on my journey through Stormland and lets chat about this game and all things VR related! \[\]-)

The positive is that the 3d effect is pretty good for a move.

The negative is the low resolution and how uncomfortable it is to wear a VR headset for that long. 

The environment is the standard oculus TV environment and I found that rather distracting, this resolved itself because I had to take the headset off shortly after starting the movie and when I put it back on the environment had become a black void with only the movie screen in front of me. I don't know if there is a way to activate this blank environment on purpose but it was far superior. 

If the resolution was higher and the selection better, I would rent/buy more movies to watch this way but as it stands, I doubt I will repeat the experience.",oculus

Definitely agree on the Quest. That was a no-brained early adopter choice for me. But mainstream popularity really hasn’t taken off for as long as it’s been out, and there really aren’t that many experiences with a broad appeal.

I think part of the problem is that VR today is an extremely anti social experience. I have loads of friends want to come over and try out VR, but it always turns out to be a bore for anyone without the headset on. And they are completely disconnected from those around them.

Even with flat video games, people can watch you play, but spectating VR in person is a really shitty experience even if what they see is projected on screen.

The closest decent spectating experience is those streams where folks have elaborate green room setups... but that doesn’t scale.",oculus

"5 seconds is incredibly fast for any game.. but I mean the level music that accompanies the black fade in lasts longer than 5 seconds.   There is 20-25 seconds of loading before that.

Today I finally got the chance to explore Insomniac's new VR game Stormland and so far I'd have to say that it is absolutely amazing! Well the game that is... the original stream I did... not so much. As it always is when I try to live stream a game things got glitchy and I had some tech difficulties. This caused me to end the stream after only about 30 minutes into the game.

After the first stream I had many people reach out and ask if I was going to show more of the game and I am happy to say that yes I am. Since we are still one day away from launch and since I am sure there are still a lot of people wanting to see some gameplay pre-launch I have decided to try this again tonight. Come along with me on my journey through Stormland and lets chat about this game and all things VR related! \[\]-)

Stormland releases on 11/14/19 so if you want to experience this game, and I highly suggest that you do, then make sure to grab a copy from the link below!\[}-)

"This hit me harder than I thought it would be...

This is the man **directly** involved in some of the best software advances for Quest.",oculus
Sounds like he already have at least theoretical idea how to improve AI and start tackling AGI. Quite exciting!,oculus
I wonder how it looks like. In the screenshots it looks great. Maybe they can give a few pointers to Asgard's Wrath on how not to use 100GB+ ;).,oculus
At least some minutes.,oculus
"It seems like Oculus' getting more empty each year. Wonder when Abrash decides to say ""Welcome back, Valve"".",oculus
"It isn't the engine, it is how they are using it. I am 90% sure Lone Echo uses UE4. But you are right, a lot of UE4 games have that ""look"" bc lots of devs don't have good technical artists (it's a super hard job).",oculus
"I almost feel like a bigger publisher/dev should go to someone that makes a game like B&amp;S and say ""your combat is great we want to build a large GAME around it"".

Every likes B&amp;S combat but just wait until the two Walking Dead games come out...VR combat is getting a big upgrade",oculus
but you can do exactly what you said...the only difference is that there will be new bases/islands to explore and take out like bandit camps in far cry.,oculus
"I come from Destiny, so I am actually pretty excited. Of course I would prefer a larger bespoke world and longer story, but the idea of a weekly reset is really cool to me.

A lot of us will finish the story in a couple of days and then what? Well the reset will give you new stuff to do (I think) and gives you a reason to come back if you like the core gameplay",oculus
SO many people have played it in 2D. It isn't a good port. The price is too much.,oculus
"They have to be working on it. The Quest is doing really well, and it’s the first consumer friendly, full featured VR headset. They shot for low cost this time around using a mobile chip from almost 3 years ago. 

I am pretty damn confident that they must be planning on doubling or tripling the fidelity of the graphics Quest just by throwing modern mobile components in there.

Carmack really got Oculus where he wanted them: releasing a mobile based headset that has mass appeal. He’s likely moving on because the problem he wanted to solve is mostly solved. And he doesn’t enjoy the process of working on a slowly maturing product. Which is probably why he sold iD to begin with.",oculus

"It wouldn't make sense to spend 50-100M on a VR game even if there were literally 3x as many HMDs out there. It's too risky to do that anyways, which is why every AAA game has MTX.",oculus
"Many great games on Steam, personally I love to the top and climby if your into climbing games. Full version of Rec Room (Grrr rec room no longer updating old content) I enjoy In Death alot I also seen few others talk about it too thought it was a low key game but seems others have interest in it too.",oculus
and walking dead too! supposed to come out this year,oculus
"Unfortunately this is what I feared. Nothing to drive a player to play for long periods of time. If you are going to make procedurally generated levels there needs to be a strong sense of progression either in narrative or power to the player. Otherwise whats the point? That said its actually still good value for a VR game considering price/length/polish and included co-op, I just know we were all expecting something incredible so its hard to not be a little let down.",oculus
"I see the next version of the Quest being a Quest S, with better resolution, slightly better graphics, and maybe a bit smaller and lighter. The real advance will be with foveated rendering and eye tracking, and I don't think that's ready enough for 2022-ish.",oculus
"Thank you for using text. I am old and would still rather read for one minute than watch someone else play it for twelve. I was going to buy it, but after reading your review I don't think it's for me. That may not have been your intent, but I appreciate your insights.",oculus

"I think it’s worth it. It’s quite unlike any other VR game I’ve played so far. The puzzles get really intense and the sense of relief from clearing them is just like pulling one of those last-man clutch plays in Pavlov or Onward. As for replay value, I definitely plan on getting a kick out of seeing how my wife or friends handle some of the tougher stages.",oculus
"No worries.  The point was to provide information to help folks with their own buying decisions, not to be a commercial or try to influence you one way or the other!",oculus
I'm in the process of doing exactly that right now. Bit of a pain.,oculus
The first screen is amazing. It litterally has basically everything anyone could ever ask for with the exception of teleport movement. This is what people need to see to learn what settings are neccessary in vr games,oculus

"I hope there will be some comparisons with Asgard's Wrath. Don't know which one to get first, AW or Stormland.",oculus
Or get stuck on memes.,oculus
"Serious maybe at AW they should have a look at Stormland. They have an install size of 20GB apparently. Here I need to uninstall the game and re-install it completely just to handle an update since I 'only' got a 500GB SSD with also some other stuff on it, so after AW I 'only' had 100GB free. 250GB required to normally use a game like AW is just too much. 

Also my first attempt at re-installing resulted in an error message. Hopefully my second attempt does work.",oculus

"Valve ? Why would he go to Valve ? To do the same thing on a smaller budget ?  
  
You know Valve is anecdotal to that man's career, if he goes back to one of his older companies, Intel is a much safer bet.",oculus
"I'm so excited after several reviews, I want this game even if would last only 2 hours ... if feels so VR !!!!!!",oculus
There's also an issue with credit card payments failing altogether when you try and pre-purchase Stormlands. Oculus Support are aware of it.,oculus
"No, this is the initial release that didn't have touch controllers which you definitely need, and the Vive or Index ones are NOT compatible. You also need at least two of the camera sensors.",oculus
"I suspect the ""consulting CTO"" position is specifically meant to soften that perception, much like when Carmack first joined Oculus as CTO but still remained with Id in some informal capacity.",oculus
"This seems like a decent price for two OG controllers (assuming they're in good condition), but you still need one more camera sensor on top of that.",oculus

What do you want ?

"But the game is owned by Oculus ? If yes, they can create DLCs with new missions ...",oculus
"You can possibly get everything to work with just 1 camera, but probably not very well.",oculus
No doubt John will work together with Elon on this venture.,oculus
"&gt;Asgard's wrath is all there is for story driven stuff with good combat.

I loved Asgard, but locomotion is very poor, and locomotion can be very fun on VR. I think I'll love Stormland even more ...",oculus
"I know this is an old comment, but you’ve perfectly voiced my feelings towards the recent big VR releases.",oculus
"&gt;I think part of the problem is that VR today is an extremely anti social experience. I have loads of friends want to come over and try out VR, but it always turns out to be a bore for anyone without the headset on. And they are completely disconnected from those around them.

Staring at a phone during a get-together is often ""the norm"" it's less isolating but at times it's hard to define a meaningfull difference.

But there are few games that engage more people. With asymmetric gameplay. 

Keep talking and nobody explodes is pretty great when you divide chapters across people and one defuses it.

Even I expect you to die with casting can work nicely with collective solving the puzzle.

And that's only mittigation of anti-sotial IRL multiple people. But online... It's more social than just voice chat in game. With way people move/gesture.

I think an issue is hassle/comfort/cost. And some of that won't get entirely solves so it has to be counterballanced with kick ass contente be it gaming apps or experiences.

&gt;The closest decent spectating experience is those streams where folks have elaborate green room setups... but that doesn’t scale.

I think the window into VR with an ipad was a pretty neat way to spectate. Giving the viewer more control over the spectating experience. And if you'd add some form or interaction like marking targets alerting to enemies outside of player view or playing a support role. That would be pretty great.

As for John Carmack... I hoped he'd stay for longer as the pace of VR development and how much improvement there is to gain is still pretty great. I wouldn't expect him to slog over minor advancements that we have in pretty mature segment of smartphones. But i hoped he'd pour more of his brain into VR. But from a personal standpoint i get it. I bet there was some corpo stuff that bogged him down but also working on same stuff can get exhausting. Hope he'll do great in AGI that won't try to rocket jump of humans ;]",oculus

Basically, if you don't have a native DP, you should consider yourself out of luck.

You reset each cycle and replay the game in variations that continue to get harder. I dont believe you unlock anything different that you get in the first 4-6 hour run through.

"I had the Quest since shortly after launch and got the Rift S a few days ago. With the Quest it's been smooth sailing, both in Quest-specific content (except Beat Saber which simply didn't work well for me) as well as streaming PCVR content via a 5GHz router. It's not perfect, but it's getting better all the time and once Oculus Link is here you always have the option to use that to get in the Rift ecosystem if the streaming is to wonky for you. That aside, many games on Quest can be played with people on Rift if you add them as friends.

The Rift S on the other hand worked for two days and then suddenly wouldn't accept any of my USB 3.0 (and 3.1) ports, even after getting a recommended pcie USB card. Instead of playing a lot of VR like I could when I got the Quest I've spent hours upon hours of my valuable time troubleshooting and not even getting close to fixing the problem. I've got kids and a full time job, the evenings are the only time when I can do hobby stuff. I'd say if you want a wide variety of options and mostly hassle-free VR (wireless on top of that) get the Quest. The Rift S seems to be prone to software and connectivity issues and frankly, if I don't get this fixed within the week it's going back, all this fiddling is just not worth my time. I shouldn't have to reinstall my entire operating system just because one device/software isn't optimised enough to just work on most machines.",oculus

Or Rocket League, people absolutely hate that game, what, am I a ball-bouncing clown kart now? It's way too difficult and wonky to be any fun!

Or Diablo! So boring to play through the main campaign and then do Baal Runs, that's why Blizzard shuts their servers down after four months.

Asgard's Wrath offers a minimum of 40 hours of gameplay in a vast world, even though it's not Open World. You have tons of sims (race, flight) with excellent VR support and unlimited lifespan too.

Absolutely not. VR/AR is still the future. All the big companies are still racing towards the first mass market product. This has nothing to do with the health of the industry and everything to do with Carmack’s own personal desires and what he wants to spend his time on in this last stage of his life. He wants to see the fullest extent of what he is capable of while his brain is still functioning well.,oculus

VR/AR is one of the last frontiers. Facebook is not going to give up on it. Ever. If they DJ t get there first, someone else will. And as a company whose primary platform is slowly losing relevance, that’s not something that Facebook wants to see happen.

With his background in computer graphics, VR and rocket science, I'm sure he's in a good place to make a valuable contribution. Also being associated to Facebook helps a lot. 

The main problem here is it's easy to make a contribution to specific AI that works in a narrow task (essentially the whole field of machine learning now) but tacking general AI is a massive goal that we have no idea how to even start. Most of the superstar researchers in ML regard that as an unproductive goal, and they'd rather work on incremental progress that hopefully will get us there eventually.",oculus

"None of these games would be made of Oculus wasn't subsidizing the developers to fund them - If Oculus wanted to put up enough money I'm sure Epic would have been on board for the port, but like you said they have fortnite and other titles to worry about so even with that guaranteed subsidized profit it's not worth it to them.

Have a set time in VR like 15 to 30mins at first. Stay hydrated. Eat something before VR play. Try doing breathing exercises before VR. Try not fitting the headset on too tight, keep it loose. Try sitting down during VR sessions.

1. check if your USB cable is connected to headset, sometimes it is not entirely connected. Thats why nothing lights up. Plug in only USB cable and check you Device Manager, you sould see if anything is connected, if you see Rift S recognised, if you dont see any new device appearing, then it must be that you headset is not connected. Disassemble you headset to disconnect and reconnect cable.
2. Be sure, that USB port you are connecting to is actually USB3, try other ports, disconnect any other USB devices.
3. Plug in only USB cable and check device manager, if there is Rift S device, then issue will be your USB port, if you tried all ports and you are sure that your port is USB3, then it might by unsupported or too old, try on another PC or just by PCI Express card with USB 3",oculus

"I think this is nested in some deeper psychological issues. I can relate to many of the ones you've mentioned here, one of them being submechanophobia. You probably get the same fear in main menus because you're ""floating"", and your body is gone. It creates a fear in your subconscious mind because you are not you anymore. You're the object of something else all of a sudden, and you've lost control of yourself.. It's important to address the issue from a psychological standpoint rather than the VR itself. Understanding WHY you feel the way you do is the first and also the most crucial aspect of getting better.

"This ignores the fact that countries have been running on nuclear for decades at competitive prices. The consumer price of electricity in France is lower than Lazard's purported cost.

Remember that Lazard bases its estimate entirely on the AP1000 build in Vogtle, which is the first reactor the US builds in 30 years. It also only assumes a 40 year lifetime (it will likely double that), uses a high discount rate and doesn't take into account the system costs of solar and wind, only the cost of a single generator. It doesn't take into account the diminishing value of intermittent electricity when wind/solar is abundant. In short, LCOE is a flawed metric to use.

That is not to say that new nuclear is not expensive, it's a huge upfront cost, especially when using private capital and there is definitely a lot of room for improvement. But even the stupidly expensive Hinkley Point C has a construction cost of around 1 cent per KWh when taken from over its 60 year lifetime. Paid off nuclear plants in the US generate electricity at prices of $30/MWh. As a short term investment they're far too expensive and have too much regulatory uncertainty and risk, but they have phenomenal value as long term investment for a country.

It has an amazing world with mechanics that add a huge sense of scale and wonder. The combat is good for the most part, but I found the followers actually made it harder, and they are pretty much useless when against a shielded enemy.

The story is good and interesting for each hero character you play, and I thought the overall story was fine, but it was pretty predictable from the get go, considering the God you are working with.

Another idea: Followers should generate their own frenzy over time much like the rage meter, so you don't have to rely on frenzy mead every time.

Also, bug report: On the Seakings sidequest at the bar, you can reach in and grab the hero weapons under the glass.

So IFyou have the rift already, sure , get an adapter and cross your fingers.  But ify ou do not already have a rift, i wouldn't buy one if thats the system you intend to use with it.

"Depending on how portable you want to be. If you want a high end laptop, something like the [alienware area 51m](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/alienware-17-area51m-laptop). It's designed to be a proper desktop replacement, and is upgradeable (GPU will be modules from alienware directly, all the other components including the CPU, RAM and storage can be upgraded with off the shelf PC parts). It is bulky and huge though (4kg), but the all-in-one nature of it including screen gives you actual portability with pretty incredible power (i9-9900K), and the space to pack in proper cooling too, so you'll actually be able to get the most out of the hardware (super needed, as it uses 2 power adapters with a combined draw of over 500W). It also includes an alienware Graphics Amplifier port, which you could use to house an additional GPU when you're back at base to help run all those extra monitors and heavy rendering (Is the software mostly CPU based or can it be GPU accelerated) or you could use a thunderbolt GPU enclosure, but I'd advise their first party solution.  


If you want a compact high power prebuilt, I know Oculus Studios, Epic and a bunch of others use Falcon NW Tiki systems. Very expensive but very well built machines. Falcon also have a similar laptop to the Area 51m ([Falcon DRX](https://www.falcon-nw.com/laptops/drx/design)).

"The visuals and reduction in screendoor effect are way ahead of the cv1, this alone makes it a worthy upgrade. 

While they could create a pro variant with a higher refresh rate and better audio (or you just use headphones which is easier to replace when it breaks) this would also increase the cost which is probably not something they aim for.

The sensor tracking of the cv1 was a complete mess and while it worked it was horrible to setup. They really did some black magic with the insight out tracking of the rift s and while its hard to belief without trying you won't really notice a difference betweeen the two tracking methods and if you used 2 sensors instead of 3 i would go as far as calling it a straight up upgrade.

As for the link cable making the rift s obsolete thats not really the case  since the link cable just streams the data to your quest similar to what the wifi solution can already do kjust better. Due to this you will suffer from decompression and compression artifacts, the display wont use its full ressolution and there a probably some more tricks at work that make it achievable but i don't want to say anything wrong so  i will leave it at those two. So the rift s is still going to be your go to oculus device if your focus is pcvr.

Tldr.:The s is already an upgrade over the cv1 and the quest is a worse pcvr headset  than the rift s",oculus

"The explosion of the gaming industry was largely built on the console war between the SNES and Genesis.  As much as you may have missed out on a lot of games by only having one or the other, a LOT more games got made and released because of the heated competition.  And the more games that came out, the more appealing either system became and sales for gaming consoles started exploding.  This led to Sony wanting a piece of the action and drove things even further.  

Exclusives were a big driving factor in this competition.  And remain so today, but we're in an even better situation with VR in that while Apple and Oculus may have different exclusives driving adoption, it can convince a lot of 3rd party devs to get onboard with the medium and make content that can be released on both(and more) platforms.

"My wife and I have both put a bunch of hours into this, while also putting hundreds and hundreds of hours into other VR Rhythm games.  IMO the key points about Dance Central are:


1) It comes with the best *included* song selection by *far* of all the VR Rhythm games (that don't require 3rd party accessories).  There are 40+ tracks included with the base price and all are popular music.  Everyone's taste varies of course, but the tracks here are 100% guaranteed to appeal to the most people, as they are actual hit music.  


2) It is the only VR game that mimics to a decent degree real dancing.  Sure, there are really well-mapped fan-made Beatsaber tracks where you *feel* like you are dancing to the music, and some of the other VR rhythm games also push the ""feels like dancing"" point, but nothing else is even *remotely* close.  If you like dancing IRL and want to simulate it in VR, this is the *only* decent option.


3) It is extremely difficult to improve at.  Unlike other VR rhythm games, most people are either going to be good or bad at this one right away, and the improvement curve is small to non-existent.  After playing 30+ hours of Dance Central including spending a few hours in the tutorial mode, I'm not significantly better than the very first song I played (I'm a terrible dancer IRL as well).  Whereas my wife is a good dancer IRL, and was immediately good at Dance Central the very first song.  Contrasted to something like Beatsaber, ""Hard"" songs were initially challenging for us, but now we can pass most Expert+ and sleep through all the Experts.  


I've posted this elsewhere, but my take on VR Rhythm gaming is: Dance Central if you want to actually dance, Audica if you want a hardcore timing-based classic rhythm game challenge, and Beatsaber for everyone else.",oculus

"Am I the only one that tried and instantly uninstalled this mod? The weird FOV during cutscenes, the jittery movement due to the fact that it's not actually a VR game, everything just put it off for me.",oculus
"I don't want to offend anyone, but the VR quality offered by this mod is extremely low. I consider it is not acceptable, period.

As said in the mod, the author 'just' achieved stereotaxy in rendering a single '1000*1000' image at '90' Hz for the computational cost of a Full HD image at 45 Hz. At each frame, the camera is shifted from the left eye to the right eye position; you can clearly see this if you launch the game in non-VR mode with the mod still installed.

So, not only you don't have 90 Hz stereotaxic rendering, but even at 45 Hz it's unaccurate because the left &amp; right frames do not show the scene from the same viewpoint. It is excessively obvious if you drive a car in exterior view mode: not only are the surroundings blurry, they also are impossible to visualize.

The author of the mod clearly explains what he did and why, and I have nothing about it, but please stop bragging about playing GTA in VR. No, the quality is not acceptable; it draws us 2 decades earlier in terms of immersion quality. It makes us VR adopters appear stupid and contented by any poor s**t for the rest of the audience.

"I absolutely love this game way more than I expect and I think your assessment is incredibly accurate. If you are into dancing, this song list feels great since its got a bit of variation, but it fits for actual routines and things. The one thing that actually surprised me about Dance Central VR was the quality of the writing. Getting messages on your cell phone from the different characters and meeting up with them or unlocking their favorite routines for songs and trying to improve your scores on those is so rewarding. The thing is, not everyone is going to be looking to actually dance, so even though its an excellent rhythm game, I think that is a major hurdle when things like Audica, Beat Saber, Pistol Whip, and others exist where you are more focused on hitting the notes and dodging things instead of actually being aware of your body, head, and hand positions when actually dancing. Still, it's an awesome game that I find myself going back to all the time",oculus

"Can you provide any source on default overclock of Quest? It would be awesome but I don't believe it since for 99% there is agreement between Qualcomm and smartphone/Quest manufacturers, that they can't ship overclocked chips. It's possible that Quest don't throttle due to custom throttling governor and active cooling, but that's not overclock. As for ""Xbox 360 processing power"", that's common argument, but Carmack debunked it either on Oc6 or oc5. In terms of FLOPS metric - yea, it's x360 level. But GPUs that are used in mobile have different architecture, vastly more bandwidth oriented than latency-focused. So, in effect you can't render x360-like graphics on Quest, but you could mine similar amounts of some crypto like Monero on both. According to Carmack, Quest is about 50x less powerful than modern VR ready PC. As to argument that smartphones are limited by interaction methods - I agree.",oculus

"I said this before and I'll say it again - right now it's much better to have a PC+VR hybrid than a pure VR game in terms of pushing user adoption.

No Man's Sky is an excellent example - PC and VR players get to play together, and PC players get to see just how amazing VR is, by watching the VR player side-by-side with them. We can wave, fist-bump, punch with one hand and shoot with another, we can shoot a sentinel and loot at the same time, we can easily look around and find things much faster, etc. That really helps drive players' curiosity to try VR. As opposed to just making a game a VR exclusive, at which point everyone not in VR will just write it off as a lost cause.

I know this from personal experience - when I see a console exclusive, the game is dead to me, I don't bother to research it, or look at any coverage about it, it's a console game, and I'm a PC gamer.

Bottom like, this doesn't need to be either-or thing, or an us-vs-them situation. Ideally, games need to be pancake + VR hybrids, both for the game's population to remain vibrant, and to passively push VR. The mentality would be hey, I'm playing this game, I love this game, but it sure looks like that guy over there is having even more fun with this game, which I already love. And yeah, the headset costs as much as a new video card, but my video card is decent, and Black Friday is coming up, maybe I'll try it! And bam, you got another VR adopter. Whereas VR exclusivity just means ""Oh, it's a VR game? Moving on...""

The only exception would be a super-mega-massive platform seller game. Like if Valve released Half Life 3 as VR exclusive, and the game was actually great, yes people would bitch and moan, but I'm bet you dollars to doughnuts the VR headset sales would get a massive jump. And they could always release a pancake a year later, Rockstar-style.

And that's the second thing VR really, really needs right now - a social phenomenon, similar to WoW. Before it came along, biggest MMO has 275-375k subscribers (UO in '03), after WoW came out and crossed into the millions, when Blizzard optimistically expected to top out at 500k subs, MMO landscape changed. And we got a ton of MMOs out of it, and WoW is still alive after 15 years, still selling full price expansions every couple of years and raking in subscriptions. We need a VR WoW equivalent, something that is more than just a game, but a social phenomenon that everybody and their grandma played at one point or another. Something like it, but in VR, would go a long way towards pulling people in. 

Having said all this, I LOATHE exclusivity bullshit! It's bad enough when a company that developed the product keeps it in their own store, like EA with Anthem on Origin, or Ubisoft with Assassin's Creed on UPlay. It sucks, but they made it, so I guess they can do whatever. But when a company starts throwing fuck-you money around and buying up exclusivity from completely unrelated developers, Epic Store style, that just reeks.",oculus
It will take them that long to get out of beta. Then they will operate for 6 months. Then shut down.,oculus
"1
Never found tracking behind my back to be a problem. You never really do complex tasks behind your back in any game I have played. You can hit things and grab swords, shields etc. behind you back no problem.",oculus
What is that? My pc does have 3.0 usb ports if that matters. I have tried all ports on my pc (which so work with other devices just fine),oculus
"I played through the game last night, surreal experience to say the least. Synthesis Universe Episode 00 is like being deep inside 90s 'demoscene' screensaver, but instead of a flat splash of color in front of you it's all around you, and reacts to your movement. 

The game doesn't use any controllers, all interaction is based on gaze and head movement. I spent the first few minutes wondering what was going on until I realized that the batteries were charged, just that the game didn't want them :D

Episode 00 isn't long (20 minutes?) but is a perfect come down following a hectic round of Pistol Whip or Beat Saber",oculus
"Thrill of the Fight

Pistol Whip

Creed

BeatSaber

SuperHot

Blade and Sorcery (depending how you play)",oculus
"It's 5 cameras, a high res screen and sound running on USB 3.0.

Some chipsets don't deliver enough power and or bandwith on USB 3. I've seen a lot of people see improvements with a powered PCI-E USB card.",oculus
"I still don't know how Rift S is affected by the Link, or why that would put it in a weird place or obsolete it.

Rift S is wired. As soon as you wire up a Quest, it becomes a Rift S. As soon as you unplug the Quest, you can't play too many games (such as Asgard or Stormland) or in much, much worse quality, not to mention the games are all freakishly expensive (correct me if I'm wrong, but Quest hasn't had any sales on games yet). So how is any of it obsoleting a Rift S? And that's ignoring the fact that Quest with Link is still worse than Rift S (foveated, compressed image, lower refresh, albeit with crispier blacks, and comfort level is way lower). The only thing where Quest is objectively superior is the IPD adjustment, which isn't a factor for vast majority of players (since IPD is a bell curve that peaks on Rift S's default setting).

All Quest Link does is increase the flexibility of Quest, but it doesn't affect the Rift S.

The fate of Rift S is that it's a decent headset, and very good for the money you spend on it. It's very easy to set up and super accessible. Quality is nice. We'll be using it for years. And with any luck, a year or two down the line we might get a WiFi dongle for it, which will turn it into a Quest. And then we'll be talking about the fate of Quest.",oculus
to which I also agree,oculus
I've heard nothing but good things. Haven't used it myself.,oculus
Those games are a few needles in a haystack amongst piles of crap. You listed gems among countless of bad titles that Oculus are letting through without any filter at all.,oculus
"You can use controllers. But a word of warning, I couldn't get into this game AT ALL, it has some weird design choices. Like, some rooms require you to find a key, which gets boring fast, before you can advance. The dungeon layout is random, and there's no map, and everything looks the same, so it's very easy to get lost. The audio is weird, I often can't tell where the enemy is. The combat mechanics are also weird - you have to bring the right weapon for the right enemy, and if you don't, you'll have a bad time. But you don't know what the enemies will be until you enter, by which point it's too late. Weapons are also poorly balanced, and combat isn't particularly deep or interesting. 

Mind you, this might just be me. But I bought it, and over several months barely got 3 hrs of play into it, and even that was a struggle. But when it comes to controls options, there's many. You literally walk into an options room, with buttons on the walls, and you can adjust a ton of things about controls and movement within the game.",oculus
"You are misunderstanding how the tracking works.

Yes, the cameras can see infrared, and this is used to track the controllers.

But the headset itself doesnt produce its own light, so its dependant on the lighting in your room in order to track its position. The tracking will not work if your room is too dark.

If you arent playing in a pitch black room, its possible that you are either getting too much light (large windows) or the tracking is thrown off by things like mirrors.",oculus
I'm pretty sure it's compatible for steamvr games  when using something like openvrspace calibrator,oculus
lol,oculus
Having the same problem with you except that mine can work after a PC restart. Upload my diagnostic logs to Oculus and there's nothing they can help.,oculus
"Hmm, that's possible in my case, I play in my own living room and have two huge glass doors which produce light the whole time. So that might actually be it. Now that I think about it I usually close the curtains and turn on my large lamp and then there's no problems. I'll test this out.

Could it also have something to do with the fact that it's always on? Since it's constantly connected to my pc",oculus
"Can we take bets on which item gets smashed first?

&amp;#x200B;

The decanter looks sturdy, so I'll go for the Heart Mug",oculus
"Share your wisdom then? I'm opinionated, but I speak of things I understand, at least.",oculus
I didn't notice that but I'll check.  So this behaviour is intentional?  I don't see why this would be desired.  Do others have this?,oculus
"Better, but there's a bit more nuance to it. An ""All-In-One"" category would also include the fully 3dof Oculus Go &amp; hybrid dof Lenovo Mirage Solo. Being an owner of both a Go &amp; Quest unit, the experiences are bigger than Quest vs. PCVR.

Quest really is a trailblazer in that sense; a VR platform that defies any previous segment. I've more or less stuck to considering it a ""Rift console"".",oculus
uh why does this read like a spam?,oculus

**Name:** Synthesis Universe -Episode 00-

**Price:** $9.99

**Supported Platforms:** Windows

#About This Game

Welcome to Synthesis Universe - Story -  
  
Story is the first release within Synthesis Universe.  
It is an introduction, succession of musical sequences all linked through a
central hub.  
It is not a game, even if the world is aware of your actions.  
Expect a unique level of immersion, no menu or text, pure true VR
interactions.  
Each sequence is a story moment, inspired by the structure of the music. Every
note, every beat is alive and surround you.  
Welcome to Synthesis Universe.  
  
  
Episode 00 is about you, who are you in that story.  
It contains 4 main sequences, built around a Hub and a Timeline room (That
opens after the first run).  
It's a hybrid between traditional movie story telling, music video and game,
all happening in real time using Unreal Engine 4.  
  
**Important notes:**  
No guns, no violence: enjoy it the way you want: for the music, for the
visual, for it's unique immersion or for the story, looking everywhere for all
the details that make this world alive. Not everything will be obvious and in
your face, everything has a reason to be here.  
  
This is not a puzzle game, nor an exploration game, no locomotion.  
It's all about the story and how it is told through musical sequences and
unique visual.  
  
  
**CAUTION:** Built entirely for VR:  
As a true 360 musical experience, Standing strongly recommended, 360 necessary
sometimes.  
(Playing seated is possible but not optimal)  
  
Can be played just standing up, with very limited play space!  
Minimum room scale play space: 1.5m2 or 10feet2 is ok. (User standing up with
regular arm use)  
_Try to go off bounds!_  
  
Mostly gaze activated, the motion controllers are not much used in Episode 00  
  
Play time is about 30 minutes, but time is not limited.  
No save game, each time you start is like the first start, so it's possible
for you to share this experience among your friends and family.  
  
Watch the trailer for a dive into the Universe and music style.  
Enjoy!  
  
**Key and button in game:**  
**M**: Toggle screen mirror mode ON/OFF  
**Analog stick click**: Recenter/reorient view.  
**Esc**: Quit",oculus
"I dont think that having it constantly connected is an issue, it goes into standby once you take it off your head anyways. 

But closing all of the curtains and playing with artificial light is definitely worth a try.",oculus
Because it is,oculus
Actually it's depressing to have a little peek of GTA in VR and not to manage to play it decently. Driving a car from inside and outside views is a delight until I get fully blind...,oculus
Wish I could play this game but it crashed to lobby every 5 minutes,oculus
"Vorpx works pretty well with it, I only played a few minutes because I was getting sick feeling though",oculus
"Looking at the source article - from July - this is just based on a rumour and has not had anything confirmed by Facebook in all that time. It's unlikely the claim is true, as they would have announced it in September at OC6.

Sloppy journalism on Engadget's behalf, not to research the story properly.",oculus
"My only experience with behind the back tracking is with No Man's Sky to equip and put away the mining blaster, and to point backwards for the booster jump backwards.  The Rift S works well in both regards from what I've experienced.",oculus
"Thanks for the answer, I suspected it could be related to ue, but I wasn't sure about it... Now I'm at least 90% sure",oculus
"Thank you very much for recommendations, I will try to see them both soon.",oculus
I guess technically Sixense did half a decade ago.  :(,oculus
"I was surprised that valve didnt have a stable of vr games, including portal vr, ready when the index launched.",oculus
"Thanks, I didn't want to have to type all that out. If only technology ran on the optimistic dreams of the consumers...",oculus
"Thnx for rhe information, thats is a big deal for me in vr dev!",oculus
"It would depend on what you define as future proof.  I mean, it works, it has software support, and it has tech support.  It will continue to be supported for quite some time.

Do you mean in terms of screen resolution, refresh rate etc.  There are better headsets out already, and they continue to come out.  But as for whether that renders the Rift S obsolete, that's completely subjective.",oculus
"1 - Not a problem. After a few updates. S tracks things behind your back quite well. In 99,999% of situations, you won't be doing that anyway.

3- Taht's what I do.

4- Only if you can live with the worse tracking and image quality for pcvr. I don't think it's worth it just to get rid of one cable.",oculus
"The fact that they licensed Portal 2 and made a full VR version, then never released it, annoys me more than them never releasing the STEM controllers :(",oculus
"The Rift S is the best PCVR headset Oculus makes, until their next one.",oculus
"-	Bought Twinmotion and made it free
-	Reduced their cut from assets sold on the Unreal store from 30% to 12%, and provided refunds retroactively to all purchases since the store opening in 2014
-	Launched their mega grants program, which the Blender foundation was one of the first beneficiaries, receiving $1.2 million.",oculus
"We know, it was posted when it was news.",oculus
Pistol whip if you don't want to walk properly for days at a time from soreness lol,oculus
"That is debateable, I prefer my Quest.",oculus
Bets are open then!,oculus
"Nope.

It's first generation technology that's going to be outdated in no time. None of the currently shipping headsets have anything close to good enough resolution or field of view to be ""future proof"". 

For all we know Microsoft could release a new set of headsets tomorrow at half the price and double the specs. Can't really future proof an evolving technology.

With that said there's plenty of fun to be had with the Rift S as it is today even if it's ""outdated"" tomorrow. If you have enough disposable income and are interested in VR it's as good a place to start as any. They'll be $50 cheaper on Black Friday through Lenovo's site. Likely even cheaper if you look into cashback sites. I paid $320 for mine at launch and haven't regretted it much.",oculus
"Ep00 is closer to 30mn, if you know exactly what to do and don't breathe it's about 20 indeed, but from testing, people stays for about 35mn in there.  
   
They do believe it was 15mn though, because they feel it was, it's a great compliment for sure. Like good movies, they feel shorter than they are.  
   
About the controllers: Episode 00 have them enabled when you replay tracks (from the Timeline room), as the other room from the main hub are closed (they will be open for Ep01) you don't need ""hands"" for now.",oculus
"It's been confirmed that Splinter Cell and Assassin's Creed are indeed heading VR's way. 

Also Jason Rubin himself stated : ""I know [people ask] where’s Assassin’s Creed, where’s Call of Duty, where’s Madden? I get that but I think we’re at the point where we can start talking about those things and they will happen""

"Nvidia control panel will tell them all they need to know. The thunderbolt 3 / usb c port can be connected to the Intel chipset, but as long as the displayport icon is under the Nvidia GPU then this means the all important display port signal is coming from the Nvidia GPU and it will route through the Intel chipset to the port.  I know this because that's how mine is configured and the Rift S is working flawlessly.",oculus

"My answer would be a yes. I can see myself playing my Rift S in the next 2-3 years and maybe more. As long as the competition isn't offering very interesting stuff to the table, I'll be staying with my Rift S.",oculus
I got sick from the pancake graphics back then. It was so fast and intense with a very good atmosphere. Would love this in VR,oculus
This is marking research surveys that doesn't mean it's in development. They are just trying to see where to focus their efforts based on feedback.,oculus
"Pretty sure none of those are on it. I've gone the rip route, but did look at Fandango when it launched on Quest. There's only a couple studios on there. Disney definitely isn't one. Avatar/Alita Battle Angel aren't on it. I'm pretty sure Sony isn't a studio either.

There were like 50 or 60 movies on it, just a ton a B-tier stuff.",oculus

"Oh my god i still, to this day, remember fondly of that game. It had an incredible atmosphere, it was a freaking blast. Nostalgia kicks BEGIN :)",oculus
"It’ll run whatever new PCVR games come out for years to come, I’d say that’s what future roof means in this context. 

When games start absolutely NEEDING (as opposed to just benefitting) features the Rift S doesn’t have but newer ones do, then it’ll be obsolete, but that’s a long way away.",oculus

"Been looking forward to Stormland since it's announcement. It's one of the reasons I bought a Rift CV1 back then.

And they're right.,oculus
No one can smear VR as harshly as VR companies who continually prove that no one has a single idea what to do in a VR game.,oculus
"Nope, it's not just hardware. It's the fact that no one has any good ideas for what to do with the hardware that's currently available. It's a dud.",oculus
"1. It's not that bad. It'll loose track of your controllers if you put it on your back for too long. But I don't see any games (so far) that requires me to put my controllers on my back though.

2. Hand gestures will activate by touching the trigger or the top surface of the controller. Some of gestures will activate by pressing the trigger buttons. Also, some avatars will not have gestures or it has different gestures, it depends how the content creator wants it.

3. As long as it's AA sized batteries @ 1.2-1.5V then yes.

4. Since your interested in VRChat, I recommend you to talk to people in the game who are using Oculus Quest ask them for their experience with it. I heard there are optimization settings where you cannot see avatars that are not Quest Optimized but you can override it on the safety settings.",oculus
A bit unpolished this game but yes it's very tense and great to play.,oculus
"PSMS was how I started with VR and only get more excited about it. It has drawbacks like much sensitivity to lighting conditions and sensor calibration. This one seems really easy, the lighting conditions might change. It will not have very precise rotation.  
I hope will not disappoint you :)",oculus
"Except a door doesn't need a lock, no. Even then the door wouldn't become a key and a Quest certainly not a Phone.",oculus
"Yeah don't get me wrong. I love my VR headset and use it every day :) But I am having a really hard time finding good gems in the Oculus store, gems like the one posted here. Sometimes I feel that the Oculus layout makes me miss certain titles aswell.. If their banner has spesific style, colors or fonts, they are easier to ""ignore"". I wish it had more of a list view, would probably be easier for me to navigate.",oculus
Google glasses had potential.,oculus
"I know some Indie devs using UE.

UE does have an easy route to development that I think can be simpler than Unity, and that's by using Blueprints.

Blueprints provide a visual design to building your game that doesn't need any coding.

You can get some elements of visual design in Unity via assets (e.g. Playmaker) but Blueprints is officially supported in UE, and so has many more examples and tutorials to work from.

I'm actually a Unity dev myself, so I'm not promoting UE! Just wanted to point out that beginners should also consider UE because of Blueprints, and the choice of which engine to go for should be based on what your target game is intended to be and what assets you already have at your disposal.",oculus
I wonder how early I can install it.,oculus
"I am not even sure how to call it.   
I mean it's not a game as there is no score or achievement, or challenges to overcome, you can't fail/lose.  
It's just something to enjoy through.",oculus
"It is possible to back up the APK for a Quest app if that is what you are asking. That would allow you to reinstall them later.

No supported way to download store apps except 9n the Quest, but once you have them installed, you can make a backup.",oculus

The technology that people imagine for useful VR is so far removed from what's available today (smart phone screens duct taped to a helmet) that it might as well not even be called VR.,oculus
"Yeah except it was 10 years to early and instead of pushing the industry forward they do one half-assed attempt and jump ship.

I guess Google does that a lot. If it's not a hit its just a decent product that does things worse then it's competitors.

"&gt; It's more powerful than an Xbox 360

This isn't really a meaningful statement given the relative age of the platforms, and the architectural differences between them.  
  
&gt;The reason you don't see great AAA games on phones is because interacting with them sucks,  
  
This isn't true, the reason you don't see rich AAA experiences is mostly the same reason we don't have them in VR yet: The audience for them does not live on that platform in large enough numbers to support them.  The NintendoDS had far less relative hardware grunt, was a NIGHTMARE in terms of interface elements, and still saw plenty of AAA production. 
    
&gt;The Quest doesn't have that problem, because it's interface capabilities are essentially identical to the desktop rift.    
  
The super nintendo is capable of a great interface.  This isn't about hardware. We need to be honest about why we aren't getting big AAA stuff-  There just aren't enough of us yet.",oculus

"Well I have not bought this experience yet. So I am judging it by the info found here.
Vader Immortal left a bad taste in my mouth and because of this I have not bought the Episode 2.",oculus

"The thing is most pcvr games are designed with controllers in mind. So it makes sense to offer a headset with controllers. Since basically everyone wants a headset with controllers it doesnt make much sense to sell your device without controllers and doing so would probably not allow them to drop the price too much anyways.

So your only real option is to hope to find a second hand headset with broken controllers so you get a steep discount. 

Other than that i would generally don't advice a windows mixed reality headset because i find the controllers horrible and their controlller tracking worse than the competition (although certainly usable). But since you don't care for that that shouldnt bother you. So a cheap wmr headset might be your best bet although there is certainly a big difference in visuals between the cheapest wmr headsets like the lenovo explorer and the more expensive ones like the odyssey plus or hp reverb. But well the more expensive wmr headsets are more expensive so so at that point i would get a rift s for the better tracking.

VR isn't taking off or getting the attention you thought it would. I mean there's almost no advertisments of VR games if I didn't have an oculus I'd have no idea stormland was coming out tomorrow it's like the industry doent even consider it a valid platform. This is the biggest VR game of the year and almost zero mainstream coverage aside from the reviews coming out now.,oculus

"
Here is my opinion as posted elsewhere. Apologies to those who have seen it multiple times, but this topic gets posted several times a day. *We really need a sticky thread for it.*

*Oculus Link* turns the *Quest* into a *streaming PCVR* device, not a *native PCVR* device.

That means that the *Quest* is not *quite* as good for *PCVR* as the *Rift S* for multiple reasons:

* lower framerate - 72Hz
* smaller render target *(lower resolution video, said to even be lower than on CV1 but I cannot find an official source for this.)*
* mandatory *fixed foveated rendering* *(Really [ADDT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gocUADwqo8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=671), but I consider it a form of FFR because it prioritizes the center of the image, a pseudo fovea, over the edges of the image.)*
* capped 150Mbs video stream *(this may change but it will never match DisplayPort)*
* latency issues causing video artifacts, [*Sean Liu* from Oculus](https://youtu.be/K2zLneGGbk8?t=968)
* heavier
* one less tracking camera
* straps instead of halo *(subjective but makes a difference for long play sessions)*
* pentile  OLED *(subjective, but a lot of people think the Rifts S LCD is better for games)*

None of those are huge, but they add up especially, if you are looking for a PCVR focused device.

Don't take my word on it [here is what Carmack has to say about it](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1178332857909043201?s=20), and  [his comments about Beat Saber over Oculus Link](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1178721529741352960?s=20).

**Note:** If you have an IPD that is not supported by the *Rift S*, the physical IPD adjustment of the *Quest* can easily outweigh all of the items above, but if you don't need the physical IPD adjustment, I find it hard to believe that the *Quest* is the right choice for someone who is focused on *PCVR*.",oculus

"Oh, didn't try that.  I'm on Oculus so I always use the grips as hold and much prefer it that way.  I feel like if you are locked on the controls you should stay locked whether it's a grip or a snap, but I also can understand why they'd make a breakaway distance so that folks wouldn't get confused as to why they can't move their hands to their canopy or whatever.

But the important part here is it gives me a glimpse into why you don't like the controls.  I currently grab the stick wherever and then move my hand to a resting position; you don't even have that option if there's a breakaway threshold.  Most of the advantages that the game has in using a rotational control scheme (they don't use position at all in determining your controls, only the tilt) are lost if you can't freely re-position your controllers.

&gt; And ground vehicles need fixing - player position should be fixed relative to the car, currently you are stationary and the car just bounces all around you.

While I'd rather have it the other way (as I said in my previous post) it needs to be an option.  The reason it is how it is right now is for folks with ""motion"" sickness (really horizon sickness in this case).  It's not a thing that needs ""fixing"" in the way you say, it was a very intentional decision by the team.",oculus

The quest has much better optics than CV1, and the Rift S has even better still. The issue with getting another S is that I can just use the CV1 for desktop gaming.

Quest being wire free is really a big deal. Try playing room scale Thrill of the Fight on rift/rift S and you'll see how much better it is with Quest just by virtue of being able to jump and fly around the ring. Add to it the portability of bringing it where you want and play anywhere in your house without any real setup.

I preordered a Rift S earlier this year and ended up returning it for a refund because I didn’t think it was much of an upgrade.  The higher resolution was nice but the audio and tracking were nowhere as good.  Using OTT and applying a bit more SS to my cv1 pretty well gave me almost as good a result.  Also the cv1 oled screens are much better in apps with dark backgrounds.  My IPD is 68mm so the mechanical adjustment on the cv1 works better for me as well.

I found the biggest improvement to VR for me was to simply get a better desktop gaming PC (i9 9900k, gtx1080ti, 32gb 3000 ram, 1tb ssd, 4tb hd).  This has allowed me to increase SS and VR game settings significantly and made my Rift cv1 seem like a new headset.

So if I were you I would look at spending $’s to improve your PC performance.

I also have an Oculus Go and I really like this for media, quick VR fixes, and very handy for traveling.  I don’t really need a higher powered mobile VR headset right now but if I did I would probably consider a Quest.

he thinks of things to do that are useful but not complicated. and becasue it's useful you think he's a genius. he is not a genius. 

an example of something useful would be a wirelss usb for usb C to transmit the new quest link data so wire free. the same limitations would apply at 2.4ghz/5ghz as apply now. if you transmit at those frequencies you have limitations because it cannot carry enough data. so the current options for wireless VR use high energy 20ghz to carry the data or we get VD which is great but not perfect. usb has an abilit to handle 5gbps so it should be fine to carry the data but we are limited by the fact usb wireless transmitting uses a single transmitter and receiver for all the data so we have the same limitations of anyy wireless data transmission. 

USB 3 has 12 channels so a simple solution would be a seperate transmitter for each usb data channel and run them at different wireless data channel frequencies within the 5ghz range and that gives you 12x the data would have otherwise, All it would take would be some basic trial and error to get them working. 

Now if i had the cash to inject into investigating this idea and designed it then came up with a fantastic cheap energy efficient solution which revolutionised the wireless VR experience, would you consider me a genius?

&gt; Awarded VR Lifetime Achievement, Not 'Satisfied' With Pace

Im with you on this. I think it is why I am so excited for the likes of Boneworks, that truly look like experiences that can only be had in VR. Im also looking forward to Stormland, and been enjoying the heck out of B2VR regardless of the lackluster VR implementation.   


That being said my two most memorable, immersive and arguably favourite gaming experiences of the past 5 years have both been flat games. Metro Exodus and The Outer Worlds. TOW is the current title taking up all my time. The level of polish, story telling, choice, character, world-building. I could gush about this one all day, I freaking love it (Fallout 3/4 and New Vegas are tied in my top 5 best gaming experiences of all time, so that's where I am coming from). I might as well add Red Dead Redemption 2 to that list. I played it a bit on a friends PS4, but just grabbed it for PC and can already tell it is going way up on that list. The day built from the ground up AAA VR games are of same quality and held to the same standard as the likes of those two, I will have no problem ditching my flat gaming library and playtime. I should mention that my gaming monitor is 34 inch curved ultrawide 120hz paired with a surround system, so my flat gaming experience is more immersive than most.   


VR is no doubt my favourite way to engage with gaming content. That being said I still play most of my games and spend most of my time engaging in content on my monitor. I would say about 20 to 30% of gaming time is VR and the other 70 to 80% is flat. Mostly attributed to the recent release of Asgards and B2VR, I imagine as the content continues to come (Stormland, Boneworks, Valves Flagship titles, Walking Dead Saints and Sinners, Lone Echo 2 etc), my VR playtime will stay the same/increase with it. Even then the fact Cyberpunk 2077 or Diablo 4 (arguably the two upcoming games giving me reason to live lol), have absolutely no chance of being made for VR (Diablo 4 more so, it just wouldn't work well in that format. 2077 may have a chance, wayyy, wayyyy down the line), make it hard for me to see the current reality of my VR use changing much over the years.   


I do hope I am wrong though because I indeed do feel that playing games in VR is in every way superior to my flat gaming experience, where immersion, and mechanics are involved. Give me Red Dead 2 VR implementation and I would almost always pick that over RD2 flat mode even if those were sold as two separate versions",oculus
"I'd say that really was the case a couple of years back, but the Quest is an incredible machine that could offer some brilliant experiences.

A year from now we'll have lots of high quality titles that will leave most people satisfied.",oculus

"I think you're right for the most part.

Same FoV (actually a bit less I think compared to DK1) and a 1440p screen is pretty diabolical after 7 years.

However, on the flip side, tracking *has* come a long way.

DK1 was a 3dof headset, they were still figuring out how positional tracking was gonna work.

Now we have inside-out positional tracking. So in this regard, I think the pace of development has been decent. Not spectacular (full body tracking), but reasonable enough. We also have hand tracking soon to be released, albeit early stages.

We also have some decent controllers. Oculus touch was ahead of its time imo, and certainly a far cry from what was available at DK1 stage (razer hydra).

So it's been a bit of a mix and match, but the most glaringly disspaointing factor is indeed the visual experience. It's insane after 7 years to only have 1440p and same FoV. Wouldn't have expected that, I thought we'd be on 4k per eye by now with 150° FoV.",oculus
"Bethesda saw another opportunity to re-release Skyrim for $50 and tacked on some VR support that changes your character into a pair of floating hands. It's literally the bare minimum that was required from them. They never bothered to make the world more interactive &amp; friendly for VR, all changes are to the player model and menu. They then kept it as a PSVR exclusive for 6 months to really rake it in.

When they inevitably re-release Skyrim for PS5 &amp; Xbox I'm not going to be impressed by the simple task of porting a decade old game onto now PC-esque hardware yet Skyrim fans will consider it a massive accomplishment and pay another $50.

Skyrim was a pretty solid achievement back in 2011 and I applaud the effort put into it by Bethesda. It's just that Skyrim VR could have been something significantly better, it feels like one of those virtual tours you can do, once you really try to feel the world the limitations of the reality become pretty clear.",oculus

"You should *really* consider upgrading to Windows 10. Windows 7 will reach end of support in three months from now. That means no more security updates. That is very bad if you continue to use it.

Carmack admits himself that he is not as much a managerial type. You probably need to be to broaden your impact to the degree that Elon has. 

I think Carmack might be smarter than Elon. Carmack is more focused but he also seems more technical. That way Elon has a wider impact but Carmack is probably the better engineer. This is only hearsay, but several people who have worked closely with Elon have said that his technical skills are not that impressive. He might have simply not been able to keep up with specifics as much as Carmack, who rather wants to remain an individual contributor. The two are probably focused on different levels of the business cycle.",oculus
"**Armadillo Aerospace**

Armadillo Aerospace was an aerospace startup company based in Mesquite, Texas. Its initial goal was to build a crewed suborbital spacecraft capable of space tourism, and it had also stated long-term ambitions of orbital spaceflight.  The company was founded by John Carmack, former co-founder and chief technical officer of id Software.

On October 24, 2008, Armadillo won $350,000 by succeeding in the Level 1 Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge.

"I agree that VR is likely stuck in that “chicken and egg” situation, a mismatch between investment required to move forward and user engagement. 

I do also feel that we could likely be a bit further ahead without radical investment into all new technologies. From a raw visual standpoint, it does feel like things could’ve been pushed father by now. We’ve seen so many panels shown off over the last few years with sky high resolutions and 120Hz refresh rates, yet both of the mainstream headsets (Rift S and Index) this year fell back to LCDs with fairly pedestrian resolution for 2019. Valve Index is quite impressive overall in pushing optics and refresh rate, but for the price I would’ve imagined something more along the lines of the HP Reverb resolution by now. 

I‘d say Rift and Vive, and even GearVR, were something of a painful realization for the VR industry. While nobody was realistically expecting smartphone numbers out of the gate (...well some were I suppose), and the adoption rates certainly weren’t *catastrophically* bad, I think it’s safe to say they all came in way **way** lower than the industry was anticipating. Low enough that display manufacturers never bothered to put most of those high res VR displays into mass production, promising startups were closing down left and right, and many indie devs were left struggling after their big bet didn’t pay off. It’s likely this current market reality that’s caused such a slowdown in the pace of progress, even if it’s ironically part of the reason consumers have been sitting out VR.",oculus
"You can, but it's an ""involved"" process, requiring spudgers etc.  Easy to mess up.  Definitely not advisable under warranty.  There have been cases where dirt has gotten inside the lens housing.  Even out warranty it's probably best to reach out to support first.

"Make sure post a pic of that sweet, unopened box on here for us....",oculus
"That’s a bit of a double edged sword though, much to /u/refusered’s point. Quest may be that device that unlocks the potential of VR for you and many others, whether it’s due to the lack of cables or the convenience. But that freedom has also brought a significant penalty in hardware - having 10x lower performance than even the minimum spec for PC VR is absolutely a limitation that will hold back compelling content. I don’t think jacking into a PC is the answer there, as then you’ve lost that PC free magic and are back to where PC VR has been all along. 

There are a lot of great ideas and compelling games that simply won’t be possible on the Quest hardware. Not to say there aren’t great experiences today and won’t be more, but the hardware **will** inevitably limit how much impact Quest can ultimately have. Imagine if you can just pick up a Quest and play games like Lone Echo or Asgard’s Wrath tether free and without a gaming PC - that won’t be happening for a long time.",oculus

"Counterpoint regarding low resolution and field of view: that really doesn't have much to do with lack of progress on VR (there are headsets out there with higher res displays and larger FOV), rather it has more to do with lack of the necessary computing horsepower to deliver a better visual experience at a reasonable cost.  
  
Not even the top of the line GTX 2080 Ti can handle dual 4k at 90 FPS. In fact, the entire reason the Rift S has the resolution and refresh rate it does is because Oculus wanted to keep the minimum system requirements reasonable.  
  
There are technologies in the works to help offset the need for crazy powerful graphics cards, such as eye tracking and FOViated view, but those are complicated techs that require additional CPU power and additional components. That means they are basically sacrificing resources (CPU and cost) for gains in another resource (graphics).",oculus

"I think your missing my point, I'm not presenting myself as being intellegent. I'm presenting myself as being not stupid while stating that carmack is not a genius. he is logical and a psychopath.

I can't really answer you're thoughts on me understanding a spec sheet without actually know what you mean by that. However I am going to assume you mean when it comes to usb 3 and it's 12 channel/wires which it sends data down.

This data is reprsented by electrons or electrons converted to photons then converted to electrons in the case of oculus link cable buyt i will talk in terms of electrons because the theory is the same.

so with link basically you have 12 channels which these elevtrons transmit down and the at the other end you have a collection of what is essentially twists and turns and areas of discharge(charge) of energy which translate the electrons into a particular and specific energy state. there will be a device in the headset which electrons of this particular energy state interact with in order cause a diischarge of light and sound etc from the headset. When it comes to wireless what you need is a device/material which contains it's own twists and turns and areas of discharge which the electrons interact with which radiates energy at particular timings and energy levels and another device/material which interacts with the specific type of radiation to in turn translate that signal into electrons with specific features(due to it's own twists and turns) which in turn interact with the device in the headset which results in the sensory output we can ourselves interact with(light/sounds etc).

 in the quest some of this happens via software on the hard drive. the hard drive is something which contains particular grooves etc which is part of the process of translating electrons into sensory information.

anyway. each of the 12 channels in a usb could have their own wireless transmitter or receiver which each work in different channels(to prevent congestion of channels) which would allow us to overcome the data cap and congestion we see when we send usb data over wireless channels which are full.

Could i do this right away or am I currently aware of what these transmitters or receivers would contain physically.... no. As i said you have to follow a trial and error methodology of trying different matierals etc over a course of time to get what you need. Although i could educate myself in electronics and then i would have the ability to do this. 

My idea is sound!

Your understanding of basic physics is not! This is literally high school level physics.

the principles behind how to do this is actually also how all electronic tech works and your brain for that matter, the devices of tranlation are different is all. A power source and a whole lot of twists and turns and materials which ultimately end with the energy being translated into the sensory information which the physical features of your body such as the cones/rods in your eyes or the tympanic membrane in your ears can interact with. Think of keyboards/microphones etc as sensory input for computers etc.

IF you mean something else then please tell me?

if your understanding of how it works is different then please explain your thought process?

Companies like Valve and HTC are producing hardware that caters to a niche group that is already part of a niche market. This in no way helps to drive mainstream consumer adoption, and therefore hinders competition and innovation.

Next, download[ Vivecraft](http://www.vivecraft.org/). It's a mod that adds VR support to Minecraft Java Edition. The Vivecraft implementation of VR is far superior to the official Minecraft VR edition from the Oculus Store. You would think a user-created mod would be clunkier than the official version, but it's the complete opposite. Minecraft Java Edition + Vivecraft mod for VR has better VR visuals, more VR options (including a range of different locomotion options), better VR controls, and better VR user-interface.  
  
Minecraft Java Edition also has robust mod support. So after you have Vivecraft installed, you can then download a shader mod like [Continuum](https://continuum.graphics/) that seriously boosts the visuals of Minecraft, and then get a texture pack that has cleaner or higher-res textures. I personally like [PureBDcraft](https://bdcraft.net/). It has a very clean, sharp, colorful, and slightly comic-bookish look, and it's available in a range of different resolutions.  
  
There are a ton of [shader mods](https://www.pcgamer.com/best-minecraft-shaders/) and [texture packs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs) for Minecraft Java Edition to customize the appearance to your taste. You can definitely turn Minecraft Java Edition into one of the [most gorgeous games on the market](https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/08/Minecraft-shaders-1.14-Chocapic13s-Shaders.png).  
  
Just a word of caution about that. Minecaft + VR + shaders + high-res textures can require a seriously high-end PC. IIRC, for my Vivecraft installation of Minecraft, I think I'm using [Chocapic's Shaders](http://shadersmods.com/chocapic13s-shaders-mod/) because it's free and it offers a variety of different performance versions. The Lite version will still get you a prettier sky and water without killing your framerate.",oculus

"&gt; I imagine if you had told John at E3 2012 (with his duct taped 720p Pre-DK1 Prototype) that 7 years later his company would launch a brand new product with a similar FOV and a single 1440p LCD...he would have put you in a sleeper hold

I disagree, he would probably tell you he knows and then detail the roadmap. Carmack is a visionary who is constantly looking towards the future. This is exactly what he was talking about in his acceptance speech. He was saying as far back as the DK1 prototypes that something like the Quest needed to exist for wider adoption.",oculus
Two VR‘s? Are you kidding me,oculus
"Minecraft Java Edition (it's a different code base than Minecraft from the Oculus Store, which is based on Minecraft Bedrock Edition codebase) has robust mod support. With the right combo of shader mods and texture packs, Minecraft can easily be turned into one of the [best looking games](https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/08/Minecraft-shaders-1.14-Chocapic13s-Shaders.png) on the market.",oculus

How is the laptop for VR? I’m considering a desktop replacement for my next system.,oculus
Nice decanter!,oculus
"I've been working on the Vive and Rift for a long time now, the Quest is mostly for entertainment and testing.

I have to say though, the Quest is by far my favorite way to play, since I don't really have a lot of space.",oculus

Still waiting for it to out in oculus store :P,oculus
"Same, Just came here to see if theres a release time",oculus
"What kind of response is this lol

You're saying that because I presented supporting points that my argument is rendered invalid? You gave a one sentence opinion with nothing to back it up...

I was hoping for an actual dialog about the VR market and the ways that Oculus is helping/hurting the future of this industry. I see instead I'm just getting low-effort trolled.",oculus

Will there be a Quest version?,oculus
The rift S requires a dedicated graphics card with displayport.,oculus
"No.

I don't think and of the MacBook Air's have a dedicated video card so it's not going to have anywhere near the power to run VR.

You could conceivable buy an eGPU to plug into it if the model you have supports that but it's expensive and honestly just cheaper to build a desktop.

Quest is stand alone if you wanted to try VR without the hassle of a PC.",oculus
"I was hoping you'd stop supporting a billion dollar monopoly who wants to restrict your free speech by regulating device ids with a nebulous code of conduct that bans all offensive language without defining any specific word.

But you'd rather get cheap hype games that only feature one unique element.",oculus
If I'm correct it should came out at 11AM US time. It came out at 11 AM in Europe o nsteam and vive. So we need wait 40 min if I'm right :),oculus
"You say it like it makes a difference, you got a lot to learn",oculus
What are your comp specs?,oculus
"I have a 4770 / 16GB Ram / Vega 56 system at the minute. But when it does come time to upgrade (another 18 months I think) I wouldn’t mind a more portable solution. Assuming CPU throttling isn’t too bad these days. 

I had a desktop replacement with a core 2 duo and Hd3650M (iirc) back in the day that I was quite happy with. Mostly because au could take it to a mates house easily.",oculus
4 bucks?  I only see it for £120,oculus
My pc can barely run the original rift,oculus
"The official link cable is the same length as the Rift S.

And you can break the Rift S cable as well.

I think the biggest reason to use the Link cable is if you already own a Quest and want a cheap-ish way to try PCVR.",oculus
"Project Cars 2 is a nice game, but it's mainly circuits ... you have 2 long tracks, one base on the azure coast, and another on fictional, Bannochbrae, that is a mix of road/circuit. Nordsliefe is also very long.

For what you want, I think it's better assetto, that the vanilla version has only circuits, but you have lot's of mods with panoramic tracks, like TRANSFAGARASAN

Both are quite cheap on sales, and totally woth.

You have also City Car Driving, unique on it's kind, but graphics are not so nice.",oculus
"Just look on ebay or key selling sites where you also buy your steam games  ;)
I saw offers for 2,89 up there :)",oculus
"Consider that the world isn't black and white, that a company can be doing both good things and bad things. That people who like those good things understand and want to also talk about the bad things in situations of honest discourse and not one-sentence quips, tribalism, and low-effort trolling.

&gt;  who wants to restrict your free speech by regulating device ids with a nebulous code of conduct that bans all offensive language without defining any specific word.

Oh, you're one of those guys. Are you an alt of TootsyPooper or something? Upset because you got banned for statements of overt sexism and/or racist remarks?

Yep, from two replies you now completely understand my political and personal opinions and are able to categorically define me as an individual, and thus can pass judgment on my moral failings and ignorant choices. Thank god we have people like you around here.

Take your complaints and trollbait to someone who cares to listen. If anyone else is interested in having a real adult discussion about the pros and cons of Facebooks involvement in the VR industry, please comment below.",oculus

"the ""vr is dead"" crowd is drooling all over this article in /r/pcgaming",oculus
"I have a class with a VR developer an the Oculus touch controllers do basically the same thing quite well minus a couple fingers, but you get a better experience with the touch controllers in his opinion. When factoring in the cost it's definitely not worth it.",oculus
"Streaming to the Quest over WiFi is very dependent on your router, network and environment (how many other people around you are using wireless equipment).

It's useless to argue about perceived quality. As you note, people will perceive the same circumstances differently. But you are most likely not having the same experience in the first place.

The goal of using a physical cable in the first place is to minimize these errors and issues.",oculus
Why is that disheartening? Their ignorance is only affecting themselves.,oculus
I don't know where you live but locally here (Midwest US) a CV1 wouldn't sell for more than $150. The cable breaking and leaving the headset unusable is a deal breaker.,oculus
"That happened on mine too, but everything else works fine. I'm going to glue it back on and forsake thumb detection until either something more major breaks, or I get a new headset.",oculus
"You can technically pay for something like Shadow gaming, and play PCVR remotely. My friend did this until a couple months ago when I convinced him to build a PC and stop spending $30 a month to rent a PC when he could own one just as powerful for like $500-$800 and be able to upgrade it yearly for the same price as shadow.",oculus
3pm isn't a normal release time for Oculus stuff.,oculus
Doubtful.,oculus
"Unless it's an exception to the rule, games typically release at 10am EST. So it'll be available after 6PM",oculus
"Your cable is probably dying like everyone else's. If you're in warranty get it replaced, if not you may be left with a paper weight as Oculus has abandoned support for it.",oculus
"Or even just rotate it from the window. I personally just throw some clothes over it, and done with it ( hat, Tshirt, stuff like that :D ).",oculus
Odd last labyrinth is out today  and available  so why not this?,oculus
Ok boomer,oculus
Do you mean EST (eastern)? There's 4 time zones in the continental US,oculus
Also I am waiting for it so don't lecture me,oculus
"Hoping I can get others to pop into this, looks equally as fun as IronWolfVR is!",oculus
"this is the beta release, when  you go onto beta, it installs update, then asks you to update drivers,  for me once its completed updating drives, oculus window opens again, and it still wants me to update drivers,   i then cant use an VR things not even oculus home,  so i had to opt out of the beta, to go back to version 1.42 and then everything works again.",oculus
Texture pack and shaders name?,oculus
"**Assetto Corsa** with the LA Canyons and traffic mods  
** Dirt Rally2.0** rally stages are all set in absolutely gorgeous settings and you can drive them as slow as you want and enjoy the scenery, also allows free-roaming of Dirtfish (big ass dirt driver training facility in Washington)  
**City Car Driving**  
**American/Euro Truck Simulator** (both have car mods)   
GTA5 has mods you can use wheel/shifter/pedals****",oculus
"Fallout 4 requires some pretty heavy modding to even be playable in VR, the DLC aren't included or supported (however can be modded in), there's random clipping of textures, the world scaling is borked (giant hands, heads dependant on the player scale) and it's otherwise an unremarkable experience.

Menu navigation is slightly better and it's kind of cool having a wrist mounted Pip-Boy however the gunplay is fairly lacking in VR (scopes blank the screen by default). The Fallout world isn't exactly pretty either, it's so much brown and grey that you get bored of the environment very quickly.

Skyrim on the other hand is pretty sweet, Dual wielding works fine and archery feels fairly realistic (albeit other games do this much better), magic works pretty well too. Melee feels pretty flat but that's the same in Fallout, the engine simply wasn't built with those kind of physics in mind. The world in Skyrim is more vibrant and the performance is substantially better, with a long list of mods it can look pretty spectacular too.",oculus
"That's absolutely a good reason to get a portable solution, I would suggest the Quest at that point though, it's absolutely the best for playing with your mates.  
I have been playing HL VR on it with a couple of friends, casting it to the TV and I loved it!",oculus
You got me excited. i thought it was finally available,oculus
Have you tried something like RiftCat?,oculus
"It's ok man, I understand you. I don't care about solid argumenting either, I want people to know that I am BETTER than them. I want them to know that even though they throw facts, solid reasoning and counter arguments to my one liner points that in the end they will be WRONG and I will always be RIGHT. These people man, they are sheep, they rather play games while we're fighting a revolution, we're the voice of a generation man. Who cares what they say about facebook being both evil and good, advancing technology while also infringing on our privacy and meddling into international affairs. I want to focus on the part that makes my point more valid than theirs and if I cannot argument then I WILL make them know that I am BETTER. They argue about the technology aspect, well guess what bozo? Zuckerberg is literally evil so your whole argument is VOID. These people man.... they'll NEVER be like us, they are already gone man, we're like the resistance from the Terminator movies, except we don't need laser guns, we have holier than thou tactics that render all the ROBOTS in this sub powerless. And if all fails? We nuke em with a one word reply: ""Jesus"".... we let them know that whatever diatribe they just diatribed was all for naught, we have judged them much like God judges mortals. We are better, we are faster, we do not care for logic, we know the name of the lord... and we're not afraid to use it.",oculus
No lollygagging.,oculus
"60 a year is good, but I feel like you can get the most value in one or two months playing all the good games on there, then wait a year and do it again. If you want to take your time with games, though, this could be an enticing option.",oculus
A smaller userbase affects VR as a whole.,oculus
"The environments look great, but I wonder if the physics are as good as in Eleven: Table Tennis VR?",oculus
It’s a 3D game but the monitor is 2D hence the image has to be projected to two dimensions. It’s more noticeable when comparing to VR where you get a stereoscopic 3D image.,oculus
11/10,oculus
"We're going to need a slow montage of still images of you playing, slowly moving past and transitioning while ""in the arms of the Angel"" plays in the background.",oculus
So does a larger one. When there is mass adoption you'll miss the old days. I already am seeing so many high pitched kids coming along lately.,oculus
"It is my opinion, there is no argument. Especially against people who write a lot of nothing to bully me into agreeing.

You want to get into a quote war where you just throw my points back at me? I don't, I understand how the internet works.",oculus

What does one do with those created galaxies?,oculus

"It didn't die, it was bought by Facebook",oculus

"Yeah Eleven really just *feels* so right. I think they are working on a major update too, though who knows when it'll be out.",oculus
It just appeared in the Coming Soon &amp; Pre-Order Section. A little late if you ask me,oculus
Nothing there yet.... 4pm GMT.....,oculus
"where the hell is the game, not even telling us why it's delayed",oculus
"Via Steam, you can choose to play the beta, which has updated physics (but is unfinished).",oculus
It works and its portable.  Id give it a 10,oculus
"Oh yeah, that comes out in two days. Fair reminder.",oculus
"Interesting, [exploration video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNODj6pNNSw) for anyone else unfamiliar with this game.",oculus
But what is a helmet going to do at that point?,oculus
"You are wrong. First iPhone was very limited in comparison to other smart phones that already existed, like Symbian. It lacked basic functions like copy/paste and bunch of others.
 


The only difference was the touch screen. Symbian existed in 2003 and it was vastly superior to regular phones, but no one was interested to buy. This is the situation with VR today. People buy what's popular, not what's good",oculus
"Someone else from Iran posted in /r/oculusquest and it seems that you can't use the store in your country. Either due to US sanctions or blocking of Facebook's servers, or possibly both.

You'd have to run a VPN to have any hope of getting content, and you can't run a VPN directly on the Quest. You'd have to run one either on your router directly, or on your pc or phone and then use that as a WiFi hotspot for the quest.",oculus
"My thoughts, exactly",oculus
"oh it does? nevermind, im dumb then lol",oculus
It's been confirmed to release November 14th for a couple of months now.,oculus
yes and I give it a 10/10,oculus
"Hmmm that didn’t work. Let me try again but harder.



JESUS",oculus
What are some absolutely amazing ones they've made? never seen them talked about before stormland and I never played any of their games.,oculus
I've heard it has PIN protection. Just in case,oculus
"I have an ultrawide as well to help with the ""immersion"" factor of desktop PC gaming and I'm looking forward to the same titles as you. I do hope they can deliver something truly great, especially Boneworks and Stormlands since they are the most immediate big releases for single player IP's.",oculus
"I still wonder if I can get past the initial setup, does it require WiFi for the setup? Because after the setup I’ll just use my PC’s hotspot with a vpn.",oculus
Looks suspicious as hell though,oculus
It's for science. Not really porn,oculus
"P\*rnHub has something similar, FWI!  :/",oculus
"You need Wifi to set it up yes, as you have to login or create an oculus account to register the device to.",oculus
"It seems it worked pretty well for the console industry. Do you have a single real world example to back your theory there friend? Because as far as I can tell, that's just what it is. A theory based on nothing more than fanboy love and/or Facebook hatred disguised as self-righteousness. 

I'm trying to keep an open mind here and I couldn't possibly give less of a shit about Facebook but that just doesn't make any sense.",oculus
Oculus support is generally pretty great. They credited my account for $10 as well in a different situation even though they had no obligation to do so.,oculus
Hey Google...,oculus
Finally! Time to fall over a lot,oculus
I used Wabbajack VR Hybrid. It's about 300 mods in there,oculus

"Hell yes. The Vive looks extremely outdated next to the Index.

Worse black levels don't excuse the gigantic clarity upgrade the Index has over the Vive.",Vive
I'd like to know the name of the game as well. Side scrollers in vr are great.,Vive
Haha exactly! It’s like virtual boy but much much much better,Vive
r/tipofmyjoystick,Vive
I played a chair in a room with friends.  We had one reluctant person in VR everyone else watching.  It was fun and definitely scarier than horror movies or haunted houses.  That game does pure roomscale as well which helped with the immersion.,Vive
"I will try, but you think they are at all familiar with indie side scrollers that have VR support? I would think the vive subreddit would be more knowledge",Vive

Thanks for posting

[Should I get a refurbished vive?](/r/Vive/comments/e4csc6/should_i_get_a_refurbished_vive/) by  pip372


I'm looking to get my first vr headset for Christmas and as a glasses wearer my friends have recommended the og vive. Thing is I can only get my hands on an HTC certified refurbished vive and I was wondering if I should get a vive even if refurbished.

"I have an OG Vive, Vive Pro Wireless, Pimax 8k, and Valve Index. The Pimax has the best visual quality, but it's very uncomfortable and has crap audio, and with the extended field of the view the edges of your peripheral vision gets too much distortion. The Index Knuckle controllers alone make it worth it over any other setup.",Vive
"Same as ever, no news of any hardware revisions have caught my eye and claiming it's a software fixable issue is just plain deceitful.",Vive
In Belgium they have shops where it is in stock https://m.alternate.be/HTC/Vive-Deluxe-Audio-Strap-opzetstuk/html/product/1350642,Vive
The Vive does not use cameras for tracking forget that Facebook spying stuff and pick up the manual.,Vive
HTC sells used kits for 350$ currently.,Vive
 lighthouses show up as those squares,Vive
"Your post made me assume that you are trying to set up the Vive with knoweledge of occulous products as you are talking about cameras. I'm in no way confused who makes what.

I haven't had that ever happen to me with 1.0 lighthouses. Do any updates show for them before you start setting up the play space?",Vive
You mean true sidescroller where you only move LR?Try Sonic Generations with Vorpx.  I can't really think of anything made for VR that's on that level.,Vive
"the last one i bought was for the xbox, where you like dangle above the ground and some chainsaw murderer is like butchering another victim in the other room, i couldn't do it lol",Vive
i'd be too afraid they would toss my HMD,Vive
If we can get games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill to vr then im into horror vr. These jump scare games aren't fun to play.,Vive
"What did you have before, and what PSU do you have? As it could be your PSU is not up to powering your new graphics card and attached USB devices at the same time.",Vive
"I'll see what I can do with my own vive, I like taking things apart so that shouldn't be a problem. But I can't start the process for a few days, so I think I'll have a first model in about a week or so.",Vive
I thought the part was from the audio strap so I could measure myself.,Vive
"I hate horror in VR, I am not a fan of it in general, and I am even slightly scared for half live alyx jump scares like the headcrap that jumps on you in the trailer",Vive
"You have to be careful not to short any electronics, but a wipe down with a slightly damp cloth wet with [Odoban](https://odoban.com/) or [Zero-oder](https://www.zeroodor.com/) and the smell will go. Do this after replacing the face mask. Consider upgrading to the deluxe audio strap if the fabric one is present.",Vive
Heard alien isolation in vr is meant to be amazing,Vive
That's some good news! Thanks. I would just need to replace it with the valve steam controllers one? Would that procedure be difficult?,Vive
Hmm it does worry me though with the current vive wands being so prone to malfunction,Vive
For the Xbox...? What vr game do you mean,Vive
Last horror game***,Vive
I thought horror vr games weren’t that bad. It’s the only way horror games get to me anymore after playing so many desktop ones. Fuck the ones where shit appears directly in your face though.,Vive
"Ohh ok lol, I’m kind of interested in knowing what it is though. Is it new? On steam?",Vive

Good answer but it isn’t that one. I have this game but it isn’t the one I am thinking of. The one I am thinking of is more recent and sort of MARIO -esque with outside areas.,Vive
can you describe the art style?,Vive
"Yeah looks like Mario, particularly the first world with outside areas made of blocks, coins to collect, power ups, etc.",Vive

"I've never done it, but I've heard it mentioned often on reddit. You could ask around here to see if anyone has a guide.",Vive
"What exactly is your definition of cheap? :)

For a flawless performance, I would speculate that having spare cores for the Wireless adapter helps. So I'd recommend a 6 or 8 core processor. A 2nd or 3rd gen AMD Ryzen 5 would be the cheapest option to get that. However, the wireless adapter is incompatible with some Ryzen mainboards, so you'd need someone to vouch for compatibility with whatever mainboard you choose for that setup.

But possibly a cheaper 4-core of the current generation of processors is also sufficient.",Vive
"Prevent reflective things in your room, like windows and mirrors.

Use the sync cable between the light houses.

Updates all firmwares?

Maybe try steamvr beta?",Vive
Not exactly the answer to you're question but [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3307170) is a great solution. Print it and buy the fan linked in the notes.,Vive
"I'm actually unsure what a PSU is, but I found out the problem was just that I had plugged it into a USB 3.0 port and it should have been in a USB 2.0 ;;",Vive
"And besides the controllers? How is Vive compared to Index hmd? I also have an og Vive and want to know if it’s worth upgrading visor and controllers, just controllers or nothing at all (as I can still enjoy vr with my vive setup)",Vive
"There is a tool known as vorpx but would not recommend as it costs quite a bit and it needs a lot of confit and sometimes doesn’t work also leaves a watermark but if that desperate u can purchase it and probably could find a config for hl1/hl2 ready made also u cannot use a be controller only an actual Xbox /Bluetooth controller and keyboard and mouse like the original oculus also it might need some mapping config this yter known as up is not jump did a video on how he did it with fallout new Vegas so here it is 
https://youtu.be/8Mo7ET7pFj4[video link](https://youtu.be/8Mo7ET7pFj4)",Vive
"Surprisingly they’re too scary for me, I watch horror films without issue, but those vr games creep me out.",Vive
"It should work fine on either, mine does, and Usb3.0 ports are really required if you want to use the camera without getting performance issues.

But a lot of people with power or timing issues report that using the 2.0 ports side steps disconnect issues, and if you don't use the camera performance is about the same.

The all important part is you can now get back to enjoying VR.",Vive
that sounds fun. I love vorpx,Vive
"As someone who used to sell on eBay, eBay basically always sides with the buyer, which is great if you’re a buyer. Once someone returned a DS lite that was sold with no battery because it didn’t turn on and eBay accepted it...",Vive
"The Index has nothing to do with Vive.

The Index is manufactured by Valve, a completely different company from HTC.",Vive
Saved for later,Vive
"one never had a problem but we also keep the house cool. I've always wondered if those who have problems live in hot areas, maybe without cranked AC",Vive
"Sure, sure. But the Vive exists solely because Valve basically commissioned it from them, but didn't have a manufacturing line of their own to produce them with.",Vive
I’ve had mine on an OG Vive since launch and have never once had an overheating issue. YMMV,Vive
Well I happen to be in the market to sell my OG Vive. Bought new in 2017. Care to deal?,Vive
"Ozone is O3, but yeah, ozone should work. Can't imagine how it would break the vive, but it's bad to breathe too much ozone, so keep that in mind.",Vive
"Not even close of a comparison. Vive, Vive Pro and Index here, Index is MILES ahead in terms of pretty much every aspect",Vive
"I'm intrigued.

But why the laser?",Vive
"Right, but I think he was commenting on the fact that the OP called it a ""Vive Index""",Vive
"Hi sorry bloody reddit wouldn't let me link the slightly nicer imgur post I made so had to re-hash the one above to link it.

[Here is the imgur one anyway](https://imgur.com/gallery/cy3C6Z5)

So it's basically a design I wanted to make for years but didn't have the willpower or patience to follow it up.

Its a modular design and probably it's best feature is the wrap-around cage for the rear controller (which tends to suffer from slight occlusion in regular under-slung magnetic designs). This normally isn't a major issue unless you are very competitive and the slight movement irritates you on long range sniping.

I wanted to make a gunstock that was also realistic in appearance and handling, this one doubles as a nice centre-piece for a VR display but also has a great extra feature, a 5mW laser which is boremounted via an extra module. The magazine is not just for looks it houses the trigger for the laser which can be simply retro-fitted after purchase if needed. The trigger comes pre-installed just in case so will sit there redundant until required.

Using apps like LaserHIT and iTarget Pro on a mobile device you can setup indoor ranges and just plink away at home using the picatinny mount on the rifle to practice your accuracy and speed. This is especially fun with the Laser M16 front sight as lining up that post and peep sight aperture is worth practicing.

I am working on free-standing laser reactive targets [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJW2bq2cjo0&amp;t=287s) that will 'ping' a metal plate / bell when hit for long range accuracy, this is where the scope will come in handy. I am privately working on wearable targets too for a possible laser-target game as these lasers can thread the needle at 200 yards, its not like normal laser target guns that actually use IR instead of lasers for safety. Of course this is only for personal use and safety glasses would need to be worn if shooting at other persons, the Class IIIa laser is considered safe if used correctly and your blink-reflex will save damage to eyes but staring into it directly will cause damage, this drops off over distance. This system involves arduino circuits and will take a while to setup so its a long term project on the side. The Laser Module will ship separately and installing and using it is at buyers own risk, obviously it is impossible to control the safe use of units sold so this is the only option available.

The rifle itself works real nice in-game and the magnetic north / south controllers snap in self-guiding for the most. I added a magnetic pump-action attachment on the front mag well. Originally I was going to do two versions of the rifle but it seemed much better to throw on an attachment instead of making people choose different rifles.

This gunstock isn't really competing against anything else on the market because it was just a personal project I wanted to get over. If anyone else is interested you can pick one up on my eBay store [here](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Beowulf-VR-Carbine-HTC-Gamer-Pro-controller-gun-stock-mount-pump-action/223503173043?hash=item3409d3c5b3:m:mC1PqTw2BqttWpRE6imNmQQ) but they are not cheap at £165 and would recommend anyone not buying one unless you have a desire to own something like this. It's definitely a functional stock that feels aesthetically realistic in-game but if performance is the only thing you are after then there are plenty of other cheaper stocks out there. I offer a budget range starting from £35 that perform really well and are dirt cheap for instance.

This thing looks absolutely amazing though I really love just walking in the room and looking at it. When you strap this thing on to play Pavlov or Onward it feels like you are about to shoot for real like paintball or something like that, it transforms the experience to a different plain.

The gunstock ships with Index and HTC Vive wand attachments as standard so no need to specifiy when ordering. Its actually great to have as a controller-holder for the other set when not in-use although a ridiculous price if that's all it was used for :O)",Vive
"For apps like [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK-llho3MlM)

Here is a [video clip of me using it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKbF9e_F2os&amp;feature=youtu.be) I will include this in main post thanks :)",Vive
"The headset is also a huge improvement over OG Vive.  Not only cleaner and no screen door, but just easier to look at for extended periods.",Vive
I have the TPCAST wireless adapter and I have not had any heating issues. I do not live in a warm country.,Vive
"I have an OG vive with audio strap and the Index. Others have explained the better controllers and visuals, but I'll specifically point out that the audio is a revelation. Overall quality is nicer, but the speakers not touching the ear is a big quality of life improvement (no discomfort, ear sweat, and can talk to people in the room with you).",Vive
Lol. Fair point!!,Vive
"It is, but to be fair I did use a comma.",Vive
Wow yeh that looks great. Thanks,Vive
Sounds up my street. Thanks,Vive
You will NOT be sorry. I can't stop playing it!,Vive
"Yeah I also wanted to comment on the ""Vive Index"" thing.",Vive
I really want wireless but not gonna pay 300€+for that.,Vive
"Well, they just refunded my payment for the controller overnight. No explanation in the refund email, but it did say something about there being a delay when I bought it because of high demand.  Darn.",Vive
"Yeah, that's why I thought this was a pretty decent deal. Though I also kind of feel like that should be the sticker price.",Vive
"I’m going to echo the other comment and say the index is remarkably better. Visually, it feels leagues better, especially with text and small detail. It’s also *much* more comfortable, and the extra field of view you can pull from it is totally noticeable and makes the whole experience just more comfortable. 

If you have the horsepower to drive the display at 120hz, that’s beautiful, beautiful icing.",Vive
You need to re-upload that file: It's heavily corrupted.,Vive
"Thank you! I should get something like that for my real stuff.
Is it available in 5,56 and .357SIG?",Vive
"Valve commissioned (licensed) it “to” them. Valve created the technology and wanted other manufacturers to build and license the lighthouse tech. HTC was the first, then Pimax.

It’s pretty clear Valve didn’t want to be in the hardware business but the partnerships weren’t driving the tech in the right direction, hence Valve decided to manufacture their own.",Vive
"Replace or wash the foam bits.  Spray with air duster, Spray a natural odor air freshener like fabrize Or use an ozium into a box and put the unit in there for a few hours. Spray with air duster again. repeat if required.",Vive
How so?,Vive
I added a 40 mm USB  fan and it never gets over Luke warm....Texas here,Vive
"Haven't used it but my buddy tried buying the preowned last night, turns out it's out of stock too atm. Just a heads up",Vive
"Lol how, I love horror VR games, their probably my favorite games to play in VR",Vive
I love them just because they really scare me!,Vive
"Good to know. I have been thinking of buying this game and have used ReVive in the past (Lone Echo, Artika1, Mages Tale, Chronos, Robo Recall, Marvel Powers United). I just upgraded to the Index (waiting for it anyway) so only buying one game. I was between Asgard's Wrath, Nostos, and Boneworks.",Vive
"Possibly, until March at least",Vive
I find covering the smell of cigarette smoke with cannabis smoke is pretty effective.,Vive
"I grabbed a ripped copy but haven't looked at how to run a ripped game on revive yet. 
I was tempted to buy it based on seeing several reddit posts talking it up. 
I just don't trust Facebook to not block revive again so I don't want games stuck on a dead platform.",Vive
Do not sit in a room with something that generates ozone. That's a bat shit idea,Vive
i7-7820x / 32GB / RTX2080 will be enough to get 120hz on Index?,Vive
"Never once had heat build up with mine. Either it’s a problem that only inflicts some hardware, or else people just don’t realize how much their head is exuding heat (directly under the adapter).",Vive
"I mean, I can get 120hz with a 6600k and a 980 on (very) low-weight games. So yes.",Vive
"Note that the Index has a fairly limited IPD range adjustment. The Vive goes all the way to 75mm, but the index only goes to 70mm.  If you have wideset eyes, this may cause you some problems.  I haven't tried the Index, although I've read if you wedge something between the lenses you can force them a bit further apart and get up to about 71.5mm.  I'm up at 73mm, so the Index is probably a no-go for me unless I want to do some serious modding.",Vive
"Guys this is the same shit Vive owners pulled for two years with the touch controllers. ""Until the knuckles release that is..."". You are annoying. We all know HL will probably be the best VR game released up until that point.

 You are adding literally nothing to the discussion and just trying to downplay how good the games that are already out are because occulus made it.

Edit: Keep on downvoting. If this is r/knucklescirclejerk then keep behaving this way. The truth is that the best hand interactions on the knuckles right now are occulus games excluding Aperture Hand Labs. If you guys aren't playing these I'm wondering what you are playing with your index and having immersive hand interactions.

Edit 2: lol thought I was on r/valveindex I get why you guys are mad now.",Vive
"Given my personal *horrible* experience with HTC support on *multiple* occasions, I would rather eat broken glass than buy a refurbished item directly from HTC.

Also, that's the same price as a new Rift S. HTC insane pricing as usual.",Vive
"I previously played on my vive with an R9 390, which is somewhat comparable to the 970, and it was servicable but not great. I had a different CPU though (3770k), so I'm not sure what your experience will be. I expect simple games will run alright, but don't expect to be running skyrim with mods.

I could be wrong though, hopefully someone with this setup can give you a better idea.

Cheers!",Vive
"If you mean the laser you can just buy a bore mounted laser ammo round, I think you can buy them online real cheap. Good way to train although I think the ones for real rifles and handguns have to be manually recocked each shot as the laser in those fires when the firing pin hits the laser round. If you have a double-action you are probably ok though :)",Vive
"I bought mine a few weeks ago, it came without earbuds or the base station mounts, other than that no problems so far",Vive
How heavy/comfortable do you think the index is compared to the original w/ audio strap?,Vive
There is no way I'd buy anything other than the Index at this point.,Vive
"1. You can change the barrier types for you chaperone in the menus so you down have the giant grid. 
2. I found that using USB 3.0 ports works better for the system. 
3. Read the manual about how your light houses link. If they dont have line of sight of each other you may need to use the link cable for them. 
4. Dont let your friends play super hot next to anything breakable, (And if you play Hotdog Horseshoes and Handgrenades and have a low ceiling, throw the grenades underhanded. punching  a glass lightshade and having it fall on you and shatter while you cant see it isnt fun) 
5. They make silicone protectors for your headset and controllers to protect from smacking things. (mine have survived windows, lightshades and desk punches.). 
6. If you look straight up or straight down you headset may lose tracking, its normal, you didnt break it. 
7. Your vive has a built in camera and it may set itself as your default camera for things like skype. It may also set its microphone as the default as well. 
8. The included audio connector for earbuds can be removed so it doesnt dangle around if you use a wireless headset. you just need to unplug it. ([how to remove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MigWitzU_oE))
9. Make sure to set your pupilary distance using the knob on the headset, if things look blurry you may want to adjust it. 
10. In the vr menues in steam home you can change your avatar, light house shape, background, chaperone color and many other things. I use the portal cameras as my light house designs. Theres a lot of things you can customize.

That's the bulk of what I think would be helpful. Mainly the dont punch things and get some protectors for at least your controllers.",Vive
"I have a 970, you can play most games but just not on high settings, still loads of fun, some light mods in Skyrim. I am on a rift CV1 and rift s though so it won’t be identical, but close enough. To what you’ll experience",Vive
I'll sell you mine if you like. PM me if you want to work something out.,Vive
It's better than Skyrim?,Vive
I really appreciate the help!!!,Vive
Super helpful advice!!!! Thank you a ton!,Vive
"I can 't recommend the original vive even at the certified pre-owned price. The improvements from 1st gen VR to ""2nd"" gen, is huge. The sde and resolution is horrible on the vive and I despise the wands. While I'm not a huge fan of the rift s, its simply a better HMD and you can get it brand new at the same price.",Vive
"I’ve tried ignorning it and changing the position of the light houses, the tracking issues seem to have decreased.

The firmware is all up to date and I’ve also reinstalled SteamVR but the issue carried on.

I haven’t seen any indications of the issue fixed for the beta on the changelog but I might give it a try.

I’m unfamiliar with a sync cable though.",Vive
Maybe you can use that to your advantage.  Leave your hands behind so that they're shooting from one direction while you walk around the corner and flank them from the other side.,Vive
Its amazing. The graphics are OUT OF THIS WORLD...Not from a 10 year old game or however old SKyrim is...,Vive
u/kozio_,Vive
Get it TODAY!!! The first scene in the ocean alone is worth the price of admission...,Vive
Well once you mod Skyrim so everything has 4k textures it looks almost photorealistic.,Vive
"Just double checked and tried them both on again for ya :D Index feels a bit heavier and blockier, actually.

But this little test really drove home the overall difference in comfort (haven't played the Vive for a couple months now). 

The index face coushins win, smoother and comfier and can be swapped easily with magnet attachments. Index adjustment is smoother and knobs/sliders feel more solid (though I put hundreds of hours on the Vive, might just be wear). And yeah, clicking the Vive ear pieces into place made me a tiny bit claustrophobic and appreciate the index speakers even more.",Vive
It's called Face Your Fears 2. You would have to use revive to play it unless you have an oculus headset.,Vive
"My wife has done that a few times, i had to tell her off! Lol",Vive
Make sure you don't have any plans for 6-8 hours. You will not want to put it down.,Vive
No wireless on Index is a no buy for some of us.  I did pick up the knuckles though.,Vive
It's on sale for $250 now.  You can also find for less sometimes on eBay.,Vive
I don't think even it came with those back when I bought a brand new vive. Those were always accessories I thought.,Vive
Mine came with them.,Vive
"If you are not used to VR, Take it slowly. Some get their vr legs very quickly. Others take some time. If you feel nauseous don't try to push through that. It will just make it worse.
Take a break. Drink some Ginger and go back to it once the nauseousness resides.

Have fun",Vive
Dreadhalls is just next level scary.,Vive
"VTOL VR is the only flight sim type game that fits that description, but it’s modern day style stuff. Still a very fun game.",Vive
Yeah mine came in the box. I bought my Vive through Craigslist but there were spots for them in the box.,Vive
And the app itself is free or do I need to buy that one too?,Vive

Yep the basic versions are and you can buy extras too if you want more variety. There's quite a few physical targets you can buy that react to laser shots but they are between £100-£300 so really pricey for what you get.,Vive

Guess I just never noticed them then.,Vive

OG lenses are called fresnel or frensel lenses. They have rings on them that both blue peripheral vision and catch light like a motherfucker making godrays in certain environments

Custom lenses solve both these problems albeit with a slight FOV loss but I dont notice it.

"Why would you buy a 3 year old headset, when you can get newer ones for a similar price (Rift S, Quest, Odyssey...)? Unless you absolutely need the lighthouse tracking.",Vive
Don’t buy a used vive. But a rift S.,Vive
Im selling my vive if anyone is interested in the UK. £300,Vive
The cpu will give you problems.  I had one and it did not work well for vr,Vive
I am interested in this as well.  I've never tried connecting wireless headphones but mine always get in the way so I want to switch.,Vive
"Thanks for flagging, just picked up Skyrim.  I feel like deals on these larger games are becoming less frequent as VR becomes more popular.",Vive

"Came here to say the exact same thing. HTC support  was so bad that I will never give them any money in the future. In my case, my vive was defective right out of the box. In they end they never did mak it right after months of back and forth and I would up haivng to purchase the replacement lighthouse on my own dime. 

They closed my case without even shipping my efecitve unit back to me. 

terrible...",Vive
"That sounds very cool, but not quite what I'm looking for at the moment. Looking basically for a game that will let me drive a nice convertible down a highway.",Vive
"If you play something sweaty, make sure to take breaks and wipe it down, and especially under the nose guard, where it likes to accumulate.",Vive
I second the general feelings here.  Get a Quest and do oculus link (my recommendation) or a rift s. If you really want the tracking that the Vive has IMO save up for the index.  HTC support is crap.  If you absolutely want a vive check out amazon refurbished so at least you have a way to easily return it.,Vive
I would say quivr,Vive
"I ordered mine on thursday night and it got here saturday afternoon, other than being a little dirty everything in the kit seems fine. Came with proper packaging, and missing the base station mounts, but there was a card in the package indicating that it wasn't supposed to come with it.

edit: also the pre-owned ones are out of stock, too. It shows that it isn't but when you try and add it to your cart it says out of stock.",Vive
"See kids, this is why you keep your headset in the office and your fun-time candles in the basement...

Really though, if you're careful enough you might be able to get away with it on the lenses too, but personally I would try a soft plastic scraper (cut up some soda bottle or something like that) and try to take it off cold. I'd be worried about molten wax seeping through the seams and getting on the panel because that would be a bitch to clean.",Vive
No not at all,Vive
"the vive line offers an actual path to upgrade, you can spend $350 to get in the door and you have the option of upgrading your HMD, and controllers when/if you want.

"i bought a  recertified cosmos from amazon. Everything was fully intact, only the cables werent wound like new. the headset still had the camera covers on it. so all in all, i think it was a pretty decent deal.., and it was almost half price. lucky i guess",Vive
"Hate to say this, but it sounds like you might have a serious problem with your HMD.  Best thing I can suggest is to bypass the wireless unit with the original cable for now and see if you can get it working.

Also before you declare your HMD fucked, try a different graphics card as I've had experience (and ended up buying a 2nd HMD because of this) of graphics cards stopping working in VR while still working perfectly in desktop, and getting loads of different error messages from Steam vr.",Vive
"What would you recommend on a budget? I'll need a new CPU, mobo and ram, the rest i can bring with me.",Vive
Could I try a small silicone spatula? Would that risk scratching the lens? I'm just concerned about damaging the lenses with plastic. And it was a scented Yankee candle that was knocked off of my shelf by mistake. So the headset smells lovely now if nothing else,Vive
Just give me how much you can spend and I'll find the best stuff for the price,Vive
"Plastic shouldn't be nearly hard enough to scratch the glass if it doesnt have any grit embedded in it. That silicone one might do it for you, but if not you could try something like the spatula from a George Forman grill, the Spudgers that come with phone repair kits or a guitar pick, that kind of material. 

But yeah, the silicone is probably a good start, especially if you can heat the wax just a bit to soften it but not melt it.",Vive
€250 max. Any more and my wife would kill me. :) Also im in ireland if that helps.,Vive
"You cant really get anything VR ready for that price, unless you buy used (and even then, its gonna be close)",Vive
"Hey, I got the refurb kit as well!  Just came in the mail yesterday.

You'll probably have to pair your controllers manually through SteamVR once you get everything plugged in.  I had to charge mine before I could pair them, but it shouldn't take too long (think an hour or so).  Other than that I followed the setup wizard through HTC's site and it was pretty straightforward.",Vive
[This](https://youtu.be/xdZ9N8YdpaI) is the kind of thing you can buy. If you search Amazon or eBay in your country for 'laser target' and you'll get a few come up.,Vive
"Okay, I'm not very knowledgeable on Ireland's normal computer prices or popular stores.  From what I found, [this cpu](https://www.custompcparts.ie/cpus/processors/amd-ryzen-5-2600-processor-3-4-ghz-box-16-mb-l3.ireland.direct.gaming.components#.XeQMF-hKhjU) with [this motherboard](https://www.custompcparts.ie/motherboards/motherboards/msi-b450m-pro-m2-max-motherboard-socket-am4-micro-atx-amd-b450.ireland.direct.gaming.components#.XeQMR-hKhjU) and [this ram](https://www.custompcparts.ie/memory/memory-desktop-pcs/crucial-ballistix-sport-lt-memory-module-8-gb-ddr4-3000-mhz.ireland.direct.gaming.components#.XeQNnehKhjU) looks to be about the best you can do. It is very slightly over 250 but pretty damn close.  having 2 4GB memory sticks would be better but those seemed to be more expensive.  Again the site I used might not be the best but at least you can get an idea of what kind of parts you should look for",Vive
Same,Vive
its just cpu mobo ram not a whole computer,Vive
"1.Never expose the lenses of the Vive to sunlight, it will destroy the screen.

2.Depending on your body, using an aftermarket VR face pad such as those pleathers might be a bad idea if u sweat alot as it cannot absorb foam and might cause sweat to enter your HMD and kill it. A dirty face pad is better than a dead HMD.

3. Take a rest if u are sweating too much / put a fan nearby.

4. Be extra carefull if u are wearing glasses in your vive. U might scratch it. Use persciption lens adapters such as WidmoVR.

5. Do not clean the lens with your shirt as it might cause scratches, try not to clean the lenses as often if possible.

6. Becarefull about turning too much until you twist the cable, it can damage the internals of the cable. Use application such as turn signal to keep track of your turning so you won't turn too much on one side.

7. Do not move the base-station when they are in operation. You might damage it and cause calibration issues.",Vive

Got my Vive in June 2016 and it came with ear buds. I didn't find them very comfortable so I used headphones until the DAS was released.,Vive
"You mean like realistic, compound bow, tutorial type game?",Vive
"If youre buying new, you'd be lucky to even get a CPU/mobo combo that hits min spec. Recommended specs (i7 level) will cost you 250$+ just for the cpu",Vive

"with the knuckles you can setup different button configurations for each game you play, mess with the grip settings for the games you play and your hand will thank you after prolonged use, my suggestion is to switch the grip sense to a lower setting so that you dont have to grip your controller as if you were trying to pickup thors hammer",Vive
"Aside from both pcars games there’s IRacing and asetto  corsa.  I’m not sure if there’s a forza vr somewhere.

There’s dirt rally/2.0 (not sure if you need revive or not)

City car driving supports VR if you just wanna cruise a bit

American/European truck simulators for traffic simulation/joy riding


If you’re playing with a controller redshift is kinda like wipeout.

Otherwise it’s kind of a crap shoot on “try free/cheap/on sale” games",Vive
"Ram is good.  Motherboard isn't the best but will function fine.  Unless you are doing heavy multi-threaded workloads (which vr/gaming is for the majority not) I wouldn't upgrade the cpu from a 2600 to a 2700, the difference in gaming/vr will be almost non-existent.  If you are willing to spend a bit more, look into getting a ryzen 3600 instead of a 2600.  The performance gain will be much bigger than 2600-&gt;2700",Vive
I have the Vive headset. If anyone wants it cheap.,Vive
"if you are going to get one of these, given the price if you want some good double action practice it is great out of a 92, but for strikers and rifles you need to pull the slide/charging handle back each time which limits you practice to draw and fire (bullets have no rim so the extractor doesnt pull em out). Even with a 92 im limited to draw and fire because unless you are law enforcement lets be honest no one owns a double action only 92, and if you want to buy enough to fill a revolver (in my case a 627) i gotta buy 8 seperate 357 laser rounds or if you only buy 1 you have to reset the cylinder each time you shoot and the cheapest bullet that lasts is around 12$ each being around 100$ i got myself a used laser trainer that has simulated blowback instead for around 150, but this was a little while back and im guessing the bullet can be found cheaper.

Overall tho i would suggest laser training 100% because the dry fire practice with your actual gun, but if you want better dry fire practice and got an empty room, get an airsoft gun and setup some netting and steel plates and the ring you hear from hitting the target is too satisfying, while the laser training is more akin to indoor range training where you shoot your shots then walk up and check your phone to see your score.

edit- got my pricing messed up because i just bought a bunch of shit for cyber ""monday?"" (its sunday) the laser bullets are a bit pricier and if you are lucky can find them at a gunshow for around 30$ used but some shops will sell them for 50-60$ low end, and the better ones are closer to 100$ each, i also suggest if you are planing to use this for teaching or for a lot of use to get the ones with striker caps since they work through the striker hitting a foam pad instead of a plastic button. Again this plays into would you rather just buy a 22lr kit for 150$? or a laser trainer for 200 new that features blowback",Vive
"No offence but you need to read into computer hardware a little bit more.  When you say i7 that could mean a lot of different things. the i7 it could be the 9700k, a very fast modern cpu or an i7-920 which is an 11 year old crapo cpu.  Or even one of those garbage dual core i7s they put in laptops 8 years ago.  More than that, the [recommended cpu](https://www.vive.com/ca/support/vive/category_howto/what-are-the-system-requirements.html) for the vive is an i5-4590 not an i7.  You can buy an equivalent cpu (actually way better in multicore) in the form of a ryzen 1600 for $80 that it gets down to quite often.  I used the 1600 for vr for about a year and a half before I got my 3900x and it worked great.",Vive

I said i7 level assuming the reader wasnt talking about 11 year old parts. Sorry you need everything spelled out for you. 

The recommended specs for the Vive might be a 4590, but most games coming out now (AW, Stormlands, Boneworks, HLA, etc) recommend having something stronger than that. I personally had a 4690k and upgrading it made a massive difference, and I would definitely recommend either a new i5 or i7 CPU if you want to run new games on decent settings and have something for the future.",Vive

Does that have some DirectVR or whatever they call it for that title? Otherwise VorpX is kind of useless for Generations as that has native SBS 3D support built-in already.,Vive
"sounds good man, enjoy",Vive
Yes. Mine arrived last Wednesday. I ordered it not a week before that. It’s an amazing purchase. I could not tell you a difference between pre-owned and new. Besides the no headphones and wall mount.  It’s still one hell of a good deal though.,Vive
It highly depends on a game. Eleven Tennis and Beat Saber plays at 144. The more demanding titles don't.,Vive
"If you can't afford an Index now I suspect that by the time you can a new headset may be on the market by some other player, so getting the old vive just for the base stations would be pointless. Plus you're having to live with a now inferior headset just for the sake of having base stations on hand for the future.",Vive
"Thinking about that SureStrike one
:)",Vive
"With the index, and new Rift-s and quest hitting the market the old HTC Vive's are going to be hitting the market en mass so I'd wait. If you're set on a Vive they're likely to drop in price after christmas.  Although its smarter to get a NEW rift-s than an old vive as its a better headset.  Getting an old vive just so you can have base stations on hand for an upgrade means living with a poorer VR experience for the sake of some possible future upgrade.

"Worse black levels, more washed out colors and less brightness ... For me it was back and forth for a week but in the end I've decided that the clarity wins. I got too fixed on how Skyrim looked in comparison (dark levels like caves look quite horrible). But then I've switched to playing other games as well and it helped me to make a decision towards Index.
Also I disliked the Index controllers in the very beginning. They also require some getting use to. For me it was not an immediate love at first sight. They still seem a bit off but joysticks and finger tracking are worth it IMHO.",Vive

"Real life archer and VR enthusiast here. Most bows in VR does a great job of emulating the sensation of doing archery. However, archery skills in VR does not transfer into real life skills. At Least not with normal VR-controllers. Real life archery is a physical activity that requires strength and body control, and you have to practise with a real bow in order to achieve that. But it shouldn't stop you from having fun in VR. 

Here’s some games I like that feature archery: 

* Skyrim VR - remember to enable realistic archery.
* Island 359 - hunt dinosaurs with bow and arrows.
* Dead Effect 2 VR - has a compound bow.

Pavlov mostly. That game has fucking staying power. I don't normally enjoy multiplayer shooters, so it really took me by surprise how much it gripped me.",Vive
Sync cable only fixes tracking if the base stations can't see each other - if this happens Steam actually notifies you with a little pop up message that sits above the SteamVR panel until you acknowledge it. If you haven't seen this message it's unlikely your tracking issues are due to sync. More likely base station b is angled in such a way that you're losing line of sight to the headset and/or controllers at some points.,Vive
"Ebay always tries to keep the buyer happy. Contact the seller, ask for a return. If they refuse, contact ebay and say that it's unusable. Ebay will let you return it.",Vive
It's worth the money.,Vive
"Not even close. It's just a repetitive dungeon crawler with crappy and boring combat mechanic and insultingly trivial puzzles. There's almost no story, no open world. It's definitely the most overhyped VR game that I know of.",Vive
"Unless excessively intense (IE IR lasers) IR is as harmless as the light from a lightbulb, and even if it is too intense you'd find out quickly because the problem it causes is burning out your eyes. Bluetooth is harmless too based on the best evidence currently available, and even if it does turn out to be slightly harmful in some hypothetical future research it's so low power that it's going to cause far fewer issues than likely even your neighbours' WiFi (which uses exactly the same type of electromagnetic radiation, IE radio waves).",Vive
Who'd you recommend someone go to? I'm currently wanting to get the Trackers for full body tracking.,Vive
"It allows you to space out your upgrades and still get an experience in the first place. $350 buy-in with the option to upgrade each individual component. I can spend $350 and it allows me to play in vr and get an idea of what it is and decide if/what I want to upgrade. Yes, it may be more expensive in the long run, but it allows someone to experience it much sooner and go experience some of the weaknesses of the lower-end units, which they can then convey to other people trying to form their own opinions. In my situation, a $350 kit was affordable, and it leaves me room to upgrade the controllers and HMD. Probably sometime near tax time. Considering the vive cosmos just came out recently, and so did the rift S, it's unlikely that a headset will be released at a competitive price point that makes the vive pro or index bad purchases",Vive
Same.   I had to post negative remarks on social media to get HTC to solve my issues more promptly.,Vive
Agreed,Vive
"anything shiny, or that reflect light (like a mirror or some shiny metal, even the glass on a photo frame, windows...) can cause problem with tracking. so if you experience an issue, your first step should be to make sure there aren't any reflection messing with your tracking",Vive
Pavlov is an excellent game. No doubt about it.,Vive
"The index isn't available in Australia.

Also, it's not the best value headset but the Vive Pro Eye is the only headset on the market sold with either wireless or eye tracking (unless Pimax have already released their eye tracking).

There are definitely other things to consider of course but it's a decent deal if you were after that sweet sweet wireless.",Vive

**Espire 1: VR Operative Review**

*Final Verdict*

&gt;Espire 1: VR Operative is unquestionably the best expression of the stealth action genre we’ve seen in VR yet. The small touches of polish go a long way towards selling the immersion and opening your mind to the creativity on display to complete missions and the inventive VR-focused mechanics make it a pleasure to play actively in a roomscale space. While a larger budget, more time, and overall more resources could have elevated Espire 1: VR Operative to the status of being a landmark VR game that pushes the boundaries and redefines the genre even further, it’s still extremely good and certainly worth playing.",Vive

"I already own it. But you said we can’t build in space, I’m cool with that. But did you mean can make a ship from scratch or can’t? Because I am fine with a highly modular ship.",Vive

Approximately how expensive are the base stations? I don’t plan on going over 1000$,Vive
"Base stations go for about $110 each on ebay. I would say definitely go with the cosmos +base stations if your budget allows it because of the better overall visuals on the hmd and improved controllers.

Getting the vive is also better for data privacy.,Vive
"I've been experiencing the same issue now for the past 10 hours, was playing it just fine. Set it down to charge the controllers, went to play again then got the error. Sound plays no video. OR I see stuff, but no Audio.",Vive
"Call me naive, but I have little doubt that the Viveport software mines your data about as much as Oculus software does (not much). That said, I don't know about SteamVR's data collection policies.",Vive
One reason....thumbsticks...most of us have been playing video games our whole lives and a lot of things have changed...but the controllers have always have thumbsticks.  Vive releases controllers with trackpads and people wonder why people don't like them....this is the reason.  Trackpads suck.,Vive
Viveport is terrible for other reasons. But nobody beats Facebook on unethical data mining.,Vive
Combination of Alyx and Index now being available in Canada and Japan.,Vive
"Don't touch the cosmos or you will regret it for sure!

I've had one and I have returned it... Really bad for the price and the tracking is really poor.... Not even sure if it is fixable at this point.",Vive
Yeah kindof. But that has a very fake and cartoony feel to me personally. I want a more serious game rather than steampunk. Although it cant all revolve around my opinion but it would be nice to have.,Vive
it's fixable you just need the tracking faceplate.,Vive
At which point you might as well just buy the Index...,Vive
"I'm interested in the Cosmos because it's 
1. lighter weight
2. higher res
3. flip up front.

I have a Vive Pro but one of the main reason I don't play much VR is I don't like the feeling of being trapped in there.  So the flip up front might help.

The ideal Cosmos setup would be wireless.  Then you have a light weight flip up front wireless headset which would be very sweet.  It's expensive though.  Especially if you want lighthouse tracking.",Vive
basically anything is better than the OG Vive in terms of fatigue.,Vive
yeah the Cosmos is expensive but if I'm paying upwards $1000 it needs to be wireless.,Vive
"Fair enough. If wireless is a must, then it's almost the only reasonable use case for the cosmos.",Vive
"I am curious how long it takes you to fatigue on the OG Vive... at least I am assuming you do by the nature of your query.

&amp;#x200B;

I got to admit I have yet to experience the VR fatigue I have so often read about long before buying in and my months after.  Typically, sessions run just as long as the batteries last on either my controllers (Vive Wands or Index Controllers depending on the game) or my 22 amp-hour battery for the Vive Wireless; effectively no less than 3.5 hours straight.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother and his daughters all frequently go for at least a couple of hours straight when they come over to play.  Both of my setups are Vive Pro wireless.  I mainly went wireless because Elite: Dangerous with a wired headset really, really sucks to me where standing and room scale are acceptable to me with a headset wire.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure where and by how much the Vive Pro and the OG differ in feel.  I never did more than about 30 minutes on the OG Vive in any session.  My friend's Dell Visor setup never is particularly problematic to me, either.  I am quite curious to see the responses",Vive
"seated games are another use case since Cosmos has a higher resolution than the index.
It's lighter too and has a flip up front.",Vive
"Does the DAS make a difference?  How much does the OG in either config differ from the Vive Pro?  I am asking out of curiosity because I am quite comfortable for hours on end with the Vive Pro and if I had less self discipline for game time, I'd just buy another battery for the headset and pair in the controllers for my other set to extended sessions.",Vive
"It has higher angular resolution, but less FOV, which a lot of sim'ers are looking for. Also if you're just seeking PPD might as well go HP reverb. With regards to comfort and flip-up design, I've heard some pretty bad things from reviews, but understand that individual preference can impact ergonomics a lot, so might be great for you.",Vive
"make a mod where you dont use your legs,
and your skin is sitting in a swivel chair",Vive
"Come on, a pewdiepie reference?

:/",Vive
"You may only be able to get it on ebay now, but apparently you can reformat the dongle that comes with the steam controller to act as a tracker.

Much cheaper than the actual trackers!",Vive
Rift S,Vive
Only worth investing in if you plan on getting a wireless addon along with the tracking faceplate.,Vive
I just use a tissue... not the best thing to use but it works. Proper cloths would be best.,Vive
"From what I understand the loer For on the cosmos makes the higher resolution look even sharper. 
If I got one I'd be using it for seated games like Vorpx where Fov doesn't really make a difference.  Yeah there's the HP reverb but it's got it's own issues.  I'm definitely interested in it though.",Vive
"Pretty common I feel, only recently got into VR gaming myself about a week ago. Day 1 was horrible, used locomotive movement for games such as Arizona Sunshine and only lasted about 15 minutes with a splitting headache and fatigue.

Learned the hard way about easing into it slowly by using the teleport option and having a break every 30 minutes. Now it's gotten to the point where I can play for about 2 hours without feeling sick, but still get fatigued.",Vive
I got a little bit when first paying Elite Dangerous but got over it pretty quick. I can play Jet Island with no problems at all.,Vive
These are the display issue codes right? Is the light on your vive orange or green? I had the same issue when i got mine. Is it on a laptop or desktop? Does the display in the hmd turn on at all?,Vive
"Not gonna be that guy but I play my Og Vive wireless for 12 hours without any problems it’s really comfy, if I understand the question you asked correct",Vive
"It sounds like you are describing IL2 Battle of Stalin grad there chied. A realistic, amazing in VR, Plane and now tank simulator that supports as many people in an aircraft as there are positions for those people. Also DCS exists too, but it’s modern day for the most part.",Vive
"you cant make it from scratch

you can only upgrade your ship (stats wise, or inventory size), but you still need to go out in the wild and hunt for rare  ships if you want something new

but  seeing how ship customization has been requested for quite a while  now , i wouldnt doubt its on their list to add",Vive
No god please just get the rift s,Vive
"If you can afford it, the Valve Index is commonly regarded as the best. Otherwise the Oculus Rift S and Quest are good affordable options with convenient inside-out tracking.",Vive
Oculus' inside-out tracking implementation is 95% as good as the other options these days (after the software updates) and is much more convenient.,Vive
are you sure this is the right guide? I'm admittedly not great at fixing things. I have a buddy I'm going to talk to who is though.,Vive
"So far they haven't even bothered to email me back, but with it being black friday I probably could have picked a better day. I bought it on debit back when they came out.",Vive
I ordered in Canada pretty much the instant it was available. Hasn’t shipped yet. But i ordered the new lighthouses separately so I can flip my old Vive setup. Got lighthouses but not the new hmd or controllers yet.  One I got the shipping notification it took about 4 days.,Vive
Very much so imo. I went from og vive to index a few months ago and i cant be happier,Vive
Yeah but you dont get the full tracking and multiplayer in the same plane thing. It is a glorified war thunder lol.,Vive
"Im still thinking of getting the knuckles only because of finger tracking and boneworks/alyx is developed with them.
The price tag on the index is really hurting but one day maybe :)",Vive
"Save for full index kit 100%. I've had both and the vive just dosent do vr justice compared to the index. If you're patient enough to bet on being happier in the long run, get the index. 

I'm a nightshift nurse and theres really no night life where I live so I have spent quite a bit of time with both, the comfort and improved visuals are just fantastic on the index side.",Vive
I have a og Vive with the DAS and a battery strapped to the back for wireless. It’s incredibly comfortable. I often play for about and hour or more with zero fatigue from the headset itself.,Vive
"what?

I don't watch PewDiePie",Vive
New base stations also provide higher resolution tracking afaik. But I really needed them so I can sell my Vive to someone who wants to play Alyx.,Vive
"Ah ok didnt know that.

Was actually thinking to sell my vive too and just get the index full pack but still to much to bear atm :/
Anyway alyx is coming! :D",Vive
"It's not *definitely* not fixable, unless you mean from a consumer standpoint right now i.e. 'I can't fix it by buying a wireless kit' in which case, yeah that's true.

[They're working on it though!](https://uploadvr.com/valve-looking-into-wireless-index/)",Vive
"reminds me of Guns Of Icarus, but in wartime. would love to see this become a reality... a VIRTUAL REALITY (haha funny joke)",Vive
Lol,Vive
i dont see how nms is related?,Vive
I literally just bought the cosmos during black friday and there was 2 software updates out of box. I played it for 5 hours now and I dont have any tracking issues unless I have no lights on in the room other than that I'm certainly pleased with my purchase.,Vive
"I like mine pretty well. Never had any reliability problems. They work well as guns swords or paint brushes. I don't like trackpads, but the implementation here is fine. The were the best vr controller when they were released. I plan to get index controllers, but I don't think these are worthy of hate.",Vive
War dust.  You can already do that.,Vive
"Looks pretty good. I'll have to try it out, doesnt look like it had what I was asking but still looks really good. It is weird I havent heard of it by now.",Vive
Same - can go 3-4 hours easy. VR is a fitness challenge for some people. Hey it’s good exercise talk about killing two birds ....,Vive
God tier setup is vive pro/ knuckles / wireless adapter /2080ti / gear be lenses,Vive
"I suggest for a good price and quality get the htc vive. I had it for 4 years and it's amazing and I highly suggest it. If you can afford it get the index, I have that currently now and it works amazingly.",Vive
"I'm perfectly fine with them... when they don't break, that is. The trackpads are notorious for breaking down.",Vive
"Any liquid? Dry rub hasnt been enough for me. I have a few thick smudges clearly viable from afar, most likely from makeup. A liquid will be needed for sure.",Vive
"Personally my opinion, owning both and haveing alot of hours in. I say the OG vive is easier on the eyes. Simply because it's not as close and not as bright in my opinion. So I get annoyed a little faster, as well as a little discomfort with the headband and stuff. Although I have a large head so it just is annoying lol. Never had problems with the OG vive tho so idk. But tbh theres not much. If you have everything fitting right you should be fine and go the same time. That's what I have felt atleast.",Vive
"OG vive are plenty good, so is the rift S and quest",Vive
"I haven't checked up on vive version but there use to be [https://youtu.be/l56c0W8STEI?t=1](https://youtu.be/l56c0W8STEI?t=1)  dunno what has become of it

"Half life 2 has native VR support with no motion controls. Just opt-in to the beta branch in Steam and turn off direct mode in Steam VR. Then when your game start, go to video options and enable ""virtual reality mode"".",Vive
"It was a solid red, I have fixed it though. 

I did the power through the link box, and the other cables directly into my computer. I had tried this before, but I did a clean install of steamVR, and retried it. It worked for some reason this time.",Vive
"Yes that was going to be my first suggestion. If it still is giving you problems, i would recommend buying an HDMI repeater. The link box acts as one but sometimes its just fucked up out of the box and some PCs HDMI ports do not have enough power to support an HMD, especially if you are on a laptop.",Vive

Half-Life 2 can be played in VR using the [VRMod addon](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1678408548). It's pretty freaking great, but keep in mind that both games weren't designed for VR in the first place.

My two cents: Microsoft is preparing WMR 2.0 and all those deals on those headsets are clearance sales. That or MS is abandoning WMR wich I find very unlikely.,Vive
"they've been on clearance for a while then.

I think oculus is ripping people off and so is vive, pimax etc.

If a lenovo explorer is $99 headset only, and ody+ is $230 with controllers, and ody+ has the same screen as the vive pro, then we should be seeing PCVR with lighthouse tech for $300-$350 (using v 1.0 lighthouses)",Vive
Still too much,Vive
The other companies shaft you. Rift s is wmr with more.cameras and and a shittier screen.,Vive
but once you get Vorpx you can buy a bunch of flat games that are cheap instead of $20 VR games so in the end you end up saving money.,Vive
That is shit tho.  With Vorpx it's actually halfway decent.,Vive

Odyssey has 3 less cameras, a better screen by a moderate amount and was derived almost entirely from previous windows HMDs. Rift s launched at $400 is using its own software and hardware developed specifically for the rift and has more cameras for better tracking.

You're comparing an xbox 360 to a gaming pc and asking why the PC is overpriced. Yes vr is expensive right now but you're paying for the research and development, software and the luxury of being first. The OG vive is already only $350 and in a few years you'll see the index for $500 or less too.",Vive

BTW, Oculus ceased as a company over a year ago - there's now only Facebook Technologies Ltd.(see bottom of www.oculus.com).
 
 
Yes, there is a lot of overpricing going on.  Probably because of the small market size being more enthusiast led(and thus, likely considered more willing to pay high pricing).
 
 
To be honest, I think Valve intentionally want to raise the desire of VR, by psychology, because even cheaper VR isn't drawing people in.  People can't see how impressive 6DOF VR is without trying it, but they can see a high price tag and think: ""Wow, they must think that is really desirable!"" and thus, they then look at VR more seriously and either buy another cheaper VR system or work towards the higher priced one they now desire.",Vive

Witch doesn't make sense because it's make it a more expensive hmd than the index with nothing better to justify its price point...,Vive
it's optional though which is good.  I would imagine there are a ton of games that are perfectly fine without it.,Vive
"Not sure if tracking is fixable... They used rgb camera which no one of the other hmd manufacturer used to track controller...

They have made several updates to the tracking which I can only qualify as marginal amelioration.

I'm not comfortable recommending a vr hmd to someone that 'will probably be fix sometime in the futur' which is a bold statement because nobody know that.

The only fact you can rely on is that right now the cosmos have the worst tracking of all the hmd for a  very high price point.  Even wmr hmd at 200$ have better tracking.",Vive

"Unless you have different mat where you live 5 in 18 months is several per year as far as I can tell. They only post about major ones though. You usually get smaller ones in between. Sorry that you had such a bad experience with your refund. For me that's still no reason to the shit you posted above.

I and many, many more are very happy with there purchases, and especially with the continued support the app gets for years. Which you obviously can't know anything about.",Vive
I was going to go with the cosmos because the room I’d be using it in would be brightly lit but people have still said negative things about the tracking.,Vive
I assume so.,Vive
okay. i guess the worst thing that could happen is the quality is shitty and i return it.,Vive
"Sure, some people are fine with it....I'm just stating the entire world has and is mostly using thumbsticks to game with controllers.  Even HTC is moving away from trackpads and going to thumb, i.e. vive cosmos.",Vive
"You definitely do get multiplayer in the same plane, you also get multiplayer in the same tank. By tracking do you mean like VR or TrackIR, because you do get full VR tracking.",Vive
"It's not hateful shit it's a fact, it's what I experienced and as you can see anyone advocating Voprx will get downvoted because I'm not alone in my experience.",Vive
Are we talking about the Vive or the Vive pro?,Vive
"The Index controllers will work with V1 and V2 basestations, so we are talking about both.",Vive
"See I was originally going to get the index but since I live in Canada, it costs 1300$",Vive
"Oh. Fantastic news, thank you!",Vive
really but /u/jfwatier says that it's barely usable.,Vive
Is that your first hmd?,Vive
Just look up the review on YouTube post on reddit etc... You will see in not the only one...,Vive
"for the steam sale I see people paying $16 for Moss.  Wow what a steal!  

Meanwhile,  I'll be getting MGS5 Phantom Pain and Ground Zeroes for $11.",Vive
I would also like some vr for black mesa!,Vive
technically speaking it's certainly superior but functionally speaking it's hardly noticeable in my experience. But if you're truly looking for superior tracking you don't buy a rift S you buy something with exterior basestation trackers.,Vive
The Rifts can play almost all of them. LA Noire doesn't/didn't work. That's about it. Some games like Fallout 4 didn't put any effort into Touch controls.,Vive
i have to concede this point. however custom grips sort this on wmr,Vive
"It's not just the ergonomics, it's also the tracking.",Vive
What do you mean by Certified?,Vive
"How does the Rift S handle controllers close to the face? As in, aiming down pistol sights with the controller literally touching the headset.",Vive
"Checking the boxes can see each other properly, and making sure mirrors/highly reflective surfaces are covered up are about the only diagnostic things you can do.",Vive
"Well shit, is that all because I always do that",Vive
"The boxes are 'dumb' they just throw out lasers in all directions, so there really isn't much that can go wrong in that sense.

  
There is the possibly they have a fault, but it's not something I'd recommend taking them apart and digging around for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly there's nothing else you can try, just consider anything that might have changed in the mean time.",Vive
lmao I didn't know about that,Vive
"Sure do.  Step 1 is following this guide, which turns your vive wands into generic vive trackers.  Note that there is a typo in step 5.  “generic-tracker”, should read, ""generic_tracker""

Then you need to convert your steam controller dongles into vive watchman dongles.  To do this, you can use the program Natural Locomotion which has an easy function to convert them.  There is a manual way to do it, but I don't know that one.",Vive
That's what she said,Vive
The difference in tracking is functionally very difficult to notice.,Vive
I was around during the Oculus DK1 era and spent entire afternoons playing through Half-Life 2 in VR. It pretty much vaccinated me against motion sickness. I definitely see why it would make anyone else sick though haha,Vive
have you used a quest /rift s lately??? The tracking is great. it basically never breaks down for me.,Vive
Same. I disable my other audio device first,Vive
"I also did this and added a 2nd layer of foam padding with double sided tape.  The weight of the battery on the back of the DAS is almost a perfect counter weight for the display.

I can play non stop until the batteries die.",Vive
Same :D,Vive
+1,Vive
"The odyssey+ is a fine headset and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone that didn't want to spend more money on better gear. In Vr like virtually every other niche hobby, price to performance doesn't scale, if you want a 10% better experience it will cost you 30% more money. No one is forcing anyone to by any of the more expensive setups, it's just that the buyers think they are worth the money.",Vive
"What the hell is vivecraft?

If you’re looking for a cheap VR headset, it’s Black Friday/cyber Monday right NOW.

Get a cheap WMR, or a used OG vive.  Neither should cost more than a couple hundred bucks.

Using a google cardboard, wii controllers, a mouse, and potentially trying to mod your game to allowed for preferred rotation sounds like a lot of work.  If you can’t get your hands on an HMD just play 2d and wait for the next sale (Boxing Day, I’d expect)",Vive

I can't seem to figure this out. If I'm not mistaken, you can run up to 3 Vives using 3 Vive wireless units on one PC. So my question is can I use one Vive with a wireless unit and one wired through the linkbox through one PC?

Its a VR mod for minecraft, it actually works lmfao.

I could get WMR but definitely not an OG vive, those are still expensive.

I am always up for a challenge, by the way. I know its just easier to take an easy route and just-buy-a-headset-you-idiot, but I am in ENGLAND, home of tea and strange prices.

Windows Mixed Reality headsets look quite cheap, but how do they work? I see alot of confusing brand headsets like Lenovo and Acer, are they computer specific? I don't even have an Acer, Lenovo or any of those types of PC's.",Vive
I have seen used tested working vive wands for $49 on eBay.  Probably cheapest route if you don't want to fix yourself.,Vive
"Hardly. He’s right, Vorpx works really well in the vast majority of cases if you just set everything up right. I’ve been using it for a couple of months now.",Vive
"Oh mine craft...eww.

It’s not a “hey wouldn’t this be easier” it’s about playing the game you want.  Ad-hoc jerry-rigging a VR instance is going to give you a sub par experience.  It’s vr for the sake of vr, instead of vr for the sake of fun.

All the WMR headsets are identically specced, except for the odyssey (amoled screens I think), at 1440p.  WMR is like a standard for brands to meet, all that really changes is the headband/face gasket.

You don’t need a matched computer, just a free HDMI and usb3.  Download the drivers and off you go.  They work with steam through WMR portal.

I have a Samsung odyssey+ for my racing games, and I don’t own Samsung anything else in my life, it works fine.

I just checked amazon, the HP kit IS 210usd.  I’m sure there’s stuff on eBay too.  If you can’t afford that, just hold up on VR until the next sale.  Wait for a quality experience, it’s worth it.",Vive
Right? I don’t even understand it. It’s like some stupid cult or something. The Vorpx team has done a pretty good job considering nobody else is even attempting a similar project.,Vive
Depends if you still got your vr legs,Vive
Does it? They'll come back soon enough if I don't,Vive

Ah. Think this was out longer than 8 months. Pretty sure I've got this,Vive
"Seriously doubt it buddy, they have to be angled down to catch your movement, not much down from that, highest you can go with sensors is about 6’6 with the shape of it so that leaves zilch for you, really think it will struggle to track your movements",Vive
"WMR flopped hard. it had some good elements, especially the o+, but ultimately it's cheap because they're dumping stock. they'd definitely rather still be selling it at $499.",Vive
Useful. Thanks. I've been away from vr for 8 months so need to try and decide what must haves I've missed. This will help.,Vive

I thibk they just added upgrades. I’ll probably wait a bit and seeing if they do actual customization,Vive
Is that team different from the HL2VR project as we know it? You're being kinda vague except for that part that it's surely worked on. Further links or references would help.,Vive

"All the WMR track inside out, so as long as you have the the space they should be good (only wired though, no wireless options).

The negative on WMR (compared to say, a vive) is reduced controller tracking in you periphery (or no tracking behind you).  On the up side it means no lamps or cameras to mount.

If you run out of tether, you can always get HDMI and USB 3.0 extensions, but there isn’t a wireless option.  Investigate active HDMI, or HDMI repeater couplers if you go this road (to stop signal degradation).

I’d say it’s an excellent intro to VR, and it has full seated/roomscale functionality.

After minecraft you’ll have the freedom to boot up space pirates, beat Sabre, and pistol whip.
Or Pavlov :)

There are great cases for the other entry level HMDs, but this is by far the cheapest route (and proper 90hz refresh, unlike the quest)",Vive
"I like where your solution is heading, if you want to increase the number of spells you can cast or have it so you can cast something more powerful maybe implement a mechanic that allows you to ""trace a shape"" after picking a quadrant.",Vive

"Thanks! I have it setup currently so if you grab and instantly release a particular spell, the other variant of the spell will be available. This could allow for access of up to 8 attacks at a time. 

I like the idea of having ultimate spells available after certain actions such as tracing a shape. I want to keep the system fast-paced but if you space out the tracing actions, I could see it being a cool mechanic.",Vive
"Dang, yeah I still haven’t found a fix. I’m taking it over to a friends to run on his computer to try to rule out of its my PC or if it’s something with the vive. Super frustrating.",Vive
"Sounds interesting, but I am not sure if Vivecraft will allow Standing Up mode with WMR.",Vive
"If it supports roomscale then it shouldn’t be a problem.

Really, even if you play seated there’s nothing stopping you getting up and walking around.",Vive
Probably dumping stock because they have a new headset on the way.,Vive

"My setup is in a room with 7"" ceiling and works just fine. Like others have said you might need to use the sync cable if tracking goes out frequently.",Vive
"yeah i haven't used WMR since i sold my odyssey in January of this year, if there has been a milestone improvement in tracking since, i could be wrong.",Vive
funny enough i just posted this the other day: https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/e3gwmy/quest_tracking_the_mirror_test/,Vive
"I have a Quest and am aware of it's limitations. If you are outside the tracked volume for more than a couple seconds it doesn't know the position anymore.

It happens often. Just most of the time you're not aware as long as it doesn't affect gameplay. For the vast majority of games it doesn't matter but it does happen. I'd say a game like VR Chat is where it comes into play most. It doesn't affect gameplay but other see how it messes up your avatar when things just teleport around.",Vive
"Oh no, it had nothing to do with VorpX, Half-Life 2 had native VR support during the early Oculus era. It was just super motion sickness-y because the controls were the same — and sitting on a chair with the headset on, being in Gordon's POV while he runs around at a ridiculously unrealistic speed made me really sick.",Vive
have you stood in front of the mirror to watch in real time?,Vive
"You are right with the whole tracking and that. But really, what is ""An Intro to VR"" ?

I get that doing VR for the sake of VR is your point, but why not do VR for the sake of fun instead? VR Headsets can get expensive, and theres always a debate. Oculus Quest looks good, sounds cheap within the price, the Windows Mixed Reality also looks good. But you have to realise something

You need a good computer for most headsets, so if your PC is shit, just get an Oculus Quest, right? But what if your PC is good, or atleast, mid-range bare minimum. Well, you could just use an Oculus Rift, Vive and other expensive headsets, or  you could just use a phone with a gyroscope and some cheap cardboard and glass lens's to get a cheap first look and experience into VR. It may not be FULL VR, it might just be fun knowing that you can look around you and look at your minecraft builds as if they were real, as if you are there.

I probably would get a WMR headset if it had SteamVR compatible controllers that are compatible with Vivecraft that allow me to use standing up mode to hit trees with the controllers and not a button press. And if it is compatible with my pc.

If I am unable to get a WMR, maybe I will do some experimenting like an evil scientist and emulate VR controllers and start making minecraft mods that manipulate how the cursor crosshair works aswell as some HUD mods that make the hud more pleasant, like a transparent hud that becomes opaque at a certain event, and then maybe emulate some headset tracking aswell.

Sorry if I sound rude btw, but I like your key points, Windows Mixed Reality does seem cheap, I found a headset and controllers for about £200 but also, heres a question for you. What about Leap Motion Orion?",Vive
With the editor tools / or at least the alyx mod tools theres gonna be so much content and remakes,Vive
"Yes, but I tend not to because Rec Room's performance tanks horribly in front of that mirror. Also, when actively looking at yourself you behave differently. Your movement in front of the mirror won't match your natural movements.

A specific example... When playing Shadow Point I'll often have my hands just down at my sides as I try and figure out a puzzle. Take a few steps forward and turn around and see floating controllers directly in front of me. They respond/rotate but they don't move. Eventually they'll teleport out of existence when hands get back into the tracked volume.

The first couple times it happened I didn't realize it was my own hands and was like WTF are those things. 

Rec Room probably has slightly more intelligence in how it handles tracking loss and just makes better assumptions. However, it doesn't actually know what is going on when outside tracked volume.",Vive
"I just finished HL2 VR in VorpX last night and it was amazing.  The program costs money but it’s well worth it.  What makes it special is the geometry 3D mode, FOV adjustments and directVR which make games like HL2 and Bioshock feel like native VR.  And it didn’t make me motion sick due to control settings that are implemented by the app.  Which I can’t say for HL2’s native VR mode.

Get VorpX",Vive
Im 6’2 as well and slam my hands into a light above me all the time. You just learn to subconsciously avoid it after a while lol,Vive
"maybe you should listen to other people as actually go try what i described in that post, rather than make assumptions. 

jesus,  redditors are so frustrating sometimes it's like talking to a brick wall who think it is god himself.",Vive
Light is radiation. You'll need to be more specific.,Vive
" [https://uploadvr.com/windows-vr-expectations/](https://uploadvr.com/windows-vr-expectations/) 

This plus the recent statement regarding VR on XBox...doesn't seem like WMR2.0 is anywhere near.",Vive
And controllers too. The Cosmos controllers are not compatible with basestation tracking. And now you've spent more money than an Index.,Vive
"IMHO, VR is kind of an evolving hobby more than just “a new screen to play games on”. I’m into sim racing/flying, so VR means building tactile controllers for everything (I can’t use a keyboard reliably with a headset on), so maybe that’s just my bias... however the VR space is evolving, and products are shifting frequently.
It won’t take long to want a longer cord, roof mount cord management, squishier facefoams, etc.  Never mind a racing wheel, different controllers, a gun (haha).  Heck I just bought a subpac as a poor mans haptic feedback vest.

So when I say “intro to VR” I mean a tracked headset, and controllers. With that, and maybe an ex box controller there aren’t many games you won’t be able to try/enjoy.  Odd are it will leave you longing for more kit, or a better headset down the road.  Index supports finger tracking, other HMDs track hands behind the back, etc.
However, the resolution is right up there with the other upper crust headsets, and it comes with controllers that work just fine for 95% of games.  That’s all WMR.


I agree that you should get this google cardboard thing going, it’ll just whet your appetite :)
My concern is makeshift controllers+hmd+3rd Party software+potential self mod= glitchy, frustrating gameplay, and a potential fan turned off VR.

If you’ve got any disposable income (don’t know if you’re 5, 15, or 50), I highly suggest a couple hundred bucks on a cheap headset (new WMR or used vive/oculus); especially since it’s rotating sales from today until about newyears. You’ll be playing your game in fifteen minutes with no glitches, and no headache.

On the strong computer....sort of.  How old is your rig? VR isn’t that ‘new’ anymore.
What do you have for a video card? Basically anything 1060 and up should be fine.  I was on a 1070 for several years and no issues (played most everything on hi on an OG vive).
Don’t worry about your CPU either, I think 5th gen i5 was the suggested...

If you need a new PC to run the HMD, I get it, bad investment, go with a quest. I think it’s a bit pricier than the WMR though.
If you have a PC DO NOT buy the quest.  This is just my opinion, but there was a huge movement to keep Screen refresh rate at 90hz or higher (like the index), or else motion sickness and choppiness; yet the quest is capped at 72hz, which (to me) is junk.

Not familiar with the leap motion Orion, but I remember shopping for a leap motion something-or-other before, it taped to the front of your HMD and did hand tracking.  I wanted it for clickable cockpits in FSX, but I wound up just building a button box with arduino.

Perfect example of what I meant as “intro to VR” though.  Even if you had a vive pro, within a month your like “can I get hand tracking for this? Is there some third party thing I could hack?”


Don’t worry, you aren’t being rude.  I’m suggesting dropping hundreds of dollars on a headset lol.

Amazon a cheap one.  Return it if you don’t like it :)",Vive
I recommend googling about ionising radiation and non-ionising radiation. I think it’s perfectly healthy to question these things but once you know the science behind how radiation causes the reactions needed to cause cancer your heart will be put to rest.,Vive
"even gestures, moving your arm rapidly from one side to the other, up and down; having fire rain down or ice and rock pierce through the ground",Vive
Why not experience them as they were designed?,Vive
"I don't think you read my post.

I've used the mirror but don't put much stock into it because Rec Room has additional logic to hide tracking loss.  Also, it's sickness inducing for me on Quest because of the massive frame drops. Also, watching yourself ""perform"" isn't a good test of natural movements you do while actually playing games.

I gave you a very specific example of how to test tracking loss in another game that doesn't attempt to hide it.

Quest tracking is quite impressive (especially impressed with it's low light abilities) and good for almost everything so far but it does have limitations. Pretending they don't exist does't really help anybody.",Vive
"itif you actually read my post, you would see that I've acknowledged that tracking is only maintained via motion, and that it becomes rotation only once they come to a stop (e.g. rested at your sides). so i don't know why, other than arrogance and failure to comprehend me, you would think i don't know that.

second, this started when you said 'if you could see your hands, you'd think differently'...and despite being able to point to a predated post where i discuss and test just that, you're unphased.

because you're an asshole. fuck off. blocked.",Vive
"Yeah, you're right. Thanks for the advice. Maybe I will start with Google Cardboard for now and maybe move onto WMR or the oculus quest some other time.

Right now, I am an experimenter, so I guess dipping my toes into the sea using the Google Cardboard VR to check if my PC can properly render VR at a somewhat ok framerate and quality would be the best step to take before getting out of the shallow end of the water.",Vive
"I could see a system where you pull the trigger than the spell follows your aim for the next 5 seconds. That would be pretty cool though balancing would definitely take some work.

Real-time effects such as piercing the ground are always amazing to see but are rather difficult from a performance perspective to implement (at least for me).",Vive

Your original post that started this conversation gave me the impression you didn't understand Quest tracking limitations. The phrasing ""for me"" specifically being what I felt was a poor argument.

I see we are on the same page now and we are simply describing those limitations differently. 

You saying it basically never breaks down because you don't notice it where I say it happens all the time and it's just not something, as a player, you notice often.

Im really not at liberty to say.,Vive
I will hold you to that!,Vive
Umm spend a grand on a gpu... VR is hard to max out anything similar to a 1080 will be good enough. By the time it's not you'll wanna upgrade to a different headset,Vive
"Yes, I have not had a problem with my over 30 vr games. And of there is a small problem, maybe you dont like the button layout there Is a menu option to change every button to do a specific thing in the game. So you have full control over the settings.",Vive
Last time I played( a year ago) they had none of this. I will have to take a look into it again. And I mean full tracking by controllers and headset.,Vive
"Depends on how much you can get it for. I got my headset, stations, controllers and all the cables for ~$230 from Facebook for the HTC Vive. After it broke, the horrible experience I had with support and them returning a headset with more damage then it originally had, I just can't recommend them.

For ~$300 I think the Vive is worth it but the biggest drawbacks is 

1. Failure is something that can happen and then you'll be out however much you spent. If it's under warranty I was quoted at $270 to replace a chip in the motherboard.

2. You're gonna get bored of it. Certain people will buy it for the novelty and then never pick it up again because it's just easier to play a PC game. VR is cool, but you're still ""exercising"", moving around just stops being fun after awhile.

3. It's a novelty and will be for a long time. VR for all it is is extremely fascinating and an experience I am thankful to have had before I die. That being said, it's still a novelty and really I just use it to show off. My friends will be blown away but then the next time they're over they want nothing to do with it. It's just hard to put into words but after a while it just stops being VR and becomes ""more complicated video game"".",Vive

"Well, my pc has lower than recommended specs for VR, but i can run pavlov on low settings 100% resolution, with the occasional stutter during intense parts, ive not tried boneworks though so i cant give an opinion on that, but beat saber runs on almost everything, if you do try them through steam remember you can get a refund if they dont work for you",Vive

"Its definitely not the same pavlov as 8 months ago, I noticed the same thing after my return. Its sorta the gmod of vr now.",Vive
Yes,Vive
"To be honest I don't think they care about the VR sales at the moment as they have been investing heavily on hololens, and perfecting the technology there. Using WMR to power VR on XBOX xeems like the most obvious approach right? But comparing it to the PSVR the take is that has way more resolution which I don't think the xbox can handle at the moment so the experience would be very incomplete. I think microsoft is playing very safe here and waiting for the market to mature. I'm pretty sure that the current implementation already works on the XBOX internally given how it's OS is so close to Windows 10.",Vive

As you can see, some games will go into reprojection (like *Subnautica*) on max settings even with a RTX 2080 Ti.  And if you really want to ""max out"" VR games even using an OG Vive, you can increase the pixel density (akin to SuperSampling which will improve the sharpness of the visuals and decrease the 'screen door' effect) and bring any video card to its knees.

For maxing out your VR experience, pick the fastest video card you can afford.  And don't neglect your CPU, although you won't need the fastest.",Vive

"This is probably a bad place to ask this question, because most hardcore VR players don't think fatigue is an issue. They'll play Nomanski or Asgard's Wrath or something for 5 hours straight, like it's no big deal.

However, I'm right there with you man... VR is fatiguing. No two ways about it. I just think the hardcore players have convinced themselves that it's not an issue and they just power through it.

When you wear a VR headset, there's a price you'll pay. A lot of it is refresh rate. 30 years from now, we might have headsets running at 800 frames a second in each eye, and then... maybe then... eye fatigue won't be a factor.",Vive

It’s like looking at cars and saying that one with more horsepower is better. Or more cargo space, or a cheaper price. Better to who?

So most laptops that have enough power to run VR will run hot. Take a look at reviews. Some laptops are better with thermals than others. Proper full size PCs can handle thermals much easier because they have much more space for heat sinks.",Vive

[OG Vive vs Vive Pro, which to get?](/r/Vive/comments/e45fd0/og_vive_vs_vive_pro_which_to_get/) by  AdorableMolasses


I'm unsure of which to get. I was originally going to get the OG vive, but since it's completely sold out on amazon/the htc site, I'd have to get it used from somewhere I couldn't return it if I needed to.

I've read a few poor things in reviews about the vive pro, such as the tracking is worse. Is this true, and either way, is Vive Pro worth it?

Every time, I have no issue running until the batteries are dead on the wireless adapter or both sets of controllers.  Perhaps being old help my (lack of) sensitivity.",Vive

"I have both and I wouldnt consider it personally, unless those pre-owned ones have decent warranty still.",Vive
I've not noticed any CPU load. Maybe if you have dual core?,Vive
If you monitor this properly you will see additional cpu load/temps.  If a game has good multithreading you may not notice as much of a drop in performance but you still will see some.  X Plane 11 is probably the worst right now because it does not do multithreading.  This should improve once they go to Vulkan sometimes next year.,Vive

Never homie. The OG vive is discontinued. HTC only wants people to spend the big $$$ on vive pro,Vive
I’ll just pull the $1400 out of my wallet and BAM. Vive.,Vive
"afaik It is out of production and they are selling off parts via certified pre-owned option.

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding at this point is the vive is partially discontinued at least in part due to part availability, as some of the components are no longer manufactured (the screen being the big one)

&amp;#x200B;

So what is going to happen?

&amp;#x200B;

HTC has a few steps forward.

&amp;#x200B;

The Vive Department only has a few cards to play, the pro, and the cosmos, and a new project.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on their situation There are only so many options.

&amp;#x200B;

They might be phasing out vive to release Vive 2, 2.0 tracking + increased resolution would be a minor increase in cost from OG vive and if they could hit the 500-700$ kit mark they would have a compelling product. This would also require relatively minimal tooling, and thus is a CHEAP option to implement.

&amp;#x200B;

They might try to prop up the cosmos. Both a major price cut or positioning it as better than the vive pro (and possibly vive pro decrease in cost) are both viable options that could yield benefits for minimal cost.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know enough about their costs and margins, so I expect more the latter option, but They are cash strapped so the move will be quick whatever it is..... It is also very important to note that they have been release-ing several VR products per year.... so it is a very viable option they have a vive 2 in the pipelines.....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless its a bit up in the air and I don't know enough about Their business culture to make an overly educated guess.",Vive
"Sorry, I do think my response was rather harsh.

I guess it very much depends on what your priorities are - while I don't know myself I've heard the exclusivity deals generally pay rather well, and that means more to me than more people being able to play my stuff.

I guess you just care much more about your ideals than I do about mine - of course that's a perfectly valid thing too, and I guess we can only really agree to disagree about this.

In any case, sorry about quite a few of my comments being rather harsh.",Vive
Alright. Thanks for the info. Do you think it would be worth it buy the refurbished one and use that one?,Vive
"personally based on the quality of support of HTC I would be more inclined to buy used directly from someone, some more risk, but should be able to get for 250-300$ (I don't know what ""warranty"" they are offering on the refurb ones)

The reality is I don't know right now, If you strictly want to play VR games I would look into the Rift S or Quest+Link.... if you want FBT for VRChat (more or less only use) or possibly want to upgrade to index within ~12months then the vive may be a better option.",Vive
Alright. Thanks for the input.,Vive
"Look at the Index. Essentially a Vive 2, without having to deal with HTC.",Vive
Yea I’ve seen the index. It’s pretty pricey I think though.,Vive
"its \~8% more performance.... so you can pretty much take your frame time and multiply by .925 to figure it out.

You might be better served by cleaning up background processes etc while playing, or possibly manually forcing certain processes to certain cores.",Vive
thanks :-),Vive
If you are new to vr I would highly recommend a 2nd hand og vive. Parts compatible with index hmd for layer upgrade,Vive
I’ll probably do that.,Vive
"&gt; unique summer field simulation program

What a fancy name for a 360 video",Vive
"In most things no. But Skyrim VR I really noticed it in the dark dungeons. However, another redditor pointed out that it makes them actually use torches and light sources more.  Doing that makes it much less of an issue. 

Bottom line, we don’t have a perfect HMD yet but the index is the best yet for comfort, FOV and most of the time really great visuals.   The more you use it the more you love it.",Vive
"I have both a Quest and a wireless Vive w/ the DAS. I will take the Vive any day of the week over the Quest.

The comfort of the Vive is night and day difference compared to the Quest. I can’t wear the Quest for more than 15 min without pain,  it I can go over an hour no problem. The cushion on the Quest feels like a brick compared to the Vive’s soft foam.

The only really complaint for the Vive is just the SDE is pretty bad if you want to play a game where need to see details. Mine is mostly just a beat saber machine, so it doesn’t bother me.

As for tracking, the Quest is good but games like Beat Saber just don’t feel the same as on the Vive. I can’t even complete the same difficulty on the Quest compared to the Vive. 

Just my 2 cents on the comparison. I would go with the certified Vive is you don’t ever plan to take VR anywhere.",Vive
No need for apologies. You're correct - it's about trade offs. I'm a solo indie dev so the benefits of exclusivity deals are somewhat irrelevant to me from an income perspective and I value the idea of being able to write software once that runs anywhere highly. The game most similar to mine also received Oculus funding. It was both improved and made sacrifices for that.,Vive
"I completely agree even preferring the Vive overall. In games like Skyrim VR, the touchpad is atrocious to use in game for movement.",Vive
"I moved from Vive to Rift S and wouldn't be able to go back. The screen clarity and lens improvements are significant. The Index is a great piece of hardware, but you can always sell the Rift S and buy an Index down the track when you have more disposable money.",Vive
Yeah I would never shop there lmao,Vive
k,Vive
"Playing on Quest is a joy. I have Rift S and Quest and while S has wonderful screen and gives you more presence, I honestly prefer playing same games on Quest if available on both systems.

Wireless is fantastic. But not just wireless. Strapping on hmd and be in vr in a matter of seconds, anywhere in the house (or... anywhere) is liberating and so convenient.

The only downside, as others have mentioned, is comfort.",Vive
"The comfort is subjective to each person I hated my vive with das compared to the Rift,  for me as far as comfort it goes; PSVR &gt; Index &gt; Quest &gt; Rift OC1 &gt; GO &gt; Vive with DAS. I could never wear the vive for longer than 45 min to an hour, but I have no issue with Quest , Index, and PSVR for hours . I just think for the money OP was taking about you get better visuals than both the vive and rift cv1 with the quest and the tracking for me has been perfect . If money isn’t a worry I will always say Index full kit,",Vive

Ohhhh shit we just became sentient,Vive
I recommend Vive pro. It has much better and more reliable tracking. SDE is worse but contrast and colors are better because of OLED display.,Vive
"Yes, when using the Link it's very heavily compressed. It's widely reported when doing an A/B test with Rift S vs Quest that the Quest is a bit soft when using Link.

That being said Carmack has tweeted that it should improve some over time as they fine tune the functionality. I personally haven't tried link with my Quest yet but I have used ALVR and it's pretty good image quality wise so I wouldn't worry about it being a night and day difference compared to a real PCVR headset.",Vive
"It really depends on what you’re playing.  
Some games cause motion sickness in almost everyone, some cause none.  
Some games have modes to help minimise it.  

You’ll see more people getting motion sickness when the game moves you without you physically moving. I imagine motion sickness is uncommon in games where your character movement correlates directly to your real-world movement.",Vive
"This really depends on how much you want to risk bricking your headset, you could very easily break something taking it apart, or when trying to put it back together. You could misalign a sensor and have a headset that doesn't track properly, along with countless other fails along the way.

Technically, yes it could be partially painted, but you'd have to be an expert electronics repair person to get it apart and back together.",Vive

"I got sim sick when I first bought my VR. Had the same thoughts about having made a mistake dropping so much money on something that would make me sick every time I played it. Even had to lay down for several hours after a particularly bad session.

However, it gets better. I now regularly sim race in VR, can play any game with no issues, never get sick.

I found I had to ease into it, build up my sim legs. Start with things that won't cause any problems (where your in game character doesn't move in space, like beat sabre, space pirate trainer, that sort of thing), initially use friendlier locomotion alternatives (eg. Teleportation), and respect your limits (if you start feeling sick, don't push on, just call it quits for a while - you'll get over it faster than if you push on and feel sicker).",Vive
Depends on the game. I had it pretty bad at first. Once you feel sick it can take an hour of lying until it gets better. Nowadays I’m fine,Vive
I haven't seen any verified statistics on this issue. I'd like to.,Vive
Just take it very slowly and stop immediately if you start to feel ill. You just have to train your brain to see that it is ok. Continuing on until you are horribly sick will make it worse and be counter-productive.,Vive
"I’ve had a vice for around 2 years and never once had anyone complain about motion sickness. My dad says he can, “Feel the g force” when doing a rollercoaster simulator but that’s about it",Vive
"The thing is, you notice pretty quick if you are about to get motion sick. It starts to feel *uncomfortable*. Just take of the headset and stop playing for a couple of minutes when the feeling arrives and you should get no long lasting motion sickness. Also, maybe in the beginning, take a rest every 10 minutes and check how you are feeling. You will notice if something feels off. Most games try to limit the motion sickness inducing mechanics so you should be fine.  


Have fun playing! It's really something else :)",Vive
"A lot of games are made with  vive controllers in mind.   Therefore, they are good now and have been good.  The complaint I read a lot at the start was some thinking they wanted a joystick over touchpad.   I thought the worst controllers by reputation were things like the windows mixed reality but I suppose they are no longer on the market.  

People grew to dislike the vive controllers because they seemed weak in specific build areas such as the known touchpad breakages.  More recently, the hard to replace batteries is another dislike that is being felt.   They are way too expensive making it a painful thing to deal with.


A lot of noise was created against the vive controllers but to me it just seems like alternatives and the usual thing of people justifying their purchases.  Things like the valve index controllers seemed incredibly overhyped especially before release.",Vive
That seems almost to good to be true... I hope you didn't get scammed or something.,Vive
"You will probably have some form of VR sickness to start but most likely it will be mild. 

As soon as you have any sort of VR sickness stop playing until it goes, people often say ginger beer/ale can help.
THIS IS IMPORTANT. DO NOT TRY TO POWER THROUGH! A lot of people make that mistake and you will definitely regret it if you try!

There are a very few people who never get over it, but the vast majority will find their play sessions get longer and longer until they no longer feel bad.

When you first get it try out some cockpit based games first (racing, flight space sims), they give you a fixed viewpoint and help minimise sickness, and build yourself up to a full locomotion FPS (which are the worst for bringing on the sickness).

As someone else mentioned almost every game comes with comfort options these days, so they'll default to teleport locomotion with snap turns and vignetting during movement, all of which help, but don't worry, soon enough you'll be able to turn it all off and enjoy the games however you want, sickness free!",Vive
"I always felt that the Vive is better than the CV1, but I don't think it's worth buying if you already have a CV1. It's probably better to save up for an Index kit, or the Vive Pro kit if you want wireless.",Vive

"I found the Vive to be uncomfortable after an hour or so with the base head strap, but with the DAS it's comfortable to use for hours. But people are different, some will prefer the base strap.

For me, the DAS was a really great purchase.",Vive
"Don't worry about it. Lots of people have tried my set up, no one was ever sick. 

Not that nausea never happens anymore, but it was much more of a problem in the early VR days due to poor game design and hardware. Devs had no idea how to do locomotion and also the early headsets (Oculus rift  DK1) didn't even have full head-tracking (rotation only) and was only 60 Hz. To top it off, it seemed every time you saw it being demoed, it was a roller coaster simulator.",Vive
Stuffing ragdolls in a locker and slow mo gunplay isn't exactly new.   The guy playing it looks like he's pretending to have fun.,Vive
"I used to have motion sickness when in car when I was younger. 

With my Vive I experienced motion sickness only when playing Subnautica. It is little bit difficult to navigate in the ocean using only your headset (especially because of the cord, wireless would be perfect) so I was using my PS4 gamepad to control camera and motion. Not good.

Other games were fine - Skyrim, Fallout, Beat Saber etc.",Vive
"Also can be mostly avoided by having short 10-15 min sessions at first, and taking off the headset if you start to feel iffy.",Vive
I don’t think anyone in the world prefers vice controls.... lol,Vive
90% of Rec Room users choose to use smooth locomotion. Can't be too bad.,Vive
"Have to agree here too. It's been effective, and having the integrated headphones and tension knob at the back are like mandatory now.",Vive
"&gt; Are games playable with the OG Vive are playable with the Vive Cosmos?

That is a logically untenable question. Think about it:

 1. If you've already bought games for the Vive, then you've already got the Vive, and therefore don't care whether the games are compatible with budget headsets.
 2. If you *haven't* already bought games for the Vive, then you have no reason to care what games made for the Vive are compatible with.

Either way, there's no way you should be asking that question. But the two untenable answers are:

 1. Do you already own a Vive? If so, it doesn't matter whether the games work with the Cosmos: You've already got the better version of the Cosmos.
 2. Do you *not* already own a Vive? If so, buy a Vive, and buy games for it. It won't matter whether the games work with the Cosmos: You'll already have the better version of the Cosmos.

However, if you're interested in higher resolution displays, I do recommend having a look at the HTC Vive Pro headset and the Valve Index headset.",Vive
"Yeah, the touch pad issue Can be a real bummer, it was the first thing to go then it stopped syncing with my light house. I ended up buying a second Vive setup, minus the base station because it was cheaper than getting a couple new controllers, plus I had spare lighthouses and an extra hmd.",Vive
\^ This,Vive
"I think they are excellent for their intended purpose. Valve's vision was always to avoid ""gamey"" interactions - multiple button combinations, smooth locomotion via the gamepad etc.

When viewed in this context a lot of the design decisions make sense. The grip was always meant to be a toggle (I still think this was a mistake but you can see why the design makes more design in this light). 

The trackpad was intended to have multiple uses as you can see in the welcome tutorial. Valve always assumed teleport was the way forward due to VR sickness (and they might still be right - we are yet to get beyond niche adoption by enthusiasts who are prepared to ""get their VR legs"". That might not work for the next million).

Personally speaking I like the weight - especially in Beat Saber.

And having done a ton of public demos I can assure you that handing them to someone who's not a gamer and has never used a VR controller before requires MUCH less explanation that when you hand them a Rift, Index or Windows MR controller.",Vive
"Some have it worse than others. I'm not prone to motion sickness at all, I've been on small boats, big ships, no problem, but VR made me a bit nauseous the first few times.

A friend of mine tried VR racing on my sim rig and almost instantly felt like he was going to puke, I've never had that feeling, so some definitely have it worse than others.

Touch pad locomotion, or any type of smooth transitional motion (like driving) will make you feel weird at first, that's a guarantee. Whether that feeling ever goes away depends on the person unfortunately.

Like others have said, you get used to it and build up a tolerance over time. The only thing that will still affect me (and  the probably goes for most people) is if you play with a inconsistent frame rate, sometimes it's imperceptible, but your brain will still somehow still realize somethings not right.",Vive
Oooh good deal,Vive
agree with a lot but tracking...inside out will never be better than base stations,Vive
I personally wouldn't bother CV1 to OG Vive. The tracking and FOV is better although screendoor is worth. Better to say the money and go Rift S / Vive Pro / Index straight away. I think you'll only end up spending more in the long run going step by step,Vive
"It’s different for everyone.
For me I was quite lucky as I’ve never gotten motion sickness before on boats and stuff. So I found that when I bought my vive I can go forever and not feel anything, even walking instead of teleporting is fine for me.",Vive
"I found running the Vive with the R9-380x, often running into the same issues. Usually when the card started to overheat (It was a space heater back when I had it). I doubt ram speed is the issue since I was running on DDR3, 1600. The issues likely are compatitbily, like your SteamVR / graphics card settings.",Vive
"Most games have teleport which is perfectly fine. There's no motion sickness if you teleport. Mostly it happens with smooth motion for those that are sensitive to it,  like me. I just use teleport.
Sometimes you can get motion sick from low frame rates, or poorly designed games that make the mistake of moving the scene around you but its not common.  AAA games never make that mistake.",Vive
"I have motion sickness in bumpy car rides. Zero in VR. I think, not being a doctor, that motion sickness happens when your eyes are seeing what your body doesn’t follow. Hence some badly done VR games do that.

My advice is to get your eyes measured for IPD and make sure the setting is spot on, and take some time getting the straps adjusted just so. Once they’re firmly in place and the headset doesn’t wobble with your movement (it is SUPER important that the headset is 1:1 with your head), you should get your VR legs pretty quickly. Enjoy!",Vive
"I paid the same amount for the OG Vive when it came out, but the Index is much better in every regards and not more expensive. 

I think it is worth every cent if you use it daily like I do.",Vive
"The question is, do you want to have better VR now (Rift-S) until you upgrade, or *maybe* save some money and make do with an obsolete headset &amp; controllers (Vive).

I think the money saving aspect here is not that clear anyway. If you upgrade from Rift-S to the Index, you can just sell the full Rift-S system which will be easier to sell and probably retain more of its value. Selling a Vive headset &amp; controllers without lighthouses will not be as easy.",Vive
I’ll be happy to take it at that price 🙂 PM me to arrange,Vive
It's dead Jim.,Vive
"Most games will give a motion sickness option that creates a vignette when moving which helps DRASTICALLY. I've only had one game in particular give me bad motion sickness, which was subnautica. I dont know if there's a generic app you can download that does something like this in all games, but that might be a place to start. Then just slowly reduce the vignette amount til there's nothing.",Vive

"Doesn't matter which HDMI version (1.4, 2.1, etc)?",Vive
"Only if you plan on upgrading to Index parts down the road. The Vive on its own is a sidegrade from the Rift CV1. Better tracking but worse controllers and comfort (unless you have DAS or another mod for the mount). 

$350 is most of the price of a set of new lighthouses though, which will make upgrading to Index parts much more affordable down the line, so that would be the primary benefit IMO. Plus you can probably still get a solid amount back selling your CV1.",Vive
"When I first played some games with joystick movement I felt like I was levitating (hard to explain lmao) and would get a mild headache after a half hour. 

The best thing you can do is stop playing if you feel sick or get a headache. After a week or two it went away for me, I can cruise around in Stormland for ages without any issues at all. Just don't push it!",Vive

Very few people actually prefer wands to touch. If touch could be used natively, most people would switch to that.",Vive
I got a little queasy first time I played mine. Next day I was dogfighting in war thunder no problem,Vive
Google Earth,Vive
I'm specifically asking for *why* the Vive wands are bad.,Vive
"Unfortunately I don't. I haven't found it on thingiverse yet, but I'll definitely keep looking!",Vive
"Of all the people I've demoed to, only one has trouble with motion sickness and even then, can handle smooth locomotion in many titles - just not all.",Vive
"The ideas behind wands were not bad, but ultimately, using touchpad to simulate more interactivity and for locomotion is just subpar compared to buttons and thumbstick. The grip toggle button is awful for immersion.
I prefer having swappable batteries that can last days with normal usage, compared to charging Vive wands daily.

Wands didn't do anything right, they were just the first 6dof on the market and it shows.",Vive
"Thanks, will check it out when I get the chance.",Vive
"Yeah I think it's the exact opposite. I think the vive wands are trash and it's Vive owners trying to justify their purchases saying they aren't that bad. 

They are absolutely significantly worse than the Ocullus touch controllers and the knuckles. They aren't as immersive and aren't as well designed. I literally don't think there is one game where I'd prefer to use them.

So really I think it's just Vive owners trying to convince themselves they haven't been playing a gimped experience the last two years because everyone with a touch controller has been experiencing immersion and interaction pretty close to the knuckles (although not quite that level of immersion).",Vive
"They are bad once you get sweaty. So in Beat Saber they just become slippery. Otherwise I think they are perfectly fine for whatever. But they are more than 3 years old. The Vive was more or less the first and everything that's come since has learned. It's natural that new products have improved upon the old in some way.

The Vive Wands are really sturdy in my experience. I've been flailing about for nearly 2 years with these things and have hit them on things quite a few times. I'm definitely not getting rid of them when my Index controllers arrive.

9/10 controller but times have changed.",Vive
"It'll work, but it's realistically on the bottom end of the VR spectrum. If you can't afford to upgrade I think you should just go for it - for a long time I ran my Vive with a sub-par graphics card and I was able to have a lot of fun with it.

You'll run into a wall with some of the higher end games, though. On a flat screen, you're fine to play games that dip in framerate, but that's just not an option in VR for the most part.

For now, I'd dip my toe into VR with the laptop you've got and start saving up for an upgrade. It's more cost effective to build a desktop for this purpose, but if you need to use a laptop for whatever reason there are plenty of options out there that are powerful enough.",Vive
"I generally agree. I think they're regarded as the ""worst"" controllers for two factors: enthusiasts who want the maximum number of control options at their fingertips, and the build quality + crap HTC support.

I have an Index set up at home, and my old Vive boxed up that I can demo with my laptop. When I demo the Vive, people take to the controllers very intuitively. Working with them requires barely any explanation.

I will say, on games that properly implement the knuckles controller, finger tracking is MORE intuitive than the Vive wands, but these games are pretty rare for now, and the cost of the technology might keep them rare for a while to come.",Vive
Where’s the space ship I can pilot and design?,Vive
"I don't think I can sell a used Index for full-price and still manage to afford an Index which is about $1,000 for everything, and I plan to save up for  valve index controllers",Vive
Yeah. It’s not a bad start but it’s shy of what I’m looking for.,Vive
"As I said, recording my voice. For YouTube purposes. I want to tip my toes in the water for recording VR gameplay with a good microphone for my voice, No one wants to hear a mic that sounds like it came from 1998",Vive
Someone mentioned bad performance. If I notice performance issues or tracking issues I close my eyes until the HMD gets working again. Sometimes even losing screens can cause that sick feeling,Vive
"alright well... Sounds like you're looking for nothing less than Space Engineers VR, so why even ask?",Vive
"No I mean, I want to fly, and build. Doesn’t have to be as in depth. Just space and building. I actually saw a game that looks like it may be as according to rumors or may have vr support on launch, but I want a game in space with flight and building.",Vive
"What’s that game like, before I spend 40 bucks.",Vive
"Yeah. That’s why I’m hesitant. Granted, if I could get subnautica to work full vr, I think I can be tided over for a bit. (I want to pilot my seamoth with controllers, my cyclops the same, and a prawn suit the same)",Vive
Even controller support? If so I’ll give it a go.,Vive
"Unless you’re in Canada, it’s not $1000 since you already have base stations. Spending extra money on a mic for the vive really isn’t worth it. Just use that money plus sell the vive headset only and then save up for the $500 headset only. It’s well worth it over the controllers",Vive

"Same issue with Vive Pro, MSI Z370 Gaming Plus, i7 8700k 5ghz. Tried fan, different cables, pcie slots, batteries (Two HTC and ASUS ZenPower). Maybe Anker will help with 24W output power, ordered one. I tested some cables with USB-tester and picked a best one with smallest voltage drop.

I updated my motherboard to ASRock Z390 Taichi Ultimate but issues still there, but i didn't tried different PCI-E slots on new mobo, still testing.

"They're fine if you don't compare them to some of the newer controllers that have been released since then. ;)

Compared to other controllers (especially index) they are really bulky and awkward-feeling to use. They just seem very clunky and out-of-place for general VR interactions after using the more ergo-friendly Index controllers. The difference is pretty major after getting used to the smaller, more comfortable index or touch controllers. 

For some actions (like swinging swords) it's nice to have the weighted feeling of the wands in your hand but, for most everything else, it's just another layer of abstraction that adds more undesirable separation between your virtual reality and the real world.",Vive
Ok this is bullshit. Now the second hand Vive is apparently out of stock too.,Vive
"It happens in situations where your character/perspective moves, but your physical movements don't match. For most games this isn't a problem though.",Vive
It does work.  I use Natural Locomotion and two steam controller dongles which enables walk-in-place locomotion.  I just use those phone arm-band holders and strap it around my calf.  They also work for games that actually use leg/foot tracking (eg. Blade and Sorcery).,Vive

"I'm upgrading to a 9900k and a new mobo, I can update post upgrade.",Vive
"The vive itself is pretty comparable to the CV1. I think that the touch controllers are actually a little nicer than the vive wands. The tracking on the vive is definitely better, but if you already have 3 sensors set up for the CV1 it will be marginally better, you probably won't notice the difference most of the time.  So... you should consider that you are paying $350 basically for a side-grade. If you can sell the CV1 kit for some amount of money maybe it is worth it, but otherwise valve sells the V2 basestations for $150 each, and if you're getting the knuckles anyways you don't need the old vive wands, so you're basically paying $50 for a headset that isn't really any different (not counting the fact that the new basestations are arguably better). 

I think if you can find the kit used on ebay or craigslist or something for $250 total it's probably worth it to be able to upgrade easily in the future, $350 is a hard sell for me given that you already have a CV1.",Vive
"Yeah, I have to agree with you. The quest is a great headset... for its use case, and the cable just increases its value. If you want the best, the answer is still not the quest. But, the freedom that it gives is pretty damn awesome. Like, bringing it to a family party for instance.",Vive
"&gt; THIS IS IMPORTANT. DO NOT TRY TO POWER THROUGH! 

2nd this. it will only make it worse next time

I get sim sickness, my advice is to stop as soon as you feel any signs of sim sickness. Stop, put it down, go walk around or something to re-orient your senses.  Also finding a game that's a milder experience will allow you to stay in longer and develop your vr legs a little easier.",Vive
I read that about 15% of people get motion sick from vr and don't get over it.  Some people experience it at first but get used to vr and it goes away.,Vive
"Space Pirate Trainer is a simple bullet shooter, but loads of fun! 
Headphones are a must.  This is the game that really sold the room space for me when I picked up an OG Vive.

Definitely check out Tilt Brush.  Drawing with different brushes and colors is really something else.  It can be refreshing to do something soothing and not action related.   I usually just sit on the floor when I play this one.

When I have friends over we usually play Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.    Watching people get all nervous over this game is great!   Having a printed out menu put in a binder on the shelf makes it super easy to hand someone to get started.  

Skyrim VR, now hear me out.    Right now it is on sale for 18 bucks.  With just a few mods, and an edit to the ini file this game evolves from a frustrating buggy mess to an incredible experience.  

I really dig the racing scene so once I found out 
[Dirt Rally can be used with the Vive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8mkft7hHXg) I was thrilled.

Hope this helps get you started.",Vive
"I used both, and for me the Vive isn't an upgrade from a CV1, it's the same generation of headset. Vive has better tracking, CV1 is more comfortable. They are about the same graphic-wise. I would look for the Index, or even wait for the next generation.",Vive
"As someone who has a history of motion sickness, I highly recommend the Vive, I merely recommend avoiding direct motion controls, and do highly recommend Natural Locomotion to control your direct motion by walking in place.",Vive
"I'd suggest zooming down to Mirror Lake in Yosemite, sit back and enjoy the views.",Vive
"Be aware that the world moving when you are not will make you sick. Its a ticking time bomb really. If you use a thumbstick to move the camera and you fly around completley disregarding g forces it will build up in your system.   Some people can handle hours of it, some people can handle seconds.

This tolerance builds up pretty quickly though.


The other thing is pupil swim which is what people report with the gearvr mod. The lens arnt shaped right and ad you move your head from left to right focing on an object in the vr space youll see the world warp slightly as you move. 

This will also get you sick. 

Haveing a low spec VR system will also make you sick, any latency or stuttering low fps will definitely make you sick, no amount of tolerance build this up from what ive found.

All in all, ive only got motion sick after 3 years of vr after playing weird indie tech demo games where you fly around the world with thimbsticks.  Theres a specific way to implement this and a lot of indipendant games dont care",Vive

Just to be clear, that is going to get VERY expensive, VERY quick, and not to mention there brobably will be issues with getting consistent quality. Lapels and headset style mics exist for a reason and should be the first choice, but if that absolutely won't work, I guess a custom solution might be possible.",Vive
"I'd argue that the standard WMR controllers are significantly worse, at least for the basic WMR headsets.  The permanently paired ones with the Samsung Odyssey and Odyssey+ are significantly better, but the ones you have to pair to your own Bluetooth transceiver will drive you insane.",Vive
"I saw this coming a MILE away - its almost hard for me to understand how many people missed the obvious red flags of this dev team or the negative feedback coming from testers. 

Some devs delay with good reason, but when these dudes delayed the game a second time, hours prior to release, you had to have known something was up. Instead, all we heard were a bunch dumbasses saying, ""Well you know what they say, a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad!""",Vive

"I’ve got the vive and honestly I would just save up for the index or another comparable outside in tracking headset. I don’t have a rift or a quest so a lot of this is just going off what I’ve seen in reviews so take it with a grain of salt. From what I’ve heard the tracking is better but not by all that much ( compared to the rift s and quest ) so that is a plus for the vive but the controllers seem to be a lot worse on the vive. The controllers are heavy, don’t fit very well in your hand, and have some buttons that are pretty hard to reach. Again  spending $350 on a vive would be an upgrade in some way but a major downgrade when it comes to the controllers so I would just save up for a index if you have your heart set on outside in tracking.",Vive
"WMR controllers are better in the regard that they have a usable grip button and an analog stick.

They suck ergonomically though, which is why I rate them about equally bad. I haven't had any Blutooth pairing issues with mine so I can't comment about that. (HP Reverb)",Vive

A fast enough video card to maintain 90 FPS is \*critical\* to a good VR experience.  It's possible to also have a decent experience with 45 FPS with reprojection.  But if your card is too weak to maintain exactly 45 or 90 FPS you will experience motion sickness.

Start slow with VR.  And taking ginger has been known to ease motion sickness if you feel it.  If you feel uneasy, take off your HMD and take a long break or a nap.  It takes many users awhile to get their ""VR legs"".  Once you do it is well worth it.",Vive

I cannot stress this enough though - you want one that is barely used - BUT PUT THE HEADSET ON AND SMELL IT YO.  Used headsets can carry a smell from trashy people that have scented households - or it smells like smoke.  You cannot get these smells out.

Odyssey tracking sucks ass imo, but do not need base stations which seem to be a bigger deal with some people. Forget trying to use a bow in skyrim comfortably though. The tracking only covers where the camera sees. Steam VR base station tracking&gt;any other tracking method. 

Odyssey controllers use aa batteries and lose tracking constantly due to using the camera on the hmd.

Odyssey resolution is high than Vive pro

Fitness bar grants you high jump, makes you faster and you can swim on water.
Fatness bar makes you slow, able to sink underwater, roll downhill and also faster falling.
Healthy bars that heals the player.

The levels includes water, ground, traps, downhills, pushable boxes to help you get to high places, healthy bars and buttons.

The idea is that you must not spent too much bars get trough the levels, and that you need to use the right bars in the right situations.",Vive

Resolution on the O+ is fantastic - easily on par with Vive Pro if not a bit better IMO. 

I personally don’t mind the WMR controllers, but the Vive controllers feel more comfortable to me. I’m always worried about banging the large rings on the WMR controllers into something. 

As far as tracking, WMR isn’t terrible; but it’s no where near as accurate as the lighthouse tracking. Not a dealbreaker to me, but it takes some getting used to. You just have to adjust your play style to ensure the HMD can always see the controllers. 

Overall, the O+ is pretty awesome, and my Vive honestly hasn’t been touched since getting the O+ last year.",Vive

"The most common reason a person gets sick in VR is from artificial locomotion. This is where what you see doesn't match your physical movements. Like if you play a first person shooter and you ""walk forward"" with the joystick but not in real life.

Now, it's more complicated than just move camera and get somebody sick. It depends on how you move the camera and how fast you move it. Some people are get sick faster and some are immune. There is a lot of research going into be able to do artificial locomotion and minimize the risk somebody gets sick from it.


You won't have to worry about this for HLA because Valve will not require you use artificial locomotion. There are other ways people get sick in VR (like the PC can't keep a steady frame rate) but for the most part we have solutions that make them a non issue for the vast majority of the population.

TL;DR: Unless you are incredibly unlucky I would not worry about getting sick in VR from HLA. Valve knows what does and doesn't get people sick in VR and they ensure almost nobody gets sick playing there game using the default settings.",Vive

"Regarding the finger tracking, no one can see your gestures in Pavlov other than you. I was, however, able to stick my pinky out like a proper gentleman in Onward and people could see it.",Vive
"I bought a bulk box of lens cleaners.

Every day I wipe them off before I start playing with a single wipe.

It's the clearest I've ever experienced.

This is on a Vive OG with custom lenses",Vive
"wow, good for you!

it's not available here in norway.",Vive
"Thanks man, can you link me to what you use?

Im also still looking for any other solutions/recommendations I may be able to do today from home.",Vive
I’ll say it. UploadVR is compromised.,Vive
"From home idk. Are you in the US by chance? I'll grab an Amazon link from the US 

I use these: 
[amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NCOUY05/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_6bz4DbNH8H12Z)

Don't use on a PSVR if you have one though. Their lenses has a coating that gets wiped away with these.

Does anyone in your family wear glasses or a camera? I would recommend using that cleaning material/tools",Vive
"Thanks. Im in the US, ill check it out. My brother wears glasses, is it totally safe to use the cleaner he uses then?",Vive
"Idk what he has for a cleaner but I'd use those cloths.

Worse comes to worse you can replace lenses for better ones for $50 haha.


But it's up to your budget of course.

I use the wipes on my custom lenses. I have friends that use similar wipes on their og lenses.

Idk what his glasses cleaning solution has though tbh if he has that",Vive
"wireless mod mic, attach mic to HMD",Vive
"Also, are you sure bomeworks or Pavlov is outa the picture, I'm sure alyx is, but those two games say I'm in the clear don't they?",Vive
"That's strange... I bought 3 and was only charged once for shipping. They're gone now anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter, but if they all come in one box you might try asking support about that.",Vive
"The poor durability of the touchpad is quite inexcusable, however.",Vive
The newest ryzen are great. You will need to get a new motherboard and ram to use it though,Vive
"I bought the Index and returned it and am sticking with my Rift S. We also have a Quest. I would choose both Oculus headsets over the Index.

With the addition of Oculus Link you would be better off saving money, buying a cord to use for Link with Quest, and wait for the next gen headset to invest into. Could also buy the Vive DAS and make that Quest way comfier. 

Index controllers were neat but still have quality control issues. FOV and refresh was better but the glare was terrible. It just wasnt a big enough increase to warrant the huge price.",Vive
You shouldn't have to but I think you might be able to fix this with steam bindings. I vaguely remember being able to set the grip button to toggle its state,Vive
"As someone who's tried Vive/Rift(S)/WMR/Index controllers and demoed the Vive/Rift/Index to lots of people, I would say the Vive does a really good job at interacting within VR space. It feels intuitive and is the easiest controllers to introduce people into VR. 

And for games like PavlovVR, the Vive controllers are the best for high level playing (according to my experience and many good/pro players I've played with). This isn't coming from someone who's trying to justify an old purchase. This is coming from someone who routinely swaps between Index/Vive controllers since both offer good experiences in their own ways. If I didn't care about the Vive wands I would've thrown them in the trash or sold them as soon as I got the Index.

I wouldn't just dismiss an entire crowd and discussion over your own subjective opinion.",Vive
"It's the other way around: Rift S does almost everything better than the OG Vive. Biggest problem is IPD. If yours is very wide or narrow, you just won't be able to use the Rift S without problems.",Vive
I did not think about this at all but your totally right. Its stealth lite with fun guns to take down baddies!,Vive
"Ah, I’m glad to be wrong then! I’ve tested my IPD and it’s around 61.7 which I believe is in the right range. Thanks for the info!",Vive
"That should be no problem, right.",Vive
"This is the first game that didnt feel like an asset flip, you kidding? Clearly you havnt played any of the dribble coming out of steam.",Vive
Im thinking its the huds distance away from tge face.,Vive
"Some games just really have your number. I have over 100 VR games in my library and the only one that messes with me is ADR1FT, which ruins my day after around 15 minutes in game.",Vive
"Yeah, I've experienced this and was able to fix my controllers. Design flaws happen. Oculus has one with their audio on the CV1 and Valve has one with their new controllers.

It's really hard to say how much impact these problems as we don't have real numbers and only reddit posts/complaints.",Vive
"Hahahah, what? I think you're confused. The graphics look worse than in a lot of 1 man projects, all the assets are super generic, you could probably make something similar by buying a random asset pack for several dollars, there's tons of bugs, AI is total garbage and all the interactions feel janky as hell.

I don't want to know what the hell have you been playing to make this game look good, and I don't think i wanna know, lol.",Vive
"now that i think of it, this could be the issue, because the other game that made me feel similarly nauseous was wolfenstein cyberpilot and had a symilar hud",Vive

Is there any sales on vive port? Also is it any good?,Vive
my favorite thing is trying to run in Onward without throwing a magazine off of my belt.,Vive
Are you using that roll cage thing?  They added that to Killing Floor and it made me want to puke.,Vive
The wands are fine even grip to grab works fine for me tbh.,Vive
Was thinking about trying to make a little heroku app or something to notify me. I've also tried vpning to all sorts of regions. you can buy them globally for like 50 bucks more sadface.,Vive
"Stealth games live or die by the AI and the AI in this game is far, far from adequate. I refunded quite quickly when I realised this. There's no 'visibility cone' or distance/shadows/light exposure and the bare-ass mechanics that do exist feel very shallow and shoddy. It doesn't look like there's any plan to overhaul it neither so if you're looking for a true-to-form stealth game in the vein of MGS or even similar to the Thief games you'll be super disappointed. If you still get a buzz from just walking around and climbing in VR space then get after 'er.",Vive
"Its because of alyx.
No real black friday deal on the index.
Its in production so you just have to wait for it to be ready for shipping.
The earlier you buy the earlier you will get it.
It will maybe not reach out for boneworks though",Vive
"Vive discrete tracking is marginally better than the rift S inside out tracking. But it's one of those things where, a small difference to some, is HUGE to others. I'd go to the microsoft store if you have one to try it out. 

I've always found the rift controllers much more comfortable than the wants... BUT...

With more games like boneworks coming out, I mean, we are talking game changing experiences like the first time you played vr, by using the index controllers.

So... do you have the money to get the index controllers? Go vive.

Do you think you'll want the index controllers in the next 3,6,12 months and want to have an available upgrade path? Go vive.

If neither of those concern you, you want ease of setup, portability, and after testing you find the tracking difference to be negligible, go rift s. 

A used vive 1 and new rift s are practically the same price. Also all the vive manuals are online and the setup is done in steam if that's sways your purchase at all.",Vive
It is totally worth it. You can also get a really good texture mod to improve it even more.,Vive
Yeah at this point I don't think it will make it in time. Was pushing it trying to order last night. Heck.,Vive
"Same for me. But i dont care if it arrives tomorrow or in 2 weeks.
At least we get alyx for free wich is making the knuckles a bit more affordable",Vive
"1) poor quality control so there is a bunch of RMA happening.  The HMD has been out of stock for ~month now, and lots of index controllers have actuation &amp; drift issues

2) orders opened up internationally, so people who have been waiting since launch can finally buy one

3) Alyx was announced, added a spike to sales

"For extra context to his comment, the Rift S has these things over the OG Vive:

* Simpler setup with just a single USB 3.0 cable and a DisplayPort cable.
* Much higher resolution display
* No sensor setup required
* Halo headstrap
* Integrated speakers

However, it does have these cons compared to the Vive:
* Small areas of lost controller tracking behind your head, although in practice it ""guesses"" correctly most of the time
* No upgrade path to the Index if you wanted to buy just the controllers down the line

[Issues with 4 index base stations and left index controller?](/r/Vive/comments/e3ot84/issues_with_4_index_base_stations_and_left_index/) by  PyPaw


Hello! Since I bought my index and attempted to use 4 base stations, the left controller would have fits for about 1-2 minutes of just flying off into space. This happens very often at like maybe every 15 to 20 minutes. It happens less often if I use 3 base stations and very rarely when I use only 2 base stations. Is something going on? Am I doing something wrong? I can't figure out why 4 would be the worst experience for me. All this said, this only affects my left index controller.

I’ve had great luck with my 1070 and OG Vive for the past couple of years of VR. I’d consider getting a 1070 if you’re looking to Vive on the cheap. I’m still rocking one and haven’t been let down.,Vive
If it’s out of warranty don’t even bother with HTC. Although if you bought it on a credit card you might want to check to see if you got an extended warranty through your credit card company.,Vive
"not sure what kind of customization you mean but:

you can  go on any planet and start building a base as if it were minecraft
underwater works too, even has parts specific for it 
you can customize your ship with different upgrades or add more inventory slots, but as far as i know it isnt ""customizable"" when it comes to  outward appearances
you can buy a space freighter (big ship for  your smaller ships) and even that can be built inside of as if it were  a mini portable base
and obviously you  can customize your character and get new mutitools

its kinda like space engineer in  the sense that its set in space and has base building elements but it does have some restrictions: you cant build in space
and you can make a ship from scratch like in space engineers

but, we just got a QOL update with the devs hinting that another big update is coming soon-ish

id say keep an eye out for when it drops and make your descision  then on whether you want to buy no mans sky

this comment could be outdated by the time it hits",Vive
"they appeared to be available earlier today, i'm hoping it comes back for cyber monday. i'm considering getting the pro at this point",Vive
"I'm not sure, maybe somebody else here knows where to check the status of that. What region of the country are you in? I wonder if it's showing limited availability based on IP address",Vive
"I just bought the last new Vive in NZ, but there doesn't seem to be any DASs in Oceania. Hecking frick",Vive
"Index is the premium VR headset atm, and this is the priciest. Highest fov, resolution, and refresh rate, and it comes with the most cutting edge and immersive controllers to use in VR. But you'll also need a very recent GPU to avoid any issues with demanding games, a GTX 1070 at minimum. The Index is tethered to your PC by default, like the Vive.

Oculus has three headsets, and is targeted towards a more mainstream audience. They have a much lower price point, and the controllers have a good, comfortable design that works great in most VR titles. The CV1 is the oldest, so it has a noticable screen door effect, a limited fov, and requires 3 external sensors to get full 360 degree tracking. But it runs great and is comfortable to wear. The Quest and Rift S have inside out tracking and better resolution, so no external sensors are required, although the hand tracking behind you might not be as great. I'm not sure on that though. The Quest has a built in gpu so it can run some games without a PC, which is nice for ppl new to VR gaming, but what's cool is you can now tether it to a PC and have it work similarly to the CV1, so I think overall it's likely the best Oculus option atm that is affordable. 

The Vive is similar in a lot of ways to the cv1 specs wise. However it's bulkier and doesn't come with headphones. It does has some nice camera features, and the lighthouse tracking system is much more precise than Oculus sensors. Some people love the Vive wands, which are very durable, but I prefer the Knuckles or Touch controllers imo. If you start with a vive, you can mix and match components with the Index kit should you upgrade later.

Hope this helps!",Vive
"I agree, either would be a good choice for first time VR guys/gals.  I currently have a pre-ordered Cosmos and I would not recommend looking at one until it's tracking issues are resolved.  Otherwise, the Cosmos is a very nice headset.  It's easy to setup and works well with the Vive Cosmos Wireless Adapter kit.  My gut feeling is that it will require a new Steam Faceplate Module (supposed to come out 1st Qtr 2020) plus base stations/controllers for very good tracking.  In the meantime I am mainly using my good old Oculus Rift cv1 w/2x sensors.",Vive
"EDIT: Oculus doesn't sell the CV1 anymore. The Rift S is the successor. They do sell another hmd call Oculus Go, which like the Quest can run a limited number of games in it without a PC. 

 The Go is very rudimentary and entry level. I wouldn't recommend that to start.",Vive
I personally used two very small-cut squares of duct tape to 'bump up' the nubbin.  Works a treat.,Vive
I think they have been US-only for a while.  I had several on hand from when they were sold in Canada.  I'm going to see if I can get a few more through a US pickup service.,Vive
"I got a vive just 2 months ago and am already ready to upgrade to the next level, which means the Index. Such a shame HTC screwed up with the Cosmos.",Vive
"If you have the USB stick sold with the Steam Controller, you can use it (1 for 1) to pair a single wand as a 3rd tracker.  A second USB stick means a 4th tracker, etc., up to - I believe - 6 *TOTAL*, which means 4 extra trackers plus the 2 normal controllers with your Index.

I would absolutely verify this somewhere else before dropping the money.",Vive
Well poo.  Who knew?,Vive
"What I meant was that the last of the stock is slowly being released to the US market only, UK stock is gone. There are no more, sold out, finished! Some US users are claiming that they can still buy but that's it, gone!",Vive
"Yes. If you got the Vive, hold the grip button on one of the wand while pointing the dashboard window and it should remain when you close the dashboard. You can also use both grip button at the same time to resize it too (while in dashboard).",Vive
I have one of my base statins at a little above 3ft and it works fine. They just say the height to avoid occlusion.,Vive
"I mean, even if it WASN’T true, it’s only like $20 on some hardware that could help fix my stuff later!

"I have to let a zombie kill me, the reload, just so my body knows I am not really in danger.",Vive
HTC screws up everything. The vive is great because valve designed it.,Vive
"Couldn't really tell you, had them for 3 months and still prefer the wands. The joystick being so far off center makes grabbing with the same hand while trying to move incredibly awkward. I genuinely don't understand the praise these controllers get, I feel the wands are better in almost every way except for the grabbing motion which is practically useless in most games anyway.  Valve was right. I thought I wanted a joystick, turns out the track pads are actually better for most applications.",Vive
showed up as $89 aud here. oh well,Vive
Thanks! I just picked up a few but that shipping fee must be a joke. I'm going to contact Valve to see if there's some way to specify the quantity of items.,Vive

"Its 11:57 PM EST and I was still able to buy one in the US. It did have a warning about possible shipping delays due to high demand, but the order went through.",Vive

"&gt; I should reword: To enjoy all software you need to buy all headsets.

Given any one of those headsets will have more and better software than every headset would without exclusivity, even if you only buy one system you're still better off.

&gt; That's akin to having to buy all monitors to enjoy all software available on PC.

I'd be fine with that.

Naturally there's only going to be a couple of major platforms that will get the bulk of the exclusives, and I could just get a monitor from one of them that would let me play most games that'd be fine.

Obviously it's better if there's the same games but no exclusity, but in an environment where exclusives are viable you get more and better games from them existing.

&gt; Firstly, some of the highest rated and top selling  games in VR don't have a large budget.

Beat Saber is the only example I can think of here.

&gt; That's right, budget doesn't ensure something is good.

It does greatly increase the chance of that though, and dramatically increases the polish. Even if the core game is mediocre, a thick layer of polish still goes a long way - Defector is a good example of this.

&gt; Secondly, exclusivity and platform lock-in is not a prerequisite for big budget games; see Half-Life: Alyx, Elite Dangerous etc.

HL:A is a platform exclusive to SteamVR; given Valve's business model there is simply no advantage to making it an Index exclusvie. Just don't expect it to **ever** show up on the Oculus store, though. And it does certanly contribute to platform lock-in, with Steam/SteamVR being that platform.

Elite Dangerous is not primaraly a VR game; it's a game that exists independently and (IIRC) launched long, long before it's VR mode came out.

&gt; and triple A games

What AAA made-for-VR games are there on Steam? HL:A is the only example I can think of.

&gt; having not bought into the exclusivity-is-healthy propaganda you seem to have lapped up.

It has something to do with being a programmer, I understand how games get made and why money is important to this process, a resource that is sorely absent unless Oculus or Sony get out their checkbooks.

&gt; VR is bigger than gaming and greedy monopolising corporations

The world's biggest tech companies are (with rare exception) greeny monopolistic coporations.

&gt; and deserves better than the disgusting restrictive ideals of console and mobile.

... which are the only platforms they can hope to achieve widespread success.",Vive
"Bought Cosmos, returned it, got Rift S. Night and day difference. Better comfort, better overall clarity (bigger sweetspof), better controllers, MUCH better tracking of both hmd and controllers... for almost half the price. There's nothing to think about.

Either get Rift S or Quest (even better overall hmd (wireless is fantastic), but less comfortable).

I'm not sure how much HTC improved tracking since I returned (constant wobble of both hmd and controllers tracking, controllers were loosing tracking more often than WMR's 2 camera tracking setup), but even if they'll somehow manage to bring tracking quality to Rift S/Quest level, it won't be worth more than $500.",Vive

HTC should have recalled the Cosmos. Don’t buy it. It’s that bad.,Vive

How do you buy more than one at a time so I don't pay individual shipping?,Vive
Doea that VR place in the new(ish) fancy shopping area (opposite that toy shop) not have an index? I tried out the Vive Pro there...just before buying a OG Vive :-),Vive

better placement would be either the red or the blue crossed spots in the image [https://imgur.com/a/LcSBwHb](https://imgur.com/a/LcSBwHb)

"Blue was my first thought, too. Problem there is, that the left blue spot is a chimney and I don´t know if I can drill those boxes into him. Probably not, not sure, though.

Red was my second thought, but the red box has no wall plug anywhere near, so I would need an extension. That´s no problem, but would avoid it if possible.  


If I put them about there ([https://imgur.com/a/L4fISRs](https://imgur.com/a/L4fISRs)) they can see each other and are about 5,50 meters apart, but the left station would probably not see the entire playarea because a bit is obstructed by the chimney. Would that work?",Vive
we tried to buy one yesterday but it was out of stock already,Vive
"I have never experienced this issue, but the simplest solution would be to disconnect your VR headset? SteamVR does not do a whole lot without any HMD connected, but it wouldn't fix it running to some extent of course.

You can also use a tool like Process Explorer to see the process hierarchy. You should be able to make out what launched the SteamVR processes. There's more to it than just vrserver.exe, but iirc it shouldn't automatically restart rather than go into an error state if a key process goes poof. SteamVR Home would be steamtours.exe, but this one does automatically restart if set as Home application.

Note that Steam launches SteamVR when you click the system button on the headset or controllers. VR-enabled web browsers may also launch SteamVR when some website asks for it even if you didn't want to. However, you make it sound like the SteamVR desktop interface isn't coming up, so these are probably not it.",Vive
Quest,Vive
"Unfortunately it's not OLED though, so I'll probably end up going with the 5K+ XR.",Vive
"5m is the official limit i think you would be ok with that distance. 

with the chimney you would have worse tracking in the corner when looking into the corner getting gradually worse. I would expect some tracking problems. but you could mount the lighthouse on the ceilingstep it should improve. 

something like this: [https://imgur.com/a/gTHOslh](https://imgur.com/a/gTHOslh)

"Not as far as I know. The Z6 seems to be a new headset only out this year I believe. I think these are also probably the same lenses as used in their more expensive X6 unit as well. 

I was able to get the Z6 shipped from China for less than $30 and considering it has bluetooth headphones, ipd adjustment and is quite nicely made is nuts. I'd love to have a vive pro to put them in..",Vive

"Drilling is fine, it´s our own house, so noone is gonna complain.

Inside the ceilingstep are pipes, but I asked my Dad and he told me 2-3cm screws are okay to screw in and are able to hold the lighthouse with no problem. I am always amazed by how much thos little things can hold.

Thats how it turned out now. Gonna set it up, should work perfectly, the lighthouses are close to 5 meters apart and I think the Playarea will be limited through the cable, instead of the space, which is perfectly fine.",Vive
Just note the Cosmos display is an LCD which is a huge downgrade from the Vive Pro's AMOLED display.,Vive
"Do you get these errors all the time and they prevent you from even using it or are they intermittent?

First the 10001.9 will show up, then if you reconnect, 10001.15 will happen.  The only cure is a reboot.  There was some consensus that these were caused by the wireless firmware update  1.20190410.0 as no one could remember seeing these errors before that update.  We are now up to 1.20190724.0 so they are still updating the software, just no fix for this glitch :(",Vive
That’s super interesting I haven’t encountered this problem and I have kept the firmware up to date. If I run into it I will let you know,Vive
Is it a launch day adapter or did you buy later on . . . maybe there was a hardware revision at some point?,Vive
It is intermittent and cleared by a reboot.  But very annoying.,Vive
Just ordered one in US.,Vive
"Vive trackers work best if they are slightly outside of your play area, at exactly head height, and at opposite corners of the room.",Vive
They're selling the index in Canada now but I think the steam controller was discontinued so this is probably just clearing old stock.,Vive

So it says its on Alpha022 but only 21 is available for download. So I'm going to use 21 and assume 22 never happened or something. I'm just posting so if there is a 22, somebody can tell me I'm an idiot.",Vive
uuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhh,Vive
"Yeah it took *forever* for the Index to be available though, it just was last (or maybe this?) week. People can bitch about HTC all they want but I had zero issues ordering the Vive on launch day to Canada, and zero issues with support since then.

I think you're right about clearing stock. They did the same thing with the Link (which also was unavailable in Canada for the final sales iirc).",Vive

I prefer the black color,Vive
"If you plan on upgrading to the Index, I would say go with the Vive. From what I’ve heard, the Rift S offers a better experience than the Vive, but buying a Vive will give you access to the Steam VR trackers and controllers that can be quite expensive on their own.",Vive
"&gt; Yeah I wouldn't know anything about that I've only been a full time VR game dev since 2016 with two games released. Clearly I have no clue what I'm talking about so we'll leave it at that.

It completely astounds me that someone working in this industry can't grasp the importance of funding from Oculus and Sony.

Doubt it, Apple has been doing just fine.",Vive
"Brandon explained it, instead of a dumb animation, the AI will figure out the best possible way to rebalance its center of mass (cool, right?) and then proceed to do that, if it looks like an animation it's probably it gets up like we humans do, but that's just because we also do what that ai does, we just don't think about it.",Vive
Yes,Vive
"I'd go Rift S. It'll be a better experience and moves easily. If you ever want the index you'd pretty much have to buy everything again from scratch with the Vive (except the base stations). Also, buying a used Vive is more of a risk.",Vive
"I would hard mount them in the ceiling in opposing corners. Maximize the play area.

And official max distance is 5 meters, some people have been able to get them running further apart..

And you don't need to have the sync cable hooked up, try without them first..",Vive

Do the gear VR lens mod and it will make it ten times better.,Vive
Looks like we will be waiting a while...got a rift a instead,Vive

"I would highly recommend not spray painting it unless you are willing to take the risk of breaking it.

"Checking the mod right now, sounds really good!",Vive

My lens modded wireless cosmos is SWEET! Not everybody is a hater.,Vive
"Spray painting would not be cost effective. The amount of effort you would spend disassembling, painting, and sanding is immense. You basically have to take the entire thing apart and mask off the sensors. 

There's also a pretty huge margin of error in terms of damage to headset even if you're super careful. These things are likely assembled in special clean-rooms, so unless you have one, you're likely going to get dust onto the other side of the lenses or on the screens.

If you start it you'll eventually reach a point where you regret doing so. It's your equipment, and I'm just a guy on the internet, but I'm chiming in to say ""don't do it, you'll regret it.""",Vive
Aqunatics or something like that has a vr mode. Its a collect and build game. But underwater.,Vive
Did you misspell that or is it not a steam? But I can work with that. How is it? Have you played it in vr?,Vive

"I think they mean Subnautica.
Also No Man's Sky is playable in VR with the latest update. (the game is a lot better now than at launch) 
And ofcourse also minecraft",Vive
Subnautica?,Vive
"SubnUticas vr last it tried was lightly put, garbage, though did no mans sky just add a ship building update, I vaguely recall hearing that, cause if so I might launch it back up. (I joined for vr and didn’t get far to say the least.)",Vive
I’ve played that. Never liked the vr mode. Edit. Unless they support controllers and whatnot now.,Vive
Now get the wireless adapter and index controllers and you'll be set,Vive
"I guess it's just the headset without controllers or base stations, right? If so, do you already have the base stations and controllers? The headset alone will not work.",Vive
"it's actually a very dark blue, I was surprised when mine arrived.",Vive
There is this one game that is similar it is a space survival game but you don’t build a space ship you just live in it I will get back to you with the name of the game soon. Star shelter is the game,Vive
You just live in it? Do I get to customize it at least? And is it big enough to walk in?,Vive
"This. Why risk it. It’s like replacing the lenses, except you actually SEE them.",Vive
"Rift S all the way if your IPD is average.

Of course, with the Vive you can upgrade to the Index, Index controllers and use full body tracking with additional trackers. 

But each of these costs multiple hundred dollars. So if you're not prepared to spend a lot more money anytime soon, get the Rift S.",Vive
When you're wearing it you can't see the color.,Vive
"By memory it doesn’t mean VRAM, right?",Vive
No and you definitely shouldn’t try to do something dumb like paint it,Vive
Thank yoooooUUUUU very much. I spaced on the fact that it was on the oculus store.,Vive
I don’t know much I have yet to play a lot of it but you can find some gameplay on draegast YouTube I believe,Vive
"Wait. What was the name again? Though that channels one I haven’t heard in a while.

Edit. It looks he changed his name. But do you mean star shelter? I have it, it’s not bad, it’s quite good actually, but I was looking to pilot.",Vive
"Thinking about it I cant remember it it meant normal ram or vram. I'm not home to test it right now, but when I was watching YouTube earlier my computer crashed without any warning. The monitors turned weird solid colors then they went black. The only things opened were discord and firefox so I'm not really sure what's going on",Vive
"It’s not out yet, but I found a game a while back called “Starbase” that looks a lot like Space Engineers. And if I remember correctly the devs have said that VR support is a strong possibility.",Vive
"Regardless if it’s vr or not, I want it, looks beautiful, but if it’s vr, it’ll be in my libary swiftly from launch, not that I know anything about it yet.",Vive
[removed],Vive
Yep thats it.,Vive
Well no man sky prob closer to what he asked.,Vive
Check out No man's sky! The devs have had SO many HIGH QUALITY updates since launch. Ship building is one of the many things.,Vive
Aren't the base stations a significant cost? I guess I remember reading something like if you start with the vive the actual cost of the index is lowered because it's only a 500 dollar headset.,Vive
"Think u need viveport software. But it is steamvr compatable. 

Have heard its not great tho. You might want to look at another hmd. 

Watch youtube for reviews.",Vive
How customizable is it?,Vive
"Yeah. It is the closest I’ve found, but I was looking more customizable(unless the newest update is particularly customizable.)",Vive
No Man's Sky,Vive
How customizable is it? Though I do like it’s flight mechanics? I haven’t played the new seat update yet.,Vive
I own no man sky but not yet played. Its more of a module builder game than a block by block one.,Vive
Yeah. Does the same go for it’s ships?,Vive
"The quest is more of a render power issue than a screen res issue. 

Quest using link to pc is better than og rift or vive (screen quality wize) but not as clear as rift s (due to compression)

Not used index but its extra fov and lens clarity are supposaly second to none. 

I have a vive and the tracking is best by a good way so index tracking should be as good.",Vive
"You mean modding wise? I dunno I don't really like to mod games much.. If u just mean the building stuff, well I see some mad stuff buying built now, and now u got power cables and power stations and crafting stations and farming stations.. I mean it's VR and ur a space guy who can fly ships and it has a lot of building stuff so I would say its close to it.... Didnt someone do something to make space engineers vr? I thought I heard something about it?",Vive
Im pretty sure you can also buy the dongle separately from valve.,Vive
"Honestly, spray painting isn't the best option.  Just dunk it into a bucket of black paint quick enough to coat it.  Hang it out to dry on a clothesline in direct sunlight for about a day to cure the paint.  Then just find a nice display stand so you can show off your nice black expensive paperweight.  Enjoy!",Vive
"No I mean, I want to design my ship. I want to...alright I’ll be honest with myself. Die in horrific explosions on my terms, caused by my design flaws, my por choices to fly too close to this, from this thruster being attached way to weekly, this pirate that I tried to loot being way stronger than me wiping the floor with me, forgetting oxygen in my design, overestimating how much fuel I have, to feed my custom design. My bad choices in design to fight my actually decent on 2d flight skills, to now my vr flight skills. However while I like building stations I have the bad habit of capital ships that really should be a station but with enough thrust move. Regardless, while I’d like to be able to build stations, ships are the priority. 

Did space engineers get modded to vr? No clue, if so I might be fine with that.",Vive
"its a gorgeous looking game and the world generation is great, but unfortunately after years we are still waiting for survival aspects to be added to the game, just making stuff by yourself gets boring pretty quick especially when there is no chance of dying.

wish the developer had more time to work on the game.",Vive
"So even with oculus link it’s compressed??  Are you sure about that?
Like I said I’m not talking about anything but picture quality here so render quality of quests video card is not important to me.  Planning on using link if I go with quest.  As far as clarity goes, I thought index was using the same fresnel lenses as the vive.  Is this not true?  Thanks",Vive

Good deal,Vive
Does Delux audio strap have a noise-canceling function? I heard that its quality is pretty nice but haven't heard whether it has a noise-canceling function. Does it have it or not?,Vive
"Well the used sets only 350, so if I ever upgraded the set would only essentially cost 100 dollars. Makes it seem like a better investment, though I dont know how the rift s sells on craigslist or anything either.",Vive
"Thaat video card will make for a miserable experience. The CPU is good. RAM is probably too low too though.   
You'd at the very least want to upgrade your GPU (assuming it's a desktop, not a laptop, if it's a laptop you're probably SOL).  I'd be aiming for an RTX 2060 at the least these days.",Vive
"I know the GPU is a weakpoint here and been planning on an upgrade, but the budget isn't big though so I considered like an RX 580 8GB tbh at first or maybe a used 1070? Would an RX580 do the trick you think?",Vive
"I have both.  Yes the Index FOV and clarity is a significant jump.  I use Quest Link on the road with my laptop but miss the Index visuals.  However, Quest does have OLED screen so blacks are better in dark scenes, and that's a nice perk.  Quest lenses are nice too.  But it just doesn't have the res of Index.  That said, it's emphatically, really nice to be able to have Quest link as a mobile package when I don't have space for the Index.  Quest link also does have some shimmering(?) and rendering glitches in games like Skyrim VR where the Index would be perfect.",Vive
"It's marginal. I played for a couple of years on an RX480, it wasn't awful, but it wasn't that great either. The 1070 would be nicer. This is my general goto for ranking of videocards - https://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html  
  
I'd aim to get something over 10,000 if at all possible.",Vive
"Yes, but you still risk buying a used Vive.",Vive

"Looking to pilot? maybe Pulsar lost colony will interest you.

"Yes Oculus link is compressed to fit the bandwidth of USB 3 cable but it's pretty much not noticeable because it's on the peripheral, and perhaps it might make the picture a little more fuzzy.  The bigger issue I notice is pop-in on the edges in Skyrim for example.    


The Index lenses are a huge improvement over the Vive, but they're not perfect.  They're very good with one glaring example (glare in the right setting).  But in outdoors brightly lit spaces-- Skyrim outdoors--they're stunning.  However, due to not being OLED the panels are not so great in the dark dungeons, and then some manifest glare in the lenses.",Vive
Great deal but who Has VR that doesn’t already own these?,Vive
"I've been stuck with the controller config on episode III, can't get past the ""click to continue"" part because it doesn't seem to support the wands.",Vive
Interesting.   Thanks.  I wish there was a brick and mortar place to try one.  This is one of the problems with vr,Vive
"Evidently quite a few.  I cross-posted to r/vive and r/virtualreality and there are comments there asking if these games are ""worth"" picking up at this price.",Vive
[deleted],Vive
I am shocked.,Vive
Art of fight has had the most intuitive and versatile locomotion in VR so far. It was awesome.,Vive
"good deal but dont worry too much, both go on sale pretty often",Vive
"mod mic has some good stuff that would work well, i have the mod mic wireless that i also attach to my normal headset for when sitting at my main station",Vive
I own both flat versions and never cared for either so I never bought the VR.,Vive
Get the Rift-S.  Its better than the old vive. Even though you could re-use the Vive base stations for the Index I'm thinking by the time you can afford the Index there may be an even better headset available on the market.,Vive
"Whole new experience in BR, especially skyrim with mods",Vive
I am running vive wireless with an i5 6600k at 4.2ghz. Seems to do fine for me.,Vive
I dont because half my mods wouldn't work. I tried playing pancake fo4 without mods once and got so bored I stopped playing for 2 years before then deciding it was time to mod the living shit out of it,Vive
"If you want to upgrade to the Index some time, then the Vive might be a good purchase since you can use the same Lighthouses and that will save you $250 on an Index bundle. That is nothing to sneeze at.   


But if it will be a while before you upgrade I would probably recommend a Rift S. Better resolution, slightly worse tracking but still pretty good, and overall a newer product that is still being supported.",Vive
If you like accurate lighting effects then no,Vive
Haha. Welcome to the internet.,Vive
"Me, but I only got my rig yesterday. 😂",Vive
I have a bunch of mods.  Haven't ran across ones that won't work.,Vive
"Just checked this game out on Steam, looks great. If this is VR it's a instant buy in my book.",Vive
Here's me questioning if I ever knew Skyrim had a battle royale mode.,Vive
"Don't get the Cosmos -- the inside out tracking is crap. If you want inside out, grab a Rift S or a Quest and Link cable. Or heck, the Windows MR tracking is somehow better from what I've heard.",Vive
"I bought Skyrim for PSVR, but was waiting for a big deal for PC VR!

I had Fallout though.",Vive
"Me. I already owned both flat games and paid full price, and I wasn't looking at paying full price again for a story I already knew. Now I own both, and only paid for them when they were on special. Was happy to wait too.",Vive
"Same, though suppose you just read that. Nice to see I’d have company there though.",Vive
"Yep, I am agreeing with ya.",Vive
"Just go into a city and punch a child, ez pz",Vive
"That's how I felt about the pancake version of *Skyrim*.  I was totally burned out on ES after putting 1200 hours into *Oblivion* 

VR really immerses you into the *Skyrim* world.",Vive
I don’t know about your processor but overclocking my 6700k from 4.2 to 4.6ghz is the difference between reprojection and no reprojection a good amount of the time. It also makes a big difference in wireless quality for certain games.,Vive
"I have a video comparing a bunch of different mics I've used for YouTube over the years: https://youtu.be/TiR6-V6k92I

Has sample audio of the Mod Mic 5, Audio Technica ATGM2 and the RODE Smartlav+. Timestamps are in the description for each mic.

But long story short, I recommend the Mod Mic 5. The ATGM2 sounds slightly better, but is more sensitive to wind and other environmental sounds. Plus the Mod Mic has a much shorter cable, so if you plug a small USB sound card into the Vive's spare usb port you'll have a pretty neat setup cable wise.

Lapel mics I'm not really a fan of for VR. Can pick up the rustling of your shirt if you're being pretty active.",Vive
I have it. I just lack friends willing to learn the other systems. Do they have a subreddit I could join up with?,Vive
"Same. I got fo4 on launch and never played it beyond that weekend. Such regret. I wouldn't pay for the VR version until it came down to upgrade price.

Now's my time finally.",Vive
[removed],Vive
You stick a tube up their ass to collect methane and then burn it in a biofuel reactor. It all makes perfect sense. Sort of like the matrix in a way. They make energy while living in a virtual world.,Vive
"Out of stock already?  Jeez, Valve really have no confidence in their own product otherwise they would have made a ton of them, and then I could by them in Australia.",Vive
"&gt;Yeah because I don't have an index or quest because this the vive subreddit where, you know, people own HTC vives.

That's how it is now, sadly.",Vive
"In real life? Aight, one sec",Vive
"That sounds like the problem is with the little rubber pad being dislodged. The replacement helps when it does not connect or the haptic function stops working. I filled my wands with some epoxy up to where the rubber pad was. It changes the feel to a bit harder, so it is not as nice, but it doesn't break then.",Vive
Nah,Vive
Yeah it really is. Also thank you for adding in the link to revive,Vive
"Ok, i'll try looking into the rubber pad before I try a replacement. I've never had the wands apart before, is the rubber pad pretty easy to find?",Vive
I played Episode III fine. Which part are you talking about?,Vive
Don't get a cosmos... Please just don't... I've had one and it was really bad... Like really really bad,Vive
Is it possible to copy my DLC &amp; mod setup over from the normal version to the VR version?,Vive
On cdkeys fallout 4 is 6.49,Vive
I wouldn't recommend Fallout 4 VR. It does not include any DLC and the performance is horrible.,Vive
Is motion smoothing enabled?,Vive
My pleasure,Vive
"&gt; gamersgate

That’s a very unfortunate site name.",Vive
"Since the price tags for vr headsets wont drop so fast (they never did) its something to think of.
I bought an outlet vive as a set for 500eur and have to say i dont regret it.
Will upgrade it with the audio strap band and get those fancy knuckles from the index.
Many people dont like the LCD panels used in the new models so many people still go to the vive or vive pro.
Imho its a great deal to get in high class VR (lighthouse) without spending to much money.",Vive
Would anyone who knows their IPD put on a headset and complain about it being out of focus without checking the IPD setting?,Vive
"Make sure the base stations are on channel b and c first of all. If this is checked try updating the hmd or base sations via steam vr.
That helped me out (got the same issue when installed first time)",Vive
You can play it in vorpx.,Vive
"I haven’t heard of that before, do you mean vr pc? Because I still don’t know if that works?",Vive
Untrue. *Fallout 4 VR* performance **was** horrible.  It has significantly improved over the past year.  It still needs a powerful video card to play at max settings.  And performance is much better using Vive over Oculus.,Vive
Even with the performance boost I still have think fallout 4 be isn't worth it. It's a bad and rushed port of fo4. The bare minimum was done to get it into vr and it hasn't really changed much since it was released.,Vive
"I personally loved mine.  It was a much more secure fit, the audio was pretty decent, especially compared to the hassle of wearing ear buds / head phones on top of the strap.  I've upgraded from the OG Vive to an Index now, and the Index has much better audio, but the Deluxe Audio Strap was 100% worth it IMO.  Though I'm not harsh on my hardware, the DAG seems reasonably durable.  If you have it right up to your ear it will easily drown out moderate day to day sounds from outside.",Vive
"It’s great, but the screw on my left side comes out every few months.  I need to get a replacement screw and some thread lock to put on it. Otherwise it’s great!",Vive
"Great, thanks for the details.
Would like the index but i think for a casual gamer pimping my vive will do it for me.",Vive
Thanks!,Vive
This is really good to hear :),Vive
"I look around, I look around, I see a lot of new faces",Vive
And everyone liked that :D,Vive
We don't go to Ravenholm in VR.,Vive
"""What does this mean for the modding community?

Yeah well, sites like https://bsaber.com/ aren't exactly 100% legal are they",Vive
Hope they keep fixing this game for VR... This game is not cheap.,Vive
Please link where to get this and how to setup. Gonna buy a vive here soon and this is def a top priority game to play when I get it!,Vive
"I really think it's unlikely we're going to get another patch, but we can hope.  I'm having a bit more fun than I thought I would, but I still miss being able to play multiplayer.",Vive
It doesn't specify a 7.5 voltage so I would be sceptical. Buying a 3rd party battery will be a dice roll until someone proclaims success online.,Vive
"Get the Pro, it is glorious",Vive
"I always thought it was strange, but I thought it was kind of a joke - buy the pack and get all current and future Valve games, but Valve doesn't make games anymore, so it was a bit of a gamble.

I guess I must have seen some misinformation. Thanks for the details.",Vive
See if you can find the screw that holds it in. It's a small screw. Easy to repair with a set of jewelers screwdrivers,Vive
I heard there isn't much difference,Vive
F,Vive
My Vive setup has recently changed as I am looking at moving soon and one of my vive lighthouses is just sitting on a shelf thats only 3-4 feet off the ground. my play space is a bit smaller though.,Vive
"Hm.. I dont have much of a clue.. but if you plug them in with a usb cable to your pc, can you update the firmware?",Vive
"I don't think you have the option anymore. They're listed as out of stock on Steam. It only just happened, I bought them like 4 days ago.",Vive
which screw? Do you have picture?,Vive
"This is SUPER helpful, thank you.",Vive
You can by modifying the app manifest.,Vive

Don’t forget late for work,Vive
"They will be back in stock soon, all the index kit keeps going out of stock and has done since release.",Vive
"I had the Vive OG, a friend of mine loved it, bought me that one, so I used that money and bought the Vive Pro. Both are great, but I love my Vive Pro so far.

It is more a matter of money, from those 3 you mentioned, I have to recommend you: Vive Pro.

and btw, welcome to VR, is aaaaamazing to be inside new worlds...including games heheheh
Enjoy getting your mind blown away many times :P",Vive
"OG is too old now, Cosmos tracking is a mess, so it's the pro.    
With that said, I'm not sure you can call it 'bang for your buck'.     

If you're open to other brand, Valve Index is a better value than Vive Pro. The only problem is it doesn't have wireless option right now.",Vive
I was high as fuck and used my friends vive went on Google maps vr. HOLY SHIT that was a trip.,Vive
"Only with Google Maps VR? 

Hhaahha of course is a trip, kuak!! :p

Then about this one?

Elite dangerous is easily readible in my index,Vive
"&gt; You'll also have to buy multiple monitors unnecessarily.

No you don't - just pick one with the most exclusives and buy that, and most people will get along fine like that.

At the very least it's far better than *noone* having any big-budget games (which is more-or-less how things are with SteamVR, WMR, Daydream, and every other platform other than those of Oculus and Sony).

&gt; You're trying to dress exclusivity up as a pro-consumer thing

It's not, in the same way that charging money for software and hardware alike is anti-consumer.

Pro-consumer and anti-consumer aren't particularly helpful labels, since the basic operation of a business requires you to do things that consumers would rather you didn't (like charge money for goods and services).",Vive
"I too played Windlands some almost immediately after getting the Vive, thought if I could get used to that I could handle anything.

While there are still some things that make me sick (I don't think you could ever get used to the headset image freezing on you), they're pretty much only bugs or very poorly implemented controls.",Vive

"Could be. I've been generally frustrated with image quality in my OG Vive. Bought it at launch, have dragged it all over the place, played a ton of it... But it was never something I wanted to spend hours in. Play some Beatsaber, Audioshield, Gorn, Superhot, The Lab, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, Climbey... Anything that's sort of short-jaunts, definitely down. Long-form stuff? Just can't do it for that long, because the image quality always ends up frustrating me with the longer-term QoL stuff.

"Replaying now.  It's a great series.  HL2 aged really well.  The gameplay is top notch with just the right balance between action and puzzle / story.

"get an oculus rift S or a valve index. do not support HTC, they will not support you back.",Vive
I heard that too. Its false. Huge difference in my opinion. I brought my OG Vive to my parents house and was shocked at how low quality it felt now that I'm used to the Pro. Just my 2 cents,Vive
I've been replaying the games but I have no idea if I'll be playing Alyx when it releases as I don't want to play it until I have Index controllers. And those still aren't on sale in Australia.,Vive

I should reword: To enjoy all software you need to buy all headsets. That's akin to having to buy all monitors to enjoy all software available on PC. If the idea of that doesn't disgust you then I'm not sure what else to say.

&gt; At the very least it's far better than *noone* having any big-budget games (which is more-or-less how things are with SteamVR, WMR, Daydream, and every other platform other than those of Oculus and Sony). 

Firstly, some of the highest rated and top selling  games in VR don't have a large budget. That's right, budget doesn't ensure something is good. Secondly, exclusivity and platform lock-in is not a prerequisite for big budget games; see Half-Life: Alyx, Elite Dangerous etc. With that myth dispelled, I'll value a platform that allows software to run across all headsets over one that creates artificial restrictions and feel great that I'm enjoying indie and triple A games alike having not bought into the exclusivity-is-healthy propaganda you seem to have lapped up.",Vive
"I also found this one, so I guess there are (at least) three solutions to look into:

"Hum vive and index have pretty much the same requirements, what is your setup?",Vive
"Index recommends a 1080, where a vive recommends a 970
I've got a gtx 970",Vive
"the minimun requirement for an index is a 970, and that what's is important, because, to make it as simple as possible, index recommend better specs because it can provide a better experience, but if you got the minimum spec, it will scale down to the level of the vive and you will have more or less the same experience as a vive.

It s true for most HMD... aside from the one with lower refresh rate.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the cosmos, the tracking is apaprently bad, and bad tracking = bad experience",Vive
"I have an OG Vive, and it works pretty good. The resolution and frame rate aren't the best out there, but it's still a good headset that will play all the games you probably want to play. The Rift S seems like a good choice too. But if you're willing to dish out the extra cash, the Index is the best headset on the market right now.",Vive
"If you really want a joystick and finger tracking and you're willing to spend the money on that, then yes.",Vive
"Since you only have a gtx 970 I would go for the original Vive if you can get one on a good Black Friday sale.  At least you will get excellent tracking and you will have base stations and controllers that you will be able to use later if you decide you want to upgrade your pc specs and then buy a better headset like a Vive Pro or an Index.

The Cosmos tracking is still very poor so I would avoid it for now.  I have one and it will be collecting a bit of dust while I wait for a Steam module to come out (1st qtr 2020) so I can use my base stations/controllers with it.

The Oculus Quest may also be a good alternative.  The beta pc link looks good but it does not currently support anything less than a gtx1060.  There’s a good possibility that it might support a gtx970 later though.",Vive
"I've done a bit more research and looking at the Index, I'm a bit happier to dig a bit deeper to afford it. Thanks so much for the recommendations :)",Vive
You are welcome :D,Vive

"I think getting an OG vive makes sense IF you can get it used for a good price. I agree with other posters that you could get other headsets that would be better for similar prices, but this way you will get both lighthouses and controllers meaning that you could upgrade to the index very easily at some point. Otherwise, grab an odyssey + for the $229 price to hold you over until you can get an index.",Vive
"Hey there. Thank you for the detailed summary and opinion sharing.

With the lower ceiling in one end of the room it might still be good to not use it as playspace in total due to hitting or jumping danger while in VR. Otherwise you might just try it with the lighthouse little lower hanging and checking it out if it still works ok for you.",Vive

Excited to play Boneworks with them in a few weeks, though.",Vive
I would recommend checking out the Index if you have the cash. I recently upgraded from the OG Vive and it's better in every way. I just upgraded the headset for $500 since it is compatible with the OG lighthouses and controllers. Your 2080 will be able to handle the improvements a bit more than my 1080 as well.,Vive
"Well, I would probably not buy it at that price. I sold my entire kit + the DAS and extension cords for I think $300 over a year ago now. I probably wouldn't get it over $300 at this point, especially with the O+ on sale for $229",Vive

I use the speakers built in with the vive pro?


(Yea I know they suck apparently. But being born with significant hearing loss and having Mineres syndrome means all speakers sound like crap to me. So sound quality isn't an issue for me) 

Otherwise no idea. It's always been an issue.  

But my remotes last for about 5-6hours so I am really fine with changing battery. I just don't know why they don't last",Vive

If somebody is looking for a cheap entry now, chances are he/she won't spend that much money to upgrade anytime soon. 

It's probably unpopular around here, but I really think the Vive is not a good choice anymore. The Rift S is a significantly better experience *right now*, even cheaper and new.",Vive
"Probably.  I was from the first batch of wirelesses. 

Can I ask if yours heats up something fierce? Mine always does. I used to get grey screen a lot (fixed that with a shorter cable however)

I've always been suspect my entire wifi set was off. But returning and renewing it was too much of a headache.

And as I said. Between the anker and that I get all my playtime in. So it's not so bad.

The heat isn't such an issue in winter when my attic is cold but summer I can't even.

I converted my entire attic space into a VR green screened play space",Vive
"This is all so helpful, thank you everyone! I was under the impression that the vive trackers were much more limited in their setup and that one of the selling points of the new Index trackers was that they could be used at variable heights. I just didn't want to get it all set up in my room and drill into the walls and everything just to have it not work. 

I guess I will give the base stations a try in this case. Who knows maybe I could spring for an index HMD if I want an upgraded experience and keep the trackers. I'll let everyone know what happens once I try it out!",Vive
"Thank you so much for all this info! I have to say, I'm still really interested in the quest. Something about just being able to put it on and being in VR does sound magical and so much more accessible than anything else that currently exists. Being able to also use it for PC VR just...increases the value. I know from my experience with the VIve that all the cables and setup and software and everything is prohibitive to just jumping in and enjoying, so maybe despite the slightly lesser hardware, this is the best of all worlds. If I was going to spend $$$ on a new headset, do I go index HMD and get the best of the best? Or Quest and get ultimate flexibility and portability?

Luckily my dad is visiting in a few weeks and he's purchased a quest and become a huge fan (uses it instead of a home gym) so he's going to bring it so I can try it out!",Vive
"I can actually make it most of the way across the room without running into ceiling issues, but if I mounted the lightbox ""right"" there then I probably wouldn't be able to go all the way that far since it's supposed to be pointed towards the middle of the play area (and honestly it would just look weird with a lightbox and cable just dangling right there in the middle of the wall)",Vive

I think those are the only reasonable choices you should make.",Vive
"The vive is worth it if you intend to upgrade to the index headset eventually.

Buying a vive could be considered a downpayment towards the index.

Imo the index is a vive with better resolution screens that give dark greys instead of black (like the vive)

So double the price isnt proportional, but the over all vr experience is very very similar (same with lower res) and maybe a bit more uncomfortable

"Yeah, I have the wireless adapter and index controllers, both fantastic upgrades to the setup.",Vive

Is it an old version of Virtual Desktop?  I know they added streaming for the Quest which interfered with the HTC Wireless adapter... but I think there were changes so that it shouldn't cause problems unless streaming.  But great news that you found the problem!,Vive

I'm just hear to voice my everlasting love for RacketNX.  It's so god damn good.  I highly recommend it.,Vive
"&gt; you're still stuck with the infamous Vive Wands.

Honestly, the vive wands aren't bad at all. I have the index controllers now, but the vive wands are (I would argue) still better than the WMR controllers at this point. 

&gt; but I really think the Vive is not a good choice anymore

I mean, I basically agree. The vive was a great headset when it was made. At this point, it is definitely lagging behind. But as I said, I think the controllers are fine, and more importantly getting the basestations is a big deal. I basically only advocate doing this if you can get it under $300 for the full package. 

&gt; The Rift S is a significantly better experience right now, even cheaper and new.

That's mostly true. The refresh rate being 72 isn't awesome, and if you have any IPD other than the average it's going to be way worse for you. Finally, the tracking is still better on the OG vive vs. the rift s. But, fundamentally I really don't like the idea of supporting oculus and their shitty policies. If you want to do that though, I'd suggest the quest over the rift s now that the link cable has been released. I hate to admit it, but I think the quest is a great headset at a great price point.",Vive

"Yeah, I think that's basically right. There were some tracking things that I didn't love with the Odyssey, but for $229 it's hard to say no to. Fundamentally, I recommend the OG vive only for the controllers and the basestations with the headset just designed to tide the person over until they can upgrade.

"Yup. And the anti-SDE display that they advertise actually works, on top of being the same resolution as the Index.",Vive
yes it should be plug and play.,Vive

Close steam, open the appmanifest 620980 file in ""\SteamLibrary\steamapps"", change the ""StateFlag"" to 4, the ""BytesToDownload"" to 0, and the ""UpdateResult"" to 0. This should make Steam believe that the app is always up to date. And maybe make the file read only.",Vive

I'll give it a shot.",Vive
Some people do not change the config file so might just be able to swap lenses.  Of note is each Vive headset config is different as its calibrated at factory for manufactuting variations in original lenses.,Vive
"Is wireless important to you? If so, Vive is your only option. And lighthouse tracking is still the best system available. Plus it allows you to get into VR for cheap, with the ability to upgrade down the road. 

If money is no object  - then go for it. Just not sure if it's worth twice the price. I have an OG Vive and the Pimax, and while I LOVE the larger FOV &amp; clearer screen that the pimax offers, I still prefer using the wireless Vive.",Vive
"&gt; Rift S' refresh rate is 80Hz and I (as most people) don't notice a difference at all compared to the OG Vive or Rift which might be because the panel is lower persistence.

Fair enough, I didn't notice it either to be fair, but I also don't really notice re projection so I just figured I was a bad test case.  I still think it's going in the wrong direction, whereas the index is pushing it in the right direction but I understand. 

&gt; Why should somebody settle for the okayish Vive Wands when you can have the very good Touch controllers at a lower price point?

Honestly, I know i'm in the minority but I don't think the new touch controllers are all that much nicer than the vive wands. They are better for sure, but I think it comes down to the fact that we have a difference of opinion on the quality of the vive wands. I still find them entirely usable. To answer your question, because the tracking is better, and it is far more easily upgrade-able. And even with all of this, I wouldn't advocate the vive over the rift S if they were the same price. I'm saying to get the vive if you can get it used for under $300. 


&gt; Rift S' tracking is great and it's a better PCVR headset than Quest + Link.

I think the tracking is good. I would not say great. It's good for 90-95% of uses probably. But there are still things that it just doesn't do well at all that the OG vive got right. And it isn't just the behind the back stuff, I had issues aiming down the sights with two controllers in front of each other in pavlov for instance because they were occluding each other from the cameras. 

As to your point about the quest, that's true... but wireless is a HUGE benefit. And it's even better than the wireless on the vive pro where it's still tethered to the computer. You can keep your quest in the trunk of your car and play wherever. IDK, that just seems to me to be such a huge paradigm shift. 
&gt; When I get a give somebody buying advice I leave out all the politics as imo that's a personal choice.

I'm inclined to agree with this except I don't think it's only the politics of it that is the issue. It's that if you buy an oculus headset there is a chance that you will not be able to use your games in the future. I think that's the type of thing that someone should know before buying into the ecosystem.",Vive
Have you tried asking this question in /r/not-in-vive-since-its-a-rift?,Vive
"&gt; It's that if you buy an oculus headset there is a chance that you will not be able to use your games in the future.

This is wrong, no other way to put it. You can get a Rift S and buy **all** your games on Steam if you wish to. Buying on the Oculus Store is a *choice* people have - and choices are never bad.",Vive

for a few seconds? try playing with energy saving settings.,Vive
Could you not just use an HDMI cable for one of your monitors? HDMI 2.0 does support 144hz at 1440p and HDMI 1.4 can do it at 1080p. And I thought the 2080 ti had 3 displayports.,Vive
You have to have that specific WiGig card and no it can’t be purchased new separately from the rest of the set. You might be able get just the card on eBay or something though. Best of luck!,Vive
HDMI 1.4 supports 1080p @ 144hz? I did not know that.,Vive
"Ditto, although mine for only 2.5ish years.",Vive
Too scary bro.  :(,Vive
It can but it depends on the monitor AFAIK.,Vive
No VR support. They are having a hard enough time with their small team finishing Black Mesa. But it should be Xen complete in a couple of weeks. Hopefully.,Vive
Vive is one of the worst headsets on the market in many areas. I'd suggest a Rift S instead if you don't have the money for an Index.,Vive
"Same here, no issues.  You may not be able to install Steam VR to another drive, but Steam makes it easy to move games to another drive, via that game's properties in your Steam Library.  See if you can free up some disk space on C: that way.",Vive
"I picked up a used Vive about 3 months ago for dirt cheap. Add that you can get brand new TPCast setups for Oculus on ebay for practically nothing and it was a no-brainer for me. All in cost was about $300

I am considering upgrading to the index controllers though. My hands fatigue holding the Vive ones compared to the Oculus controllers.",Vive
"I've had the same problem. There are settings in Steam VR that are supposed to automatically switch the audio input/output sources when you start or stop it, but I find that they just don't work most of the time.",Vive

"60ghz band is very weak through wall, even htc said that this band protect interference in appartment building, but if both wireless use different channel and the wall is paper thin, it should work.",Vive
Looking at it now for the first time. That looks really fun!! Also it's on sale which is cool,Vive
"You adjust quicker when playing something unfamiliar imo. But there is definitely a 'getting used to things period', was less than a week for me. Some things I still prefer to play with wands, like RecRoom paintball.",Vive
"If you want wireless (if you have a big area, wireless is awesome) the Vive is perhaps worth it.

For the best Vive experience, you'll want to get the Vive + DAS + wireless + Index Controllers and probably some new padding (the faux leather stuff is nice) which would only be a bit cheaper overall then the full Index kit, depending on cost in your area. This is my setup and I prefer it overall to the Index, but only slightly and only because of the wireless. 

If wireless isn't that important to you, get the Index. If wireless isn't that important to you, and you want to spend significantly less for a somewhat lesser overall experience, get a Rift S or perhaps the Samsung Odyssey+.",Vive
"I would add that the Index HMD is also a pretty big improvement in comfort over everything else I've used, particularly for long sessions. For long story games, like I assume HL: Alyx will be, that upgrade could matter even more than the visuals.",Vive
to me having any amount of eye strain in or after VR is unacceptable. which will happen if you're not in the ideal IPD range for the Rift S.,Vive
"I'm pretty sure it has software correction, just like PSVR, which works absolutely fine unless you're somewhat of an alien.",Vive
"Not for £500 that is far to much to be spending on a Vive. Buy it used if you really want a Vive, as really the only big advantage of getting a Vive over something else is you can upgrade to another SteamVR headset and controls down the road.  But for £500 you better off just spending the £900 for the Index as will be cheaper in the long run and you get the new controllers and Lighthouses, Plus HL:Alyx


If you ok with used I would also look at Vive Pro kits used as well sometime you can find a deal, but it still needs to be significaly cheaper then the Index to make it worth it. 

Also there are other headsets as well
Rift S: good but low refresh rate, and no physical IPD sucks if your IPD isn't average.   
Odyssey+:  Tracking isn't the greatest but it is usable.",Vive
"Slight variations in what? Just in production? I don't have the original config file for my vive anymore, I've been running off of another one and it seams to work just fine without any problems. Having looked at the config file before what is diferent between them?",Vive
Last time I moved it to another library it completely broke SteamVR. I had to move it back.,Vive
Even with the sale they are still over priced compared to other headsets in my opinion.,Vive
"You could bypass the issue completely if you had the wireless adapter. Normally I wouldn't suggest buying more equipment as a ""workaround"" but having wireless capability is something I already highly recommend.",Vive
Nice one.  I know there is a valve complete pack friends and family that they gave away for various reasons which does what you say.  I'm not so sure about the one sold on steam.   It just wouldn't make sense or at least be bigger news for deal hunters,Vive
F,Vive
"Hate to break it to you but most of that telemetry stuff has been back ported to windows 7.

So your going to have to hack it either way.",Vive
"what exactly are you breaking to me here?  you not knowing the difference between a good VR experience and a poor one?

Im about to drop $4k on a new system for VR and i have a 1080TI and a 7700k with 32GB of ram.  Let that sink into your peasant brain for a min.",Vive
"Good point, my statement was incorrect and I agree with your analysis. Given that, you are correct, it is basically the politics of it at that point. By which I mean by supporting Oculus you are supporting their policies that I would argue are bad for VR as a whole. But, if you buy an oculus headset and never buy a game from their store you're not really putting yourself at any risk.",Vive
"I was gonna buy the wireless adapter too, so that bypasses it all completely?",Vive
"If money is no object vive pro, wireless and index controllers is probably the best combo currently at an absurd price though.",Vive
They confirmed this wasn’t happening,Vive
"Even though this is a coming soon preview of a review sample ""article"", it is pertinent now because the Cosmos is $100 off for black friday.   Cosmos had another [beta update yesterday](https://forum.vive.com/topic/6915-cosmos-beta-release-1085/) but as far as I can see the inside out tracking isn't  making big strides.",Vive
If you could pair it with the original vive controllers or index controllers then all is good. Wouldn’t call it viable by any stretch.,Vive
"i've always thought kneepads would make great trackers if you could get the upper and lower knee tracked. First, it makes sense for games with archery or sneaking to drop to one knee every once in a while. Second, with trigonometry you could get the position of the hips and ankle simultaneously, giving you full body tracking without kneeding a tracker on a belt.",Vive
"it is not the same. i couldn't use my friend's rift s after a couple minutes (68mm IPD). just search ""rift s eye strain"" in the search bar and look at the top 5 posts. also a couple below those that mention the strain too",Vive
"&gt;buying the standard HTC Vive (£500)

Does this price include the Deluxe Audio Strap (DAS)?

The OG Vive without DAS can be very uncomfortable and cumbersome to use. Before I got the DAS I hated fumbling around with my headphones and IIRC it was even less comfortable to wear and adjust. That said even with the DAS I still have to deal with either nose or forehead pressure points that sometimes leave uncomfortable red marks on the bridge of my nose due to the hard plastic nose area. I can't wait till I get an Index with a partially padded nose and a proper integrated strap to see if my issues go away.

At the minimum you should probably be making the comparison of buying a HTC Vive + DAS vs. buying an Index. Because the Vive alone isn't a real comparison comfort wise, you are definitely going to want the DAS.

&gt;I understand the Steam Index has better resolution, refresh rate, fov over the Vive

It's not supposed to be just ""better"" in the ""128GB would let me fit more music, but my collection will probably fit fine in 64GB"" way. To my understanding the difference should be ""noticeable"".

I can tell you for certain that the Vive's limitations are noticeable even when you haven't tried any of the modern headsets yet.

Text is difficult to read unless it's right up close to your face. And if you focus just right, you can count the individual pixels used so make up a line and realize how much detail is missing from what you are looking at because there's only 1 pixel available for a detail that needs at least 3+ to be clear.

I've heard people say they can actually read text now at a reasonable distance on many of the new HMDs and I'm dying waiting for that.

The other thing you want to consider is that the Vive is discontinued and you're buying second hand hardware. HTC has terrible customer support and have denied warranty support for a design flaw that resulted in some people's Vives being bricked by sweat. Now it's discontinued and it's unlikely anything you buy will have warranty. If your Vive breaks due to an accident or the aforementioned design flaw, you may end up having to pay half that price just to get it repaired and be without your VR headset for weeks or months. Assuming of course they don't eventually shut down or scale back their repair services for a discontinued product.

That alone might be a good enough reason to buy a set of hardware you can get a RMA on from a customer friendly company.",Vive
"Beat Saber will likely appeal to anyone, gamers and non-gamers alike.

Pistol Whip and Superhot if any of them like shooting stuff.",Vive
"Yes it uses a pcie card which hooks up to a wireless transmitter/receiver (coax barrel type connection), it doesn't use a video card port. If you are thinking of wireless dont think about it, just do it. If you have the cash a Vive Pro and wireless are a fantastic combination. I can't remember the model but a quick Google search will help you find the battery the wireless uses so you can have a spare. I think I got mine from Amazon for around $40 but that price is a guess as I don't remember. Needless to say they work with no issues and I get several hours off one charge.",Vive
 I had in mind that windowsMR people use vive controllers but maybe it is fiddly.   I need to read this carefully https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/86ri8w/vive_controllers_work_with_the_odyssey/,Vive
I'm having a similar issue and narrowed the problem down to the HDMI in the 3 in 1 cable so I'll be replacing that. Not sure if you're experiencing the same thing though.,Vive
Nobody will remember im a year or two,Vive
"Software adjustment will have limitations. The Rift S, shockingly, has only a single display. Proper IPD adjustment moves the two displays.",Vive
Ritchie's Plank Experience is a great starter.,Vive
maybe your angle is off try putting the knob at the closest position,Vive
"Oh, that solves my DisplayPort issue then. Thanks for the info!",Vive
Exactly,Vive
"it will work without any problems. Each vive just seems to have been calibrated to their lenses. 

&amp;#x200B;

Probably they look with a camera into each lens and show a test image, on how the image is distorted tthey can make small sorrections. Because the screen could be missalinged by some margin where it doesnt matter and can be easily be corrected in software. 

But i think you never get the stock lenses back in place exactly how they were placed by the robot in the factory. I mean these corrections are probably in some +-0.5mm window with 0.01mm steps, also rotation of the lenses isnt 100% too when you put them back by hand.",Vive
I thought it had a teleport but it has been awhile. I think it was the option to tell it where to go and then you watch your guy run there in 3rd person and snap to the body when he arrives.,Vive
I thought it had a teleport but it has been awhile. I think it was the option to tell it where to go and then you watch your guy run there in 3rd person and snap to the body when he arrives.,Vive
I just got mine today and I’ve adapted to it.  I prefer the old trackpad for movement however the thumb stick hasn’t been a huge issue and feels relatively comfortable. Your brain just has to rewire a bit.,Vive
"You're welcome, hope it helps.",Vive
I own a lense modded wireless cosmos and it's amazing. If controller occlusion (holding a two handed rifle or bow in front of your face) is a deal breaker don't buy. Although not optimal I find it a minor inconvenience. It's an $1100 investment however. Upgrade your video card before jumping into high resolution PC vr.,Vive
A lot depends on your computer. If you can't take advantage of the index don't get it,Vive
"Because what you said is shit. It's a shitty thing to say. Just because you're dropping $4k on a system doesn't mean you should be shitty to the vast majority of people who have not done that. That's the kind of elitist nonsense that has made people hate the ""PC master race"" morons for years. You don't get that? Sorry for you.",Vive

Also go into your windows settings and turn off windows game mode.",Vive
"Half Life Alyx is not in the complete pack yet. Also, I've bought the complete pack and do not have Alyx in my library. If you own a Valve index/knuckles controller then you get it for free.",Vive

Only if you accepted the updates.  I'm vigilant about which updates I allow my computer to install.,Vive
It really isn't though.,Vive
"$200 for the adapter , and then you'll also need to buy basestations and controllers, because the Cosmos controllers won't work, and now you've already spent more money than an Index which is HTC-level of crazy.",Vive

""According to Valve's own estimates, just over 1% of all the PCs that were surveyed as part of the **Steam** Hardware Survey had **VR** headsets attached. Seeing as **Steam has** 90 million monthly active **users**, that's probably around 1 million headsets ""

They have a waaaay smaller consumer base even though they're the most popular VR game.",Vive

"As far as I know no consumer game utilizes the Eye Tracking of the vive Pro eye. At the moment it’s a business and research solution.

"&gt;Buying a vive could be considered a downpayment towards the index.

How's this?",Vive
"I've heard the sweet spot on the cosmos is pretty small though. I think by the time I spend that much I'd rather get an Index kit. Higher FoV, Refresh Rate, and God tier audio. A bungee system for the cable would be good enough for me. Full wireless is great and all, but I feel like it's way overpriced for what it is.",Vive
"Iirc, you can reuse the base stations, so when it's time for the index, you could buy just the HMD and knuckles, or just the knuckles.",Vive
"I had the same problem, try the different wrist adjustments. I have mine set on the second one from the bottom. There was definitely an adjustment period to get used to them, I was originally disappointed when I got them. All this hype and they don't fit properly?! Play around with the fit, it'll take some time but you should get used to it within a few play sessions.

It's probably the biggest thing I hear when I demo them off to new VR people is that they didn't feel right.",Vive
"The vive headset, wands and lighthouses are interchangeable with the index headset, controllers and lighthouses

So if you buy a used ogvive kit for say ~$350, you could buy the Index headset for $500 and essentially have the index experience minus the controllers... for ~$850


Then you could then buy the index controllers for $280, and have spent ~$1130 for the whole Valve index Experience (lighthouses v1 vs v2 dont offer any performance enhancements) so, you end up paying $130 more, BUT you start playing the instant you get your ogvive.

This is the route i took, i had the Ogvive for 2 years, bought the index headset, so the vive headset is repacked, the wands are still in daily use... but 6 months after getting the index headset i saved enough for the controllers and should arrive by christmas... 

You could also do bad math and consider that each v2 lighthouse is $150 by themselves.. if you bought the used Vive for $350, you effectively paid $50 for a working headset and wands, AND started playing vr immediatelly.

I know this is not how buying things work, but its a way to make sense of the $ you are putting in.",Vive
"
I prefer the Vive over the Rift, or Quest, but that’s just me.  I’m sure I’ll get some downvotes for that. 

I picked up a Vive OG back in May.  Could’ve waited longer and saved for an Index, but I’m one impatient fucker.  Anyway, I’m really glad I pulled the trigger when I did, and to go with the Vive.  Absolutely love it!  Been having a blast playing it, and I can always upgrade to the Index HMD and knuckles, later on.  Just jump in now and start having fun!

As far as all the noise about the SDE on the Vive, the first upgrade I did was to swap out the original lenses, and put in the Samsung Gear lenses, I grabbed off of eBay for like $20.
What a difference!  I’m not saying it’s going to look like the Index headset, but it’s a noticeable improvement, and a cheap one at that.

I also picked up a new TPCast wireless adapter on eBay for $155.  A little pricier upgrade, but at least you have the option to “cut the cord” with the Vive.  To me, the biggest “buzz kill” that can ruin the VR experience, or make it less immersive, is constantly having to deal with the cable wrapping around your legs, and needing to stop play, or pause the game, to untangle it.",Vive

I don't think there's anything free out yet that can do this for you. I have no personal recommendation, but I've heard OVRDrop and OVRToolkit are usually used for this.",Vive
"Yeah, the only way this would have been viable is if the controllers were designed to work with both systems and the Cosmos came with lighthouses and the adapter for the same price they're currently selling it at.   Then it might have made sense.",Vive

For non-gamers I like to start off with Tilt Brush and theBlu.,Vive
"Nope.  I was all ready to buy a Cosmos until the news that the controllers didn't support lighthouse tracking dropped.  So for a wireless OG Vive user, you're looking at the cost of the Cosmos + the the faceplate + additional controllers (unless you want to stick with 2+ year old wands).

l am currently considering buying an Oculus Rift S to play with but l am not quite sure is my computer able to do so or not. it will be a disappointment if my pc explodes when l am playing VR so l am here to question.

"PSA: they gone, sold out, seems only US users can still buy them.",Vive
I'll try this!,Vive
It feels a bit weird how they lay in the hand _correctly_. You will get used to it,Vive
"Currently got a cv1 with a GTX 1060 6gb build, runs all games great, except echo arena for some reason, altho it ran fine before I upgraded my gpu. Big fan of VR, bigger fan of all things HL. 

On the fence about getting the index. I always wanted a higher fov and the knuckles seem awesome, but I can't justify the price point just to play one or two killer games, boneworks and HLA.  I'll still get the games but the index might be further down the road for me, especially since I need another new GPU.",Vive
I believe i read here some time ago someone used a DP to hdmi adapter and it worked but do not quote me.  Either way it sounds like your getting a wireless adapter so you wont have to worry anyway.,Vive
How does HTC make money? They're out of the smartphone game rightM,Vive
"I know Virtual Desktop has a dashboard overlay, but does it do a floating overlay to place into the scene for use while playing any VR games?",Vive
how abt Boneworks,Vive
"You can apparently only buy one at a time and pay shipping for that one.. so it’s not $5 each, more like $13 each",Vive
They are not making money. They have been in the red every quarter for years.,Vive
Acron can be fun with a lot of players (one in VR and up to 8 on mobile phones).,Vive
"None, but you get Alyx with it for free.",Vive
2m x 2m is super small for a house,Vive
Windows 7 will be out of support and security updates as of January.  You may want to consider upgrading.,Vive
"This is great to hear. Valve is taking VR one step forward with these new headsets and controllers. Obviously it's not ""perfect"" VR, but it's still pretty damn awesome for what it is now. 
I just ordered my Knuckles the other day and am stocked to use them. Especially with Boneworks.",Vive
"No I’m waiting a bit to see if it goes on sale at all. The Vibe will probably be a birthday present because his birthday is only a few weeks after Christmas. We have talked about getting one for a while, but didn’t want to spend a ton of money on a new gaming computer just for that",Vive
"i would recommend a rift s then, i had a look and the laptop has a mini display port so it’s all good with the rift s. the rift s is very laptop friendly - no base stations, plug and play. i’ve used a vive extensively (~25 hours) and own a rift s and all i can say is do not get a vive.",Vive
"Yeah, I haven't figured out a plan for January yet.  Not sure if I'm going to dual-boot Linux and Windows 7 (using Linux for browsing the Internet and Win7 for gaming), or if I'm going to use Windows 7 while browsing the Internet exclusively in a virtual machine, or if I can find a copy of Windows 10 LTSB, or if I should just use Windows 7 like normal but back up my data frequently.",Vive
"Is it just that it’s more difficult set up-wise or are there other reasons? I like the idea of not having the base stations, but I like that the vive has easy access to Steam",Vive
ahaha the vive has no easier access to steam than the rift s lol. it’s super finicky a lot of the time too. the rift s can get up and running in a new location in about a minute. maybe 10+ for the vive. plus you get oculus exclusives and don’t have to deal with those cancer ass vive wands and terrible display+optics. the vive is three year old tech and it shows lol,Vive
"Amazing that in the video you link below it shows exactly what I am on about, he cannot move and hold aim with a 2 handed weapon. All he is able to do is turn round, every time he wants to move in any direction he has to stop aiming with any 2 handed weapon.",Vive
"While not being able to move and hold aim with any 2 handed weapon, which is the point.",Vive
"You've got me curious.  What possible situation could tolerate Win7 after it goes end of life, but also requires Enterprise Win10 on the LTSB?",Vive
Can you name any that don’t?,Vive
"Not sure why I got downvoted. The guy got to the top of the leaderboard despite that ""handicap.""

Every locomotion type is a series of trade-offs. The best locomotion is the kind none of us can afford.",Vive
"I'm just a random guy who keeps his tin foil hat on nice and tight.  Windows 10 telemetry, Cortana, and forced updates makes it a nope from me.  If I can block/disable those somehow, then my problem would be solved.",Vive
"I don't have a recommendation in regards to an alternative, but you should check your area libraries and see if they have a 3d printer that you can use. Most times, you just book some time with it and pay for the materials you use. Hope you find something!",Vive
I didn't realize it was completely out of stock...,Vive
"Let’s just say you bought the controllers and that’s it. Would you still get the game? Or do you have to have the headset, lighthouses, AND controllers?",Vive
Have you completed the Room setup as iirc the hmd doesn't display anything until you have completed this?,Vive
Nvm we good had to do a driver update on the nvidia website cuz it wasn’t showing up on GeForce experience. Thanks for the help regardless.,Vive
"I hear *specifically* Windows 10 Professional Edition allows you to disable that stuff, but it's a ""through the grapevine"" rumor you'll have to look into more yourself. I know one thing though, Bigscreen Beta alone got me to upgrade from 7, because it's one of the coolest things VR has right now.",Vive
Did you try updating your lighthouse boxes and controllers and headset via steam vr?,Vive
"I like the way Blade &amp; Sorcery does it, where it's smooth locomotion but if you armswing it makes you sprint. That's more in line with non VR games that people are used to anyway, where you can move and shoot unless you're sprinting.",Vive
You tube videos that could have been a list are the equivalent of work meetings that could have been an email.,Vive
I'm glad this couldn't just be a list,Vive
The last player VR battle royal I think is better. I have both.,Vive
Much better with index compared to OG vive!,Vive
It costs less than them separately.,Vive
"Slim to none, but guess you'll know for sure on Friday.",Vive
there would be a lot of upset ppl who just bought it for alyx :O,Vive
"You get the game with just the controllers, or just the headset.",Vive
"Can't you just get a Visual Studio subscription for $45 for one month, then use the Windows 10 2019 LTSC key you get through that?",Vive
I will look into that! Thank you!,Vive
"I didn't know that was a possibility, but I will now look into that.  Thanks.",Vive
"If you dont mind me asking,why are you so reluctant to upgrade?  I get 7 was a classic (hell it was my XP growing up basically) but 10 isnt that bad an upgrade.",Vive
"HTC needs to make money on the hardware. Valve needs to keep customers buying games from their store. Valve can afford to take a hit on their margins, HTC can not.",Vive
"Telemetry, Cortana, forced updates, Windows Store, ads.  At least they got rid of tiles.",Vive
Please research and you’ll how bad the Cosmos is.,Vive
"That may be true, hadn’t considered that. It sounds like the pro has an OLED screen, though, which I can easily see attributing to the $100 price difference. I’m actually surprised the price difference isn’t greater than it is.",Vive
"Same boat. Index seemed like the way to go over Vive Pro, a real generational leap rather than an incremental upgrade. The announcement of Alyx was what it took to get me to pull the trigger.",Vive
"Thanks dude, you’re the only one to notice! That said, I didn’t even know it was and don’t comment too much as is.",Vive
"Actually it’s pretty standard, people just buy a new one and return the old. Companies don’t bother denying the difference as a refund because it just hurts them more in the long run jumping through the hoops.",Vive
Do you know if the controllers will come back in stock soon?,Vive
Go for oculus headsets they are better deal,Vive
"No idea sorry. I’m waiting for them to come into stock for the first time in Australia, hopefully before the HL:A bundle deal ends.",Vive
"It's not overrated, but it's definitely too expensive, especially for something that only works with one HMD.",Vive
Yes they are all up to date.,Vive
"Then im out of options.
If i find out something i will tell you mate.
A vr mate is never alone",Vive
Agreed,Vive
"Honestly I had the exact same issue playing expert+ in Beat Saber. It was always the controller in my right hand (I tried swapping them), it happened in 2 different houses, I swapped the two lighthouses, I even opened up the controllers to check and see if the sensor ribbon came out. 

Eventually I gave up and bought an index. With the same base stations and positioning but with the index controllers instead, I don't have the issue. Sorry if that's not helpful but this drove me nuts and I couldn't fix it.",Vive
"1.0 base stations and controllers are only $100 more than the HMD by itself, though. Weird pricing but the Starter Kit is arguably competitive with the Index full package at this price.",Vive
"Thank you very much. :) My last resort is Vibe support since they know me very well from the first incident. (Basically the Support staff told me, that if this happens again and they cant solve it i will get a completely new vive and if that happens i will use that to upgrade to a vive pro with a 700 bucks discount)",Vive
Wish you best luck lul,Vive
Because they have to make money on the hardware. The dont have a store printing money like Steam/Oculus,Vive
bruh are you retarded?,Vive
You can buy mine if you want a barely used kit.,Vive
I'd actually be quite interested in that.,Vive
"Ok then I will consider the Rift S. I had thought you had to use some weird software to get it to work with Steam VR, but maybe that was a long time ago or a different headset I’m confusing it with",Vive
Your not the only one!,Vive
yeah would’ve been a long time ago. just don’t buy a vive they’re discontinued for a reason ahhaha,Vive
"You banged the controller against anything? Even by accident? Those controller have ribbon cables attached to the sensors, which get knocked out of place really easily.

Another possibility is that your cameras are too far apart, set up at a wrong angle, or a mix of the two. 

Thirdly, it could be the software itself. Have you updated the controller, or steamvr recently? Steam had to release a patch because beatsaber players were shattering records for how fast the human wrist can move, and thus the software would lose tracking.",Vive
"If you want to play every game, then yes - that's how it's always worked.

Otherwise, just factor that in when buying hardware, like how it works on everything else - if you want to get an XBox that's fine, but don't complain Zelda doesn't run on it.",Vive
"I use them with OpenVR-WalkInPlace to track my feet to make many games act like I’m walking. SkyRim and Fallout VR are the main games I use and they are very immersive.

The issue is almost no games have native support, and even those that do, it’s not supported well.

For games with guns, tennis rackets, paddles, etc. the regular controllers are just as good with add on mods, that using the trackers are more of a hassle, and don’t even support all features that even the vive controllers have.

So, if you want to walk in VR and don’t mind modding, then I highly recommend them.

There is Natural Locomotion on steam that supports them, but I haven’t used it since I use OpenVR WIP.",Vive
"I have both and have yet to pick back up the Pro except for random testing. The overall package is just so much nicer on the Index. Wireless is nice, but there aren't as many games that benefit from wireless as much as the benefits from the Index.",Vive
"The TPcast exists for the rift too. And at ~250€ it's not, like, forbidingly expensive.",Vive
I’ve read that there are performance/crashing issues playing SteamVR games on the Rift S.  Is this common on the well known titles or is this just a problem with the tons of smaller games?,Vive
never had that haha,Vive
"You're missing the point, these adapters only work on ONE HMD. It doesn't matter if there's another adaptor that does the same thing for a different headset.

For $250 you can get a brand new HMD, Like the Samsung Odyssey+. it is a lot more to spend on an accessory that will be forever locked to one specific HMD.",Vive
That's a really really good idea.,Vive
Well ... you pay more a lot for a new headset with the exact same tracking capacity and which basically only amounts to a headset-locked rise in resolution. So I'm not sure I get your logic here.,Vive
Vrchat,Vive
"Last I checked Kijiji had a used Vive for 450 CAD near me. Look into what your city tends to use for in person swaps and sales. Facebook marketplace, craigslist, kijiji, etc could have cheap listings a drive away",Vive
Not yet. I personally don't favor wireless anyway ... I am totally fine using a cable.,Vive
"""Black Hat Cooperative is specifically built to be one in VR and one in 2d on the couch or I think online but not sure.

The person in VR breaking in with the 2D person giving him direction and hacking traps/doors/robots and things. ... haven't played it in a while and we only stopped because it gets really hard and we weren't great at it. Fun though.""",Vive
"Hey man, at least you have the ability to buy them. Australia’s our here being clumped with China. It’s kind of disgusting. If Japan can get them we can. But, according to Valve. Nnnnnno.",Vive
Yeah man I just can't get enough of buying more platforms with software restricted for no reason other than to make you buy into their ecosystem trap.,Vive
It's so bad this user accidentally a word,Vive
Theres a nice tool for that: w10privacy. That + firewall will make things better. Although the HTC vive also is compatible with Linux. You just need to run some games trough proton.,Vive
"I'm definitly going to give it a shot but I don't have high Hopes since the whole, not actually a specific controller thing",Vive
"There are far more benefits than just a bump in resolution. 

Yes, features are specific to each HMD, but you don't have to pay EXTRA for each of those.",Vive
"Thanks, I will keep looking. I thought there might be a retail shop that demos it somewhere but I can't find anything on google",Vive
"I have one, I used it in Island 359 to make the body tracking better, several would add kicking to the game... but I really never felt like breaking a toe in VR.

I'm hoping I can zip-tie it to a crowbar come march.",Vive
"Considering that software generally wouldn't be made otherwise, I do think it's the best way to get VR to everyone.

Should this turn into a full-blown exclusives war, think of how much money Oculus and Valve would be spending on games and advertising, and how many games would come out of it.",Vive
The Cosmos has the best SDE.,Vive
War Dust always has people but even the bots are pretty good too.,Vive
"That's a good start, but honestly, Cosmos is not worth more than $500. That is, if they'll manage to bring tracking to Rift S level. Otherwise they'll be competing with Index (once they'll start selling Lighthouse add on) and I have no idea how that will work out for them, since Index is obviously much, much better with its 120/144 hz and wider FOV at lower price for the whole setup.

Honestly HTC strategy for Cosmos is a mystery to me.",Vive
To think this had to come from a Reddit comment,Vive
"Valve are taking the right approach. They've created a platform that lets developers write software targeting almost any HMD. They're releasing a high quality game that isn't exclusive and leaving development up to everyone else. Such a system helps VR greatly in general.

I could use the same argument you did for selling monitors, which are also displays you attach to PCs. Let's make games exclusive to monitor brands. We can have a monitor brand game-exclusivity war. There's no technical need for this but lets just do it anyway because we'll see the various monitor manufacturers pump money into exclusive games. It's no different to your reasoning and would be horrific. Now consider that they're doing this to a very delicate market in it's early stages. It's just damaging and selfish.",Vive
"They don't have to, but so far every EU store I contacted has honored a deal to return the price difference to save me the hassle of returning the product and buying the discounted one. (Assuming it's still within the refund period of course)",Vive
This isn't the first time I've seen LIV footage from Pistol Whip where the gun is totally mismatched with the hands. Any idea why that is happening?,Vive
"Thx for your feedback.

It's definitely not the intention to release a polished game.  
It's more to sit together with some friends and developed for 5 days a game and experience it in VR.  
Also to test out ""non common"" possibilities, like make a nerf gun trackable with a Vive tracker and embed the nerf gun with the correct physical dimensions in the game.  
Yes you are right, next to see the correct location of the avatar and the nerf gun of the other player there is no more advantage to play in the large area. We wanted to include some body tracking with the kinect, but we ran out of time.  
Nevertheless is was a lot of fun to develop an own created game and ""feel"" the results in VR, although the gameplay is simple :)",Vive
"You are correct, thanks for the note",Vive
"God dammit guys, you have me now looking at selling my Vive and upgrading to index!  Thanks for the info.",Vive
They had shadows in the first videos though,Vive
You should give gaming on Linux a try. For me it's working great since Steam has proton. Check the proton db to see if your games work.,Vive
This game idea sounds great - that's exactly what I'm looking for. Definitely will check that out.,Vive
"cortana is dead, windows discontinued the service, forced updates are non existant, you can chose if you want to update and when, you dont have to use the windows store , and ive never seen ads forced on me by windows.",Vive
"Yeah...I'm not sure. Mine was pretty bad, but my avatar wasn't very well made, so it probably made it worse...but yeah, I noticed it a little bit in other vids, too.",Vive
"It is pretty decent on paper but it seems the QA didn't really do its job... Lots of bugs to fix and lots of updates needed. I haven't been keeping track but I was interested too especially the ability to eventually unlock all it's features - all in one, wireless with the adapter, and light house tracking.",Vive
"&gt; I could use the same argument you did for selling monitors, which are also displays you attach to PCs. Let's make games exclusive to monitor brands. We can have a monitor brand game-exclusivity war.

Awesome, if monitor vendors want to burn half a billion dollars making games, that'd be awesome.

Sooner or later if my monitor vendor is competing they're going to make a bunch of great games, and there will be some more games that I can play that otherwise wouldn't exist.",Vive
"Elite Dangerous. Most Commanders aren’t using VR, but the Elite Dangerous in open mode, in certain systems is very active. However, with 400 billion stars to visit, it can be months between encounters if you go Exploring, which is just gorgeous in VR. If you are into combat, Elite in VR is just amazing. Watch Up is Not Jump’s Elite VR review - all the way to the end. It’s pretty fair.",Vive
"As you already know 'keep taking' I cannot recommend 'Mass Exodus' enough. One player (Headset) is the massive overseer robot that tries to suss out the pancake player  (same PC) who is one of hundreds of identical NPC drones. A defect who is attempting to shut down the overseer. Both have tools for this, and I recommend setting them to regenerate at a similar pace, so both can react to the others use of a special ability. (We usually run skills 1+2 on about 30-45sec regenerate and skills 3 between 50-60s for 2 players).     
It's versus, but tremendous fun. Up to 4 rogues over LAN or internet.",Vive

"The Index or Knuckles Controllers rly wont need a discount. They are not that expensive compared to others. 
I also agree the Half life package ist a Discount.",Vive

"&gt;I'm going to use Windows 7 while browsing the Internet exclusively in a virtual machine,

I don't believe that's going to properly protect you. In order for a VM to connect to the internet generally the host (Win 7 in this case) needs to be connected to the internet. You are partially protecting yourself from viruses/malware that come in through the browser route. But the host is still vulnerable to things that come in by probing the network and taking advantage of unpatched security vulnerabilities in the network stack. i.e. you're still vulnerable if a new worm like WannaCry comes around. And because it's the host that is infected, the virtual hard drive the ""safe"" VM runs in will be vulnerable to any ransomware running on the Win 7 host.

You'll definitely want to either dual-boot or put the insecure OS inside the VM instead of making it the host.

[Anyone tested KAT loco yet?](/r/Vive/comments/e1ylfn/anyone_tested_kat_loco_yet/) by  NeoID


I currently own a OG wireless Vive and love it, but I'm seriously prone to motion sickness so I have a hard time to play games that do not support teleport.

While browsing around on steam I suddenly found this gem: https://store.steampowered.com/app/798810/Natural_Locomotion/

I have tried it at it seems to work really well and helps tremendously with delaying my motion sickness (feet mode). Even though it supports the joycons (which I happen to own), using a phone as the third device wasn't working that well. I was planning on maybe investing in three vive trackers, but they are quite expensive...

Then I suddenly saw an ad on Facebook for KatVR Loco: https://katvr.com/products/kat-loco
These seems almost perfect; Small, half the price of three vive trackers and easy to use. However, I can't find any reviews on these, but I know they had a successful kickstarter campaign and wonder if anyone here has tested them?

I'm also a bit sceptical about the 1.5-2m range they claim in the manual.. does sound like a bit too limiting. My last concern is how this will compare with Natural Locomotion in terms of compatibility and support.

sure no problem.  you can try the pimax 5k as well  :),Vive
I have a normal vive with an amd 1700x and a rtx 2060 with the wireless and it works great. No issues here but i can never go back to the wired not anymore. So until the index has wireless looks like i am stuck with it.,Vive
"That’s good to hear, but I’m hearing a lot of issues with the vive pro side of things. Might hold off on it for now",Vive
Nice slippers! I brought fanny packs back into style with my SO's Victory Secret's fanny pack to hold the battery. Highly recommend!,Vive
"The forest is the only vr game I've played that made me feel a bit queasy, not sure if that was anxiety caused by lunatic cannibals or something with the vr implementation though. Payday 2 vr is solid",Vive
thank you very much!,Vive

"Well yes, it was released long before the index controllers existed :)",Vive
How does it compare to Doom: VFR? I have that but haven't tried it yet,Vive
"&gt; Do Index Controllers work with this?

Worst case scenario you just have to use the legacy steamvr bindings for the index controller.

"Im sure they work, but don't expect it to utilize the finger control.",Vive

Doom 3 VR is literally just a mod for Doom 3 and RoE. You play through the whole game using your VR controls, and it works terrifyingly and satisfyingly well.",Vive

"Yes, works wonderfully with Vive controls.",Vive
Lol ok bud whatever makes you feel better about yourself,Vive
"Highly recommend the Anker as suggested

My HTC official battery lasts. Tops. 1hour

My Anker can last 2-3 hours

Or if you're a girl..shoving the battery in your bra also works.",Vive
"On top of this you can play through all of the original dooms in VR as well.

Also, Alien Isolation!",Vive
"Alien Isolation was a let down in VR for me. AI is one of my all time favorite games, but MotherVR not allowing the use of motion controllers really disappointed me.",Vive
I would love that link as well.  I had it working with keyboard and mouse over a year ago but I'd like to re-visit this and I'd be starting from scratch. Thanks in advance.,Vive

I'm encouraging you to (swoosh) just do it.",Vive
Blade and Sorcery. Kicking NPCs is awesome.,Vive
Can anyone clarify why they dont have shadows? I asked on Youtube but noone can answer,Vive
It's through G-Mod since that has a rudimentary VR mod.,Vive
I used to think Canada got screwed on a lot of things but you guys really do :/,Vive
no you cant those features have been removed dont give people false impressions the only thing that is functional now is a bastardized version via garys mod that just loads the assets and the maps,Vive
"WMR controllers? I tried doing this before and feel like it wasn't a great experience, but I think I had it set up poorly.",Vive
"Never tried WMR. In fact, I've never even seen a video of WMR. I need to go look that up, come to think of it.",Vive
Nonsense I have a Vive Pro wireless and runs great,Vive
"Just saw the deals on HTC's site for this weekend.  Refurb OG Vive for 350, should I go for it?",Vive
Windows Mixed Reality. I've got the Samsung Odyssey+,Vive
I absolutely have to play HL2 again in vr,Vive
"Wow, the guy literally made the mod himself in his spare time and you call it a let down. It's broken for sure but far from a let down. Besides he's busy now making VR mods for Halo",Vive
"You can actually change the perspective to 3rd Person or 1st person for the non-vr player, although that really only works if there is just one person with a controller. It makes the wonky controls slightly easier to use, in my opinion.",Vive
I have 3 but I don’t use them very often.  It is kind of a pain to set them up and there aren’t many games that support them right now.,Vive
Omg... it works for b&amp;s?????,Vive
Understood. I figured,Vive
Wow thanks. Thats more than i thought,Vive
Yes it's janky but I'd rather janky HL2 VR then pancake HL2 VR at this point.,Vive
There’s also a free VR version of Wolfenstein 3D you can play.,Vive
It might also help to hold the Vive on your face in the correct position with one hand and THEN pull the strap over your head instead of pulling it straight down on your head.  I then just tighten the back knob since the top strap is already the right length.  This should help having to adjust it after you put it on.,Vive
Headmaster is my favourite.,Vive
It's actually the game I've played the least on the list,Vive

Keep them incase you have to rma the index controllers I have had to rma the controllers twice already since I play in the vrmasterleague but if your not very competitive then I suppose guy o ahead and sell them,Vive
Neat! I'd be interested to see which you prefer.,Vive

"Good indeed, but speaks volumes of their lack of commitment to quality. We already know they have non-existent customer support, so any product from them is a buy-at-your-own-risk venture.",Vive
Is this the mod where the entire body of the Marine is rendered?,Vive
It definitely was working well for me when I played it with wmr.  I did have to do some tweaking to change movement from touch to joystick as that felt far better.,Vive
"OK i guess i didnt play through the whole game over two weeks then, finishing on Sunday. Yes, I played through Garry's mod ,and yes, the entire HL2 Base campaign works - all scripted sequences etc. There are a lot of bugs, but I've already figured out the workarounds. 

The only major problem is that if you die, you have to reset at the beginning of that level - no saves. Not really a big problem because (with one exception) all the levels are relatively short. You will spawn with one extra clip for every weapon you would have found by that point, but no weapons you shouldn't have. 

If you never died, and had the time, you could play seamlessly through the entire game. That's not super realistic though, and (other than the fact that there is a lot of manual processes) reloading the level when you die is not a problem that should stop anyone.

Oh, and the reward for putting up with all the jank is only the best overall VR experience you can possibly have that is currently available, more or less.",Vive
"What is the appeal of a vlog anyway? If you wanted the info, text posts are easier to parse. If you want someone to read it to you, you want a podcast or screen reader. What does the video add?",Vive
"I'm not saying it was pleasant, but you do get a bit desensitized. I think theres two ways to play though - 'roleplaying', in which you approach everything cautiously as if yo uwere really there, and 'rambo' in which you just tear through everything, sprinting and run'n'gunning.

If you take the rambo approach, theres not much that will ever scare you. But honestly, isn't being terrified the point? I took the role player approach, and I was probably only scared shitless maybe less than 10 times throughout the whole game. Meanwhile...got the drop on a lot of black headcrabs by being cautious, checking corners, and being ready. lol.",Vive
I actually dont recall. I dont think the torso is rendered.,Vive

I couldn't find a third party battery with qc3 and 21 watt output for the cosmos so I bought 2 extra oe batteries from htc. I would like to find one however. I paid 50$ each which is fair for a proprietary battery. I would also like to find an hmd mounted battery holder for complete freedom.",Vive
"I havent played since reborn, but I had well over 200 hours in the first version.  I had a great time play it.  I am not a power level or in a rush to hit max level so all the side things to do kept me well entertained.",Vive

Yes Please!,Vive
It shows the whole body. It is an option you can enable or disable.,Vive
It is an option that can be enabled or disabled.,Vive
Only the pro and enterprise versions.,Vive
Long cable never worked for me with wireless adapter for me so I wouldn't go by that.  CPU is very important.  Also placement of PC antenna.,Vive
"I have that exact combination, I had to update my bios and put my pcie slot into Gen 3, it works flawlessly",Vive
"If you could that'd be great. There was a method for it a while back but Valve patched it, and then people found a complicated work around which was a hit or miss whether it worked or not (I didn’t have any luck despite several attempts).  
  
So if there's now a guaranteed way to do it I'd definitely give it a go!",Vive

Based on the trailer, there is potential for both of those to be seroiusly amped up and I think it's going to cause many a shitted pant.",Vive
"Ah OK thanks, that's more info to go on.",Vive
I don't get it - what's wrong with Mother VR? It's perfect.,Vive
Then why even buy on the HTC store? Just get it from a reseller...,Vive
Ouch. That adds up,Vive
Hail to the king baby,Vive
"Since its amazon, easy return if any problems.",Vive
That sounds great. I am completely fine with vr until skyrim and fallout. I find motion bad and the blurriness since they werent originally built for vr. Unless im doing something wrong and thats why it is blurry. Motion on hotdogs horseshoes and handgrenades i am great with.,Vive

I wanna play through HL before HL:A comes out. Do I need to play HL1 to appreciate HL2?,Vive
!remindme 3 days,Vive
Idk how you guys burn through batteries like that. My regular HTC one lasts about 3 hours on one charge and my Anker one lasts like at least 6. I almost never use the Anker one anymore because it's so heavy and 3 hours is usually a long enough session for me (I most play in the evenings after working all day).,Vive
"I've purchased ""Like New"" pelican cases off Amazon Warehouse before and it is as you say usually just damaged packaging.

However, I've never purchased used tech off Amazon Warehouse. I guess I am just worried about people buying and swapping damaged or sweat damaged headsets and then returning them back to Amazon. 

Curious as to their testing or QC process is for ""Used"" products such as these.",Vive
"honestly, no. unfortunately i think the best way to play HL1 right now is on Quest, supposedly a good PC mod is in the works and might have a release soon, and also the same method that works for HL2 might work for HL:Source though. 

HL1 is great in its own way though.",Vive

"Couldnt find my old reddit account pls dont target me as a guy trying to advertise this game. 

Just want to have players with me to try it xD",Vive

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077CZ8412

It's slimmer, about the size/shape of a smart phone so it slips easily in your front or back pocket, and it's got approximately the same battery life as the original one.",Vive
"Hey everyone, I just got the wireless add on for my Vive Pro, and I love it, but the power bank doesn’t last as long as I’d like. I thought about ordering a couple of extra power banks from Vive, but they don’t seem to sell them to Australia on their own? They seem to sell power banks to America and Canada, but not anywhere else.

I also tried some recommendations from people online, but all the links to power banks on Amazon also don’t ship to Australia. Are there any power banks available in Australia that are compatible with the Vive Pro wireless?",Vive
"If so, I really hope they include Google Earth VR-style controls.",Vive
"Do you mean this gmod setup? It has a lot of bugs, I couldn't play through with it",Vive
"If you do, can you make it an idiot proof guide? I’m ask for, uh, a friend.",Vive

"What’s the index headset? Isn’t that another headset, is it any better than the pro?",Vive
"It is another headset but it works with the Vive 1 trackers and wands, so if you own a vive it’s a simple swap out and currently the best headset on the market. Made by valve.


If you have wireless already the vive Pro has better blacks than the index and similar screens but lower refresh rate and FOV.

Yes the index controllers work with V1 base stations.


In my opinion, I prefer the pro with wireless, better colors and blacks, minimal SDE, and the wireless is a game changer.

"I mean full-fledged GEVR navigation as an option for VR, like how the old Flight Simulators had a ""slew"" mode where you could move the plane/camera around in any direction at will. I love the world model they've designed, but it would suck to only be able to view it from the context of a flight sim. I'd love to be able to explore without having to worry about keeping a virtual plane in the air.",Vive
"You can find tutorials online, you basically copy a large chunk of text and paste it into a notepad file that’s stored on your computer, it adjusts distortion of the new lenses. It sounds daunting but it’s really easy..

"I was putting off trying payday in VR because it's such a big game with skill trees, perk cards, loads of weapons... but it's really well done. One of the best VR adaptations of a game imo. It's pretty awesome.

Teleporting instead of fluid locomotion just makes no sense in a doom game.,Vive
There was an update adding free motion a long time ago. Teleport is still there as a mechanic but I played the whole thing with free locomotion.,Vive
"Why should it be my responsibility where I buy ? They selling a product and the terms and condition states refunds within 7-10 days. I think you want to  direct that question to htc, why sell on HTC store  if you're going to be so ¥£€+ . Sell only to resellers . Anyway the point i was making  wasnt about sales , it's about support and customer service. Even if you buy from reseller you still have to go to htc for support no ?",Vive
"Well yes, but then the reseller is responsible for the refund, and they mostly do a better job than HTC (At least in Switzerland its that way...)",Vive
"I'll never understand the audio argument, I think it's silly. 

Most people I know that own VR headsets (higher end ones like an Index or Pro) also, prior to owning said headsets, obviously have a high end gaming PC. 

And 90%+ of people with a high end gaming PC tend to own a very expensive full-ear headset/mic combo. 

So at that point, who the hell cares about the audio? My corsair headset was $160 years ago and it blows any stock VR stuff out of the water, and is more comfortable too.",Vive
"I know this is an old post, but I was wondering if you got the wireless adapter to work on your Aorua Master? I have an Aorus Ultra/3600X and was about to pickup the same adapter for my Vive, just wanted to make sure it would work with it before pulling the trigger.",Vive

Amazon only charges shipping if you say something like you bought the item by mistake.",Vive
"Graphics settings have nothing to do with it because the adapter sends the same resolution video no matter what your settings are.

Play space shouldn't really make a difference either, it's just coordinates being sent.",Vive
"oh shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, ok now I'll buy it.",Vive
"ive got perfect advice/workarounds for the controls. gotta be honest i dont know what you mean by 'container with alien' - but it sounds like a control issue. the trick to activating things/doors/etc is that the 'activation point' is at the tip of your gun - so point your gun about 6 inches/a foot away from somehting and 'use' and it will always work.

There are some weapons where the activation point becomes your HMD instead (grenades, empty hands) but most of the time, its the tip of the gun in your right hand.",Vive

But if you have not enough room for this setup the rift s is not a bad option here because of its price tag and not really bad build quality.

For me precision is more important and thats why i have bought a vive over a rift s.",Vive

"Almost by accident, I discovered and overcame VR motion sickness in my first 5 days with the Vive.

One of the first things I tried after The Lab was Windlands. I started moving forward in that game with controller locomotion and nearly fell flat on my face. I only lasted 20 minutes before I had to have a bit of a lie down.

But the next day I got back into VR and tried a few other things, but still I really wanted to try Windlands again. The next time I did I got about an hour out of it. I was determined not to turn on any of the aids the game provides, because I felt it was getting better.

By day 5 I played through the rest of the first island and just spent hours swinging around and grinning like a moron, poking in every hidden area I could find, haven't had a single problem with VR motion sickness since.

It's your inner ear playing tricks on you that's all and you can keep your sense of balance separate from what your eyes are seeing with a little training, but build up to it, we already know different people experience different levels of motion sickness.",Vive

The human NPCs even looked really intimidating.,Vive
Is there a teleport mode? Movement makes me puke,Vive
"Yes it was easy. There's a slight ledge at the flat part of the lenses that's not easy to see  but once you see it you can slip the edge of a knife in between the lens and bezel and lift up to overcome the mild glue they use. Before you put the new lense in look at the lcd for dust specs( they're easy to see)  and blow that spot with canned air. Don't underestimate having the canned air handy. I did and had to wait 3 days and take the lenses back out to blow the specs away. Definitely worth the trouble. Clear lenses edge to edge.
To get to 21 Watts for the cosmos the battery output would need to be at least 2.8 amps at 7.5 volts. The highest I've seen for 7.5 volt battery is 2.4 amps which will not power it.

Yes they will remove the cosmos attachment from the box but I doubt they will lower the price of the battery. You can buy the cosmos attachment kit with 21 watt battery for 50$.",Vive
"The vive tracker requirements are more guidelines than actual rules.   For example, I have mine a good five feet further apart than is required.  You can definitely mount one at four feet off the ground, just make sure it's angled so it can see upwards a bit.",Vive

"No, sorry :/",Vive
I literally just bought this game this week and fell in love with it.  This hurts.,Vive
"&gt;the vast majority will end up getting the game for free

Wasn't that the point of the pack? To get all of the Valve games; past, present, and future?

I'm not arguing that it should be in - I was just under the impression that the pack was to contain all Valve games. Please correct me if I misunderstood that.",Vive
"This was one of the first games I had my girlfriend try in VR. She got so scared when the first zombie came towards her that she ran into the wall. 

She hasn't tried it since and won't try any other scary/zombie themed games haha",Vive
"That was not the point of the pack.  Like all publisher packs, it was to get the catalog of games made by them up to that point.  All the games you get are listed.  I don’t think anyone thought you’d get all future games.  How would a business make money giving out lifetime subscriptions to their products for less money than the total present collection?",Vive
"So, first, I'm a huge Quest person so keep that in mind when reading this.  I have an OG Rift, PSVR, and Quest, and I basically only use my Quest at this point.

The Quest as a standalone VR device is unmatched and a bit magical.  You strap on the controllers, place it on your head, and you're in VR (or just one step away if you are in a room you don't normally play in; you just have to draw out your boundaries or set it to standing).  It actually remembers multiple rooms too so if you set up to play in one part of the house, and then another, it will allow you to switch between the two easily.  When you step out of your boundaries, your vision switches from VR to the passthrough video view.  You can also disable guardian completely and play in an unlimited size space if you have some space appropriate for that, but you can play basically anywhere that you can stand up and reach out with your arms and spin without touching anything.  It's got mic and multiplayer and 6dof and ports of many great PCVR games.

Tracking on the unit is [great](https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/dynrxs/testing_out_the_link_beta_and_liv_mr_seems_to_be/) but it's not going to match the fidelity of your Vive tracking in the center of your space.  But the only occlusion problems the Quest have are when your hands are very low or behind you; you never lose tracking accuracy as you move to the edge of your space, at any orientation.  It is sensitive to bright sunlight though, and can't be used in the dark.  What I mean by sunlight: if you have a big bay window and the sun is casting into it onto the carpet, super brightly, you are going to have trouble with hand tracking when the controllers are in front of that light, as they have little leds that can't compete with the sun.  It can't be used outside in bright sunlight but on cloudy days it works just fine, and works well if you have overhead cover in a large area.  Regarding dark, just a single light in your room is enough; it's not very picky.  But daytime indoors away from window is most optimal.

Now, for the Link portion.  Compared to Vive, you are going to notice a resolution bump.  You *may* notice compression artifacts when playing some games but you *are* going to notice the lag; there's about 2-3 frames between when I move my hand and I see my avatar hand move, about 1-2 frames between me moving my head horizontally and the world moving, and no percieved lag for head rotation (It's handled using asynchronous time warp which is similar to first-gen Vive reprojection).

It's also not quite done yet, so keep that in mind as I continue here.  Right now, it's not always perfectly easy like plug-it-in-and-it-works.  Sometimes I plug it in and it doesn't care.  And I have to restart it and then it works.  Sometimes I can just replug it again and it works.  Sometimes, when you are playing a game, it may disconnect or restart, or the link service may crash.

But when it's working, other than the aformentioned lag and the wire, it looks and plays very well.  And Oculus has had a good software track record regarding improving things over time.

That all said; I use Virtual Desktop to stream wirelessly more than I use Link.  It has a little more lag and a lot more compression artifacts (At least for me; I can't run slicing on my GPU properly which would help with that) but I still use it more because I can just play it wherever in my house, and I can spin and spin and spin and never pull my computer off my desk.

If what you were really looking for was the Cosmos, the Rift S may be what you actually want now.  The only real bad thing I have to say about it is I don't like that it has no IPD adjustment, and it's enough of a factor for me (71 IPD) that I don't really like using it.  But it's a really good PCVR system otherwise, has a similar tracking system to Quest and the same controllers, and it's got a good price.  It's going to be better for PCVR games in most respects than the Quest, other than portability and the wire in the case of Virtual Desktop.

So if you are still here after this wall of text:

**tl;dr** I recommend Quest if you think you can get something out of it's portability or playspace size capabilities.  If you don't think you, the Rift S is another affordable option if you have an average IPD.  Valve Index is great as a system but honestly the tracking system isn't all that much different than Vive and your room is still going to be non-optimal for it, but I have the least experience with Valve Index so please use other folks for index opinions.

If you have further questions I'd be happy to gab more; I kindof typed more than I wanted to and it's a bit of a shotgun pattern.",Vive
"Thanks again for all of the help and explanation. It's incredibly helpful and I look forward to swapping the lenses. 

I may have found a battery pack but I could also be misunderstanding the specs:

"If you're enjoying this I highly recommend Compound. Modern VR with an 8-bit style and procedurally generated levels. If you've got the knuckles controllers it's even better because of how finger tracking is implemented for gripping weapons. Just let go and you drop the weapon - even had a really cool moment of throwing my weapon from one hand to the other quickly mid-combat that made me feel like an action hero.

Anyway, enough singing its praises - it's great and it's well worth a look for anyone that likes an old-school FPS with old-school sensibilities.",Vive
"Yeah I have, it says that they are connected and tracking everywhere except the tracker manager, I can even see them being tracked in game by opening the steamvr menu",Vive
"&gt; Sensor thing is on monitor,

Move the sensor up as high as the wire will go so it faces down to your playspace, the setup info for the wireless states that you really want 5ft between the wireless sensor and your playspace, so you don't want it too close.

Also as it's only with your head movement....**Change the lead from the Battery**. The std supplied cable is known for giving issues.",Vive
"I enabled it, thanks to everyone here for helping me. Now I won't have to redo steam setup every single time!",Vive
"UPDATE... It seems disabling the Virtual Desktop service has solved it :) Although VD does not start with Windows, it still seems to run a service. Now it all works perfectly.

Very excited for my 2.0 base stations for living room and Index controllers now.",Vive
"The negative reviews for the Rift S are usually about the tracking being slightly worse than the previous rift, which inside out tracking will be, but its still very good so don't worry about it. The Rift S overall seems like it will be a better solution for you than a Vive with its base stations. However, before buying a Rift S, I would personally wait maybe an extra month just to see how the quest link cable situation turns out. 

If you are unaware, the quest link cable is a beta feature that allows the normally weaker stand-alone quest headset to be connected to a pc and run the higher end more intensive pcvr games. While there are obvious drawbacks at the moment, including controller latency and slight compression around your outer fov, comments from the developers hint that the quest is not running at peak performance and the final release of the link cable may be able to bring a near 1:1 vr experience compared with tethered headsets.

Meaning with the quest you get the full power of tethered gaming when linked, and completely portable vr (albeit lower quality vr) when un-linked for the same price as a rift s (which is limited to pc use only).

However this is all speculation and only waiting for the full release of this feature will reveal if this is actually possible. Of course, if you can't wait and wont feel buyers remorse if the quest turns out to be as good as it sounds. Go for the Rift S.",Vive
"There have been a few bundles of the vive pro. One is just the headset, one is just the headset and controllers, and one with the headset controllers and lighthouses. You'll need the lighthouses for anything to work. I'm guessing the index is too pricey for you right now?",Vive
Yes considering I just spent 600+ to fix my computer,Vive
"In that case I'd say go for it. Keep your back to the side you can't stretch out your arms. Keep your feet planted and use snap/smooth turn in game.

If you do find you hit something, after a while you will subconsciously be remembering to curtail your reach.",Vive

I mean technically if you’re gonna play half life VR anyways you’re saving 60$,Vive
"Right, but you don't need the base stations to pair... They're passive and don't need to communicate with you computer or the headset to work. The only reason they have Bluetooth is for firmware updates and for the power management.",Vive
"Was in the same situation and upgraded the headset and controllers.

Controller upgrade was 100% worth it. Having the finger tracking and the ""grip"" be closing and opening your hand instead of two buttons to squeeze has made a huge difference in any game I play.

I like to think of the headset being ""worth"" 300/500 of the price for me.
I LOVE having the built in speakers, so convenient and better sounding than I expected. Also great that I can hear if someone wants my attention and just raise them up.

The visuals are definitely better, partly because the headset is able to fit my head much cleaner than the vive. Someone else mentioned being careful about your specs and I think i might be experiencing that, some games aren't keeping up as well as they used to.

Hope this helps. I'm happy with upgrading both but the controllers are for sure the biggest impact",Vive
SteamVR works with one base station in front of you but the tracking won't be perfect. As long as you don't occlude their view of the base station it should be playable,Vive
"Okay thank you! I’ll definitely try it out, if not I’ll just try and clear my schedule to drive the 2 hours to get the other one lol",Vive
That too. But still after taxes and shipping it's 300 for controllers.,Vive
Primarily individual finger tracking,Vive
"So as long as it's there, physically sitting on the shelf and pointing at the headset, it will update the position without needing to be connected to the computer? Because the stations don't even show online in the Pitool software.",Vive
"Gotta say, happy cake day",Vive
"Ditto. 

I was waiting for them to come out in Canada, and when they came out I was still fence sitting. 

But Alyx is a $60 day one purchase for me anyway, and when I found out they come with a copy.. instant sale.",Vive
"Finger tracking isn’t implemented in Skyrim, unfortunately. But the joysticks are for movement/turning in vr just like pancake. NaLo has touchpad press defaulted as the activator, which is way more comfortable than clicking the grip on the vive wands. I found my hands would cramp after a few hours of play, but with the index controllers just rest your thumb on the touchpad and you’re good. No button clicking needed. I use NaLo for general movement &amp; exploration, but swap to joystick in combat for the ability to easily backpedal &amp; strafe.",Vive
And if you do this make sure to use a strong filament like petg or abs if you can print it,Vive
"There are 3d printed stuff on thingiverse, you could see if any of your local makerspaces have 3d printers",Vive
Base stations are literally the dumbest pieces of technology that do an amazing and powerful thing. They are nothing more than laser shooters. The pairing and all that is only for power management. All you need to do is plug in the lighthouse and have the headset see it.,Vive
Yeah Beatsaber is honestly unplayable for me using the Index Controllers. I'll use my Vive wands for that.,Vive
"Have fun! Make sure the lighthouse is set up as ""A"" when used by itself as ""C"" won't work and ""B"" supposedly runs at 30hz with one base station",Vive
Beat saber on 1 saber mode maybe,Vive
No but you could buy a sheet of Velcro for cheap and then cut it out using the foam thing as a template,Vive
And it does that by simply pointing the station in its general vicinity? It doesn't even need to show as Connected in Pitool?,Vive
"Look into Voice Attack. It's a great Voice command app that you can to trigger any keyboard or other command, even in different applications at the same time. So if you can bind a key to start recording, you can set a voice trigger in voice Attack.  


https://voiceattack.com/",Vive
Will do thanks!,Vive
"I was in your situation. I upgraded. I don't regret it. The visual fidelity alone makes the Index worth the purchase.

For some games though, I wish I still had vive wands, the knuckles took like a dozen hours for me to really feel like I was getting used to and I had to order some 3D printed extensions for the controllers to make them fit my hands better.

But I was able to sell my OG vive complete set for $400 so that helped me offset the cost, even though I wasn't able to keep my vive wands that way and the knuckles were weird at first, now a few months later, I feel like it was totally worth it.

I enjoy being in VR way more know, don't get as fatigued, and find the visual quality FAR more immersive.",Vive
"Gotcha, thanks =)",Vive
I see i see thank you!!,Vive
It will become shown in the tool once the headset physically sees the base station in real life through line of sight while the base station is powered on.,Vive
"Did you sell your old wands, and if so how much for? I'm considering doing the same",Vive
"Ok, that's the problem: It's not happening. My Pimax never sees the base station, so it always shows ""Not Connected"" in Pitool.",Vive
"A HMD is like a monitor. It doesn't save your data (not speaking for Facebook HMD), it just displays the games.",Vive
"Index is trash. Only think it had ok is the FOV and audio. The glare is horrible and so there is constant imersion brake specially when there is dark areas. And also the black leveles Are mushy and poor. Index controllers Are kind of great but At the same time feel cheap and the finger stracking has annoying latency. Maby mine had Something wrong with them i don’t know. It Was impossible for me to throw a granade, it Was always landing beside me. 
Comfort is ok if you think strapping anything into your head is comfortable. 
Personally i think it Was not worth anybodys time At those visuals. I would rather wait for Something with oleds, its a sad fact thst though LCD offers Some great benefits but with out local dimming when strapped to your face its a total shitshow technology imersion and image vise.",Vive
"Then something else is wrong. You don't ""pair"" a base station to anything. It is a dummy object. I don't know what else to do to diagnose this, I'm just here to tell you that you don't pair a base station.",Vive
True.,Vive
"Heck, back in the day I did that with my Oculus DK2!  Had to have the screen set to be pretty large to be usable, but with the right config, it worked.",Vive
"It mostly seems to be issues with the Vive Pro + wireless, which requires a much higher bandwidth than the OG Vive. It's like if someone said ""My GTX 1070 is dropping frames with this setup"" and sure, yours doesn't, but that's because you're running 1080p while they are on 4k.",Vive
That's the thing: Everything else I've read while trying to troubleshoot is that it DOES need to connect via the SteamVR Bluetooth settings.,Vive
I don't understand why that is: Do you extend the reach of your Vive controllers by holding them by the base of the handles?,Vive
"As someone who has owned both, I can tell you the visual fidelity on the Index is hands down a much better experience. Even with the difference in screens",Vive
"Thunderbolt PCIe enclosure with an active optical cable from Corning. Very spendy but possible. Then you don’t need a long coax cable, you just mount the enclosure on the wall.",Vive
"Rift S is the comparable tech, and is actually the better option than the quest if you want it mainly for PCVR.

The screen in the S is deceptively good, check out the through-lens comparisons of the headsets. As someone who bought the S when Quest/S came out, as long as you don't have a weird IPD, I would still suggest the S over either of those.

Also wtf is that gaudy, awful oculus-knockoff controller the cosmos has? I just went to look at a comparison and ugh... Oh and the cosmos controllers take twice the AAs that rift touch controllers do. Either way get yourself some Eneloop rechargables, they're the best.",Vive
"Huh! That’s certainly an interesting idea, thanks!",Vive
"&gt; is coming on December the 10th and seems to be a game that people either think is the second coming of christ or just a tech demo.

TLDR - Boneworks is the tech demo of the second coming of christ.",Vive
Hmmm so that would mean I would have to toss my adapter out for the index if it ever goes wireless. Bummer...more money smh,Vive
"I think on upgradimg from my rift s.

It has shit sensors and the exclusives are way too overpriced...",Vive
"It's just the shape of the controllers and the shifted weight. With the knuckles, the saber blades poke out of the top of your hand instead of the top of the Vive wand. It's only a few inches but it makes a difference. The weight is more significant, tho - the wands have some weight at the front and therefore feel more like you could be swinging a long thing.

Ultimately I'm not going back to wands for it though. I think it's more just getting used to the difference than it being worse, and I had a problem with accidentally pressing the menu button on the wands constantly, pausing mid swing!",Vive
"No, on the contrary - you hold them close to the center of mass. You can hold them rather loosely, that way game's ""100 degrees before, 60 degrees after"" condition can be satisfied easier and in shorter time. Moving just the controller is faster and less energy consuming than moving the whole palm (and sometimes hand with it - because you can't flex your wrist that far).
Think about it this way: movements of your palms are way more constrained (by your flexibility) than movements of the sticks in your hands. And with Knuckles you only get same movements as your palms (because they are strapped to them).",Vive
"Hey all, I have some relatives that are boomers coming over for thanksgiving. (all memes aside, this is actually their age bracket). I'm looking for games and experiences that they will enjoy/be interested in.

I have Beat Saber for my cousins who are my age, as well as H3 for one of my uncles who's a huge gun nut. Other games I have include Gorn, Richie's plank experience, Google Earth VR, and Tilt Brush.

Do y'all have anything bite sized that will appeal to them? I've got a couple ideas for Steam VR Homes that I can show them, but any ideas are appreciated.",Vive
"This makes me worry about my 2600k. If I have to upgrade that I'll have to upgrade my motherboard *and* ram, which is gonna be fucking annoying and expensive.",Vive
"&gt; I also regularly had to remove the adapters to remove dust on the screen.

First person I've ever heard with this issue, guess those adaptors had a gap in them.

&gt; you don't have the adapters touching your face at the closest setting

Again a personal problem of your face shape as never had this issue

&gt; The Index doesn't need a lens mod though,

Only if you like and enjoy Freznel lenses with all the additional glare from the rings, the very small sweet spot and the drop from AMOLED down to LCD",Vive
Pimax 4k? It doesnt even use lighthouse tracking.,Vive
"If you're using voice attack, consider using Win+Alt+G as your bind as that will ""Record That"" in game bar if it's set to be actively recording during vr games.",Vive
You mean 45+?,Vive
"As others have already said, adjust the top strap to lift the HMD up...also remember to blink in VR, sounds daft I know, but it's a natural human response when staring intently at something close up to blink less.",Vive
I got Half-Life: Alyx in my library even though I don't own an index anything. I think I might have gotten the Valve Complete Pack with my Steam Link though as I also have Artifact for free.,Vive
yes,Vive
"I agree with all your points.

1. Most gamers prefer games with progression. They are far more popular than open ended sandbox games. The only exception is minecraft, but minecraft is sort of unique in that genre for how popular it is. When it comes to VR, since people expect to be able to interact and manipulate everything, you'd have to have a minecraft x100 times to achieve the same imagination immersion in VR. That being said, I can think of a bunch of games that can be ""sandboxish"" but also have goals and would be quite popular if implemented on VR or PC.
2. I think you identified the biggest weakness correctly, which is ""how much content is there on launch""? Its not actually reassuring that ""yeah there will be a sandbox mode"", which is basically an alternative to launching up H3 for some target practice. How well written is the story? Will it ever feel like you're part of the story or will it feel more like a killbox level where you move from A to B while killing stuff along the way?

I just hope this game isn't overhyped and people's expectations don't match what the game is like on release. Yeah its going to be in early access. And luckily they are launching ahead of HL:Alyx because god damn, if that game came out first they'd get rolled.

But unlike others I hesitate to call this a Tech Demo anymore unless its too short or lacks enough interesting mechanics for its gameplay (which we won't know).",Vive
"I will double-check and come back. I think 45-locked info is about legacy reprojection, or maybe even about Oculus and not Vive. What I know and checked is that nowadays SteamVR dynamically turns reprojection on and off when your FPS drops below what is current headset refresh rate set on. So what I'm saying is for Vive 80 or 45 doesn't matter - you still get reprojection in-between frames unless you hit those sweet 90...",Vive
"Thx, I'll try them!",Vive
"I have very low muscle power and barely can hold one controller in air, but can. Gamepad is laying on my knees so I can use it well) I can rotate my head freely, just can't rotate body, I will try this game at least, thx!",Vive
Already wishlisted =),Vive
"I swapped the Vive against an Index already... and I am a very happy dude. My Vive, except for the touchpad buttons, worked like a charm until I did the change.

But now, no more touchpad-button that does not work and the fidelity of the screens is so much better! 

More pixels, better refresh rate. There are less blacks due to LCD instead of OLED screens and the godrays did not get any better, but overall I am happy.

Most people also forget to think about the audio upgrade the Index offers, especially if you have issues with heat and sweat while playing. You just cannot imagine how much it helps when your ears are not fully covered to exchange heat and not feel like being stuck in a full helmet.

The cable on the Index is also so much better than that of the Vive! It does not curl up internally, which was always a pain in the ass on the Vive.",Vive
"Nobody in their right mind will recommend a Cosmos. If you can't afford an Index, best option would be get a Rift S, Quest or OG Vive.",Vive
"Just to warn you though, 1 saber is much much harder than 2 sabers to me",Vive
I'm actually hesitating to do the switch. Come back and let us know if it was worth the money.,Vive
Will do :),Vive
"But people said that there are some easier modifiers like misses and I can use slower songs, anyway I'll try first =)",Vive
"Yes, also I just thought of it but another thing you could try is 3d printing at a local makerspaces a dual saber mount, it's like that one double sided light saber from star wars, your local makerspaces will probably have a 3d printer you could use too!",Vive
"As a owner of Vive Pro, I am very much looking forward to hear about your experience. I've been thinking of adding Index to my setup, but still hesitate.",Vive
Will be back to this thread on Tuesday after I have a day with it and let some of my friends use it to get some extra hands on opinions.,Vive
"It's interesting thing to try, but I don't think that there is a printing store in our city, too small and it's in Russia =)",Vive
I have the same battery and get a max of 3.5-4 hours. wonder what the big difference is between us.,Vive
"&gt; ... doesn't sit with face well.

HTC really should have put some more effort into face-sitting.",Vive
"&gt;	I also expected to be able to throw things better, but it is still kinda awkward. 

This is true.  
It feels less like throwing and more like shot putting.",Vive
"Did you go full upgrade? New lighthouses and Controllers too?
I just got the index headset only and still have my vive just sitting there forlornly.
Best upgrade ever :)
I may even upgrade the vive controllers for the knuckles if HL:Alyx demands it :)",Vive
"Yes, for multiple reasons actually. My headset wasn’t tracking well anymore and giving me motion sickness due to it cutting out so much. My controllers also both lost haptic feedback, and lastly they one of my base stations is KIA so I was definitely in need of a whole new setup haha.",Vive
"&gt; I take it there's still no way to get an Oculus Rift working yet?

There's no need now: The Vive and the Index already work perfectly!",Vive
"Are you playing Asgard’s wrath and storm land with Revive? 

If so can you show me how cause that sounds incredible",Vive
It seems like the controllers are the problem though.  I've seen multiple people complaining that they can't be angled in the palm.,Vive
Is it a ptt button or a mic mute toggle button?,Vive
Its a ptt button,Vive
There is a screenshot button combo on the vive wand: Source: I have triggered it multiple times on accident.,Vive
RemindMe! One Week,Vive
"With the index controllers and a blade and sorcery mod you can force choke and throw people a nuke, or whip a lightsaber and it comes flying right back to you. 

In short, it’s fucking insane. Plus you’ll get Half Life Alyx for free.",Vive
LOL my phrasing wasn’t the best... :P oops!,Vive
definitely! thank you for the reminder =),Vive
"Awesome! I want to get the index, but I want to be 100% sure that 1k doesn't go to waste. Thanks! :)",Vive
"WOW, Thanks dude.",Vive
"You can disable entering the dashboard in the steam vr settings, thus disabling pausing mid swing.  I do it every time before starting beat sabre",Vive
"I made the switch as well, most significant thing for me is that text is now readable in elite dangerous and in shooters you can ""look further ahead"" when zooming in. SDE is still there but became a non issue, 140hz is great. Running with GTX 1080ti.

The earpads are over ears, sound is actually good. At this moment i took the earpads off for music games. And i think my kid can hear shooting noises and what not when he is sleeping next door.
If you have the cash and you can run it then you can consider it as a valid upgrade.",Vive
"Hijacking thread. I'm casual and I've got a WMR headset with controllers (Acer) which tracking wise is good enough for me, but the screen door effect is attrocious. The specs is not that much greater resolution wise for newer headsets, but how is the experience with resolution/pixels/screen door effect?",Vive
"I think the only game that has something close to that was Climbey vr, but then again u mostly just yeet ur self forward in that. But I also love arm-swinger mode though does tire u out more.",Vive
Natural Locomotion does this for most games. Makes Skyrim a lot less headache inducing.,Vive
"armswinger is a lot better in immersing yourself into the game, albeit mostly when you're panicking and running for cover. You can do slow and large swings to gracefully glide forward, or to do lots of small ones when you want to go real fast.",Vive
"Since I've got the dreaded V1 headset and controllers, my trackpad doesn't work on one corner. Armswinger negates that and it easy to use. Definetly more Devs need to implement this locomotion technique.",Vive
"How is it dreaded? Also, by a dysfunctional trackpad, do you mean it doesn't detect your finger?",Vive
"Most people seem to hate them and call them garbage.

I found them actually superior to Index ones in a couple of circumstances. Mostly anything involving a VR stock. It's just much easier to use it with wands.",Vive
"I like it too, but when it's not the only option, I naturally prefer smooth locomotion and being able to aim when I walk.",Vive
"Iirc it was a common method as an alternative to teleport earlier on, but people wanted to be able to move about the same as they do on pc / with controllers. Not to mention that it doesn't work if you're trying to aim a bow and trying to move by swinging your arms all at the same time, or sword and shield trying to block and move... VR needs a way to de-couple body movement from arm movement to allow full use of both hands.

Yes the arm movement is wonderful for travelling distances and running around in general, but the moment you need to do one thing with your hands and still move then it's just not practical in the slightest..... Running forwards with a 2 handed assault rifle and trying to shoot with any accuracy when one hand is swinging about just to move you.",Vive
"I currently own both, full kits. The Index is wayyy better in my opinion. Higher refresh rate makes games so much smoother (if your pc can maintain it), SDE barely even there, the ""headphones"" sound way better and not annoyingly clamping to my ears lile the Vive Pro, also much more comfortable. Overall just better. Though, black levels are simply acceptable and it gets warm after awhile.

The only reason I have the Pro is for wireless. If Valve releases a wireless kit for the Index, I'll ditch the Vive Pro faster than HTC denying warranty.",Vive
How do you aim a 2 handed weapon and move at the same time?,Vive
"I switched from Vive to index, and I still have both. The clarity is much better, the screen door used to irritate me quite a lot. The black levels aren't good, but it only really bothers me in extreme darkness, like Skyrim dungeons with mods. For games like elite dangerous I barely notice it, and being able to read all the text easily is too much of a benefit to pass up. I don't think you're going to be disappointed",Vive
"Sprint Vector has the best implementation of ""armswinger"" in my opinion. Such a shame that that game went largely unnoticed.",Vive
"I'm considering getting an index (headset only) for Elite, as it's literally the only thing I play for any length of time in VR.

Would you consider it a worthwhile improvement over the OG vive? Can you comment on any improvements to the SDE and text readability?

Currently still got a 980ti so I'm hoping that will be enough to drive it without any issues.",Vive
With effort.,Vive
!remindme 3 days,Vive
"I think it's due to how some games set the boundary condition for what they considered 'released' verses 'gripped' as the finger postionions are no longer binary like on other controllers - I finally got around to playing Arizona Sunshine a couple days back, and noticed that I had to nearly splay my palms open completely before things would no longer count as held, as even slight curvature of my fingers would still register as gripping the object.",Vive
Yeah I know and it is on the index wands too but j want to change it,Vive
"Sick,",Vive
I made the switch in the opposite direction (index to vive pro) and I can’t say one is better than the other. The screen clarity and SDE is the same in my opinion. I love the deep blacks so I lean towards the pro. What the pro lacks in refresh rate it makes up for with wireless. Not having to be mindful of a cord while playing an active game really adds to the immersion,Vive
"The index isn't wireless!? That was the only reason I was considering swapping from my OG vive, guess I'll just go with the index controllers and the vive battery pack",Vive
"Arm swinger works surprisingly well for reducing motion sickness, but you can't aim at the same time. I think a better alternative is to measure head bob or head sway, and combine it with a simple button press to walk. 


There was a rather complex demo for head bob some time ago, but I haven't heard about it since. According to Nimsony, head sway works even better, especially for slow paced walking.",Vive
"I had the occasion to play with an OG Vive for a couple of hours everyday for a week (I helped set up a VR room at work and they let me use the room after working hours), so I - AM - FUCKING - PUMPED for the evolution of VR.  
I think Alyx will let people and software houses know there is a market for VR games and experiences.

Money is very tight right now and I know it will be for a few years so I have zero chances of having a vr headset in this generation, but I'm still hyped.  
More interest + more users = more competition and cheaper headset in the future.

Also, I know how you feel as I'm the only one with a gaming pc between my friends, so I'm the crazed videogamer of the group.",Vive
Only the Quest is truly wireless,Vive
Two words: No wireless.,Vive
Just wait for HL:Alyx with headcrabs...,Vive
"If I had a Vive Pro, I would keep that and enjoy wireless. Though if you don't use wireless, you might fetch a good price for the Vive Pro headset still. 

Maybe get the Index Controllers.",Vive
"Yea, definitely a software and design thing, that I assume will get better as time goes by and devs learn to implement them better. 

Arizona Sunshine, damn it.  
There’s so many reasons I like it but the. There are so many tiny things that could be easily fixed if the devs had a quick look at it.",Vive
Hand down the old headset you must. This is the way.,Vive
This is the way,Vive
"Not Op , but as a former OG vive owner do yourself a favor and just buy the index headset already its like a whole new world in my opinion",Vive
As a former OG vive owner the switch has been beautiful Just buy the index headset and try it out there  is a 14 day return window so if you feel its not worth it then return it.,Vive
Trust me I'm aware that the 2 big VR games coming out soon are going to make me piss myself,Vive
I could care less about wireless.,Vive
Make sure to enable Windows Sonic or something similiar for the Index. It made a night and day difference in Pavlov.,Vive
I made the switch. Didn't regret it at all. The visual fidelity alone is hands down worth the cost. I see a lot of people complain about the black levels but that isnt something that bothers me at all personally. I'd much rather have a brighter/clearer screen where I can read text and better make out details.,Vive
"What card do you run yours on? Any experience running with elite?

My main concern is whether the card I have (980ti) has the grunt to push the extra pixels.",Vive

[Vive Wands as feet tracker?](/r/Vive/comments/e1glg7/vive_wands_as_feet_tracker/) by  lolursxd


Hello. I have used my Vive Wands alot, but i upgraded to the Valve Knuckles. I have wondered if i can use the Wands as Vive trackers?

"I loved the armswing loco (or ""pro"" loco as it was called) in StandOut/War Dust/Art of Fight, where you're elastically propelling yourself forward through ski-like arm motions.   


Grab the air -&gt; swing vigorously backwards -&gt; let go at the top of the arc / at max velocity as you pass your midsection  


I believe max speed using pro loco was \~10% faster than smooth joystick loco if you hit perfect swings. I often found myself using stick loco during gunfights/small adjustments, and pro loco when running long distances/trying to get away, and that balance was great.",Vive
one word: tool.,Vive
"Overclock it.  The 980ti is a beast with OC, at least mine was.",Vive
wow lol overlook so many benefits for something that doesnt matter much at all.,Vive
right? i bet he buys the next Iphone just because it is 2% better lololol,Vive
"Vive pro has some great upgrades to it including a slight weight reduction, more pixels, better tracking, and pro controllers. But if you have not played before you can save yourself ~$300 by purchasing a regular Vive setup as a first foray and still have your mind blown. If money is not a consideration the valve index is the latest and greatest, or midrange go for the Vive pro.",Vive
[removed],Vive
"The HMD upgrade was a massive difference for me, on my 2080, and well worth the money. If I had a 1060 it probably wouldn't be the same upgrade tho.",Vive
Id avoid the vive pro. Overpriced with faulty controllers. Index is the best bet if its affordable for you.,Vive

"Yeah, that's always been my concern with the arm swinging movement. Seems like a real barrier to shoot effectively. And more immersion breaking than just using smooth movement.",Vive
HL: Alyx won't require knuckles but Vive did say that they built the game to take advantage of them and they will have a separate control scheme for none knuckles owners. So you will be missing out on some of the game mechanics if you are playing it without knuckles.,Vive
"Same boat here. My friend and I both own a Vive, but no Index hardware. I got a copy of Alyx in my library, but he did not.

"Always depends on your budget. If it doesn't matter go for Index. If you still need a PC you might want to get a Oculus Quest since it's a standalone that doesn't require a PC (though HL Alyx won't be available this way. Can be connected with a PC though).    
Otherwise I'd recommend the OG Htc Vive. You can get the whole package for about 400€ and for a first VR set it's still good imo. Also you can get wireless adapters for the Vive which enormously enhances your experience.",Vive

Currently im running an i7-6700k@4.5ghz/Asus gtx 1080 with 16GB of ram. the index is running at 120 and yeah ive played quite a bit in elite dangerous with it so far love it.

"Still impossible to order Index Controllers in Switzerland... This makes no fucking sense whatsoever.

NOT COOL /u/GabeNewellBellevue !",Vive

"Honestly as someone who owns both a Quest and a Vive, I'd say a Quest is a better solution for a single VR setup. This is especially true if you have an Nvidia graphics card, with Quest Link letting you use the Quest tethered for Steam VR stuff and improved performance.   


A big part of what I love about VR is showing it to new people, and with the Quest you can do that in just a few minutes. The quest's portability is a huge factor, you can use it in much the same way you'd use any laptop for internet browsing on the go, and it has got to be the best portable Netflix et al viewing experience possible.

I love my Vive, but there are a lot more options that the Quest will continue to offer for longer, in my opinion, that make it a better buy than a ""I want something now and can't afford Index"" Cosmos. The Index will have a variety of additional improvements on either system, but the Quest will always be something you can drop down at a friend's house and have them playing Beat Saber in two minutes, and the initial tutorial ""First Steps"" from Oculus is a nice length for an introduction to VR after which people can be like ""That was neat"" or ""MORE, NOW!""

It's going to be a matter of personal preference I guess, but to me the Quest is the system that will continue to have merit even when you can afford an Index.",Vive

"Yes, but I already own a rift. :P While I *do* agree that the Vive and the Index are way better, I wish at least my rift would work so that I didn't *have* to buy another VR headset to play on linux even though I want to.",Vive
I had this issue the other day.  To fix it I switched the audio from VR headset to “Other” and picked the Vive audio device from that list.  It’s the same audio device but worked after that for some reason.,Vive
Just got my certified pre-owned yesterday. Physical condition is perfect. No scuffs or scrapes on anything. Everything worked perfect out of the box and the controllers even came mostly charged too. I’ve had a PSVR but this is my first PC VR setup. I’ve used the Vive before at a friends house so I knew I liked it and that’s why I went this route rather than buy a new rift s or something similar.,Vive
I just bought a VR Cover as well.  In the very middle is there a crease where it folds in 1/2 neatly?  I used this crease to line up the cover in the top-center of the headset and placed it around the sides and then on the bottom.,Vive

"Yeah, I don't know how other similiar solutions work, maybe better (there's dolby headphones for like 15$ on Microsoft Store, I assume if it ain't free it could be better).

"True, but the context of this conversation was a person saying that they only use the pro for wireless, and if valve released wireless for the index they would ditch the pro. The next person replied not realizing that the index had no wireless option.",Vive

The Index lenses do not suffer the same issues as the Vive fresnels, I've enjoyed using them a lot and would never feel the need to do a lens mod on my Index like I did the Pro.  You can't see any rings, text is crisp across the fov, and God rays are a lot less noticeable than Vive.",Vive
"I have both the Rift and the Vive, and hands down the Vive wins for me. Im not a HTC fanboy, this is - incidentally my first HTC product - and is just my experience after owning both headsets and trying them side by side. There are lots of little things that win me over with the Vive. Hopefully i can explain the pros and cons to each.

I plan to soon upgrade to the Valve index, as it is the clear overall winner. However also has the price tag to match. In regards to HTC vs Oculus;

HTC Pros:

1. The sensors are wireless. The vive only needs 1 USB and 1 HDMI whereas the oculus needs 1 HDMI and 1 USB for the headset, and then an additional USB for EACH tracker in the space (Ideally you want 3 for 360 tracking to match the vive - 2 is workable though)
2. You only need 2 sensors (both included) for full room scale 360 VR
3. The Field of view on the Vive is much better, however the lenses on the oculus take the win, but that may be resolved with the GearVR lense mod which is in the post (Ill try remember to update this when iget them through)
4. The tracking seems more crisp and accurate on the Vive. The oculus (for me at least) have me restricted to a much smaller play space, and if i try push the sizing further, i get tracking issues (Oculus play space is barely long enough for both arms outstretched while stationary)
5. Its expandable! Yes yes, i know the Oculus can be expanded by adding more sensors, but not nearly to the extent of the vive. The great thing about the vive is the base stations and trackers are ""universal"" minus the oculus. Because they use SteamVR, you can look forward to new hardware such as the Pimax headset, or the Valve Knuckles. I don't believe these can be used with the oculus trackers or controllers (I may be wrong)
6. Less light bleed, i find that the oculus has much more light bleed into the headset itself, however i suspect thats only due to a dodgy face cover i have on the headset, so take this point with a pinch of salt. -- That said, there does seem to be much more bleed from the nose rest, where you can look down your nose, and clearly see out of the bottom of the headset. I cant do this on the vive.

However its not all positives with the Vive; and there are some points where the Oculus wins

1. The controllers are SIGNIFICANTLY better on the Oculus, they fit the hand nicer and they have some gesture support (select digits are actually tracked by pressure and proximity sensors) -- Note: The Valve knuckles for the Vive will soon match if not exceed this
2. The price. Yes, the oculus is cheaper, however from my experience, you can tell its cheaper. Both headsets are predominantly plastic but the oculus has a matte finish whereas the vive is a smooth finish, and so far, the matte, while looking nicer, has picked up more marks from less use.
3. The oculus comes with headphones built into the headset. The vive does get this option, but only with the addition of a £100 headstrap which for me is a must have.
4. The 'sweet spot' for having the content in focus is much much bigger on the oculus. (again, i will update this when i get the GearVR lense mod, as this should resolve this) You position the headset on your head for comfort, rather than for clarity.

If all you care about is standing / seated VR experiences, (Golf VR, I expect you to die, Beat saber, etc) then the Oculus would probably take the win, as you wouldnt need a 3rd sensor for games like that; and the price couldnt be beaten.

However, if you wanted to experience room scale VR, or games where you may be required to be able to reach 360 degrees, you will probably be better going for the HTC Vive. The vive is just as good for standing games, however gives more flexibility when it comes to the kinds of experiences you can have in VR.

Both headsets have their pros and cons, however if you dont mind the extra investment, the vive gives a superior experience. However, dont touch the Vive Pro, unless you can snap up a refurbished set for £500 on ebay. Ive also tried this, however the Field of view seemed much smaller for me. However Id like to give it another go now that im more comfortable with my vive, and how it rests.

TLDR; If you are on a budget and dont care for 360 tracking (You dont mind always facing your PC) then get the oculus with 2 trackers (2 are included when you get the Headset and Controller combo - Only 1 sensor if you get the controllers or headset individually) However, If you have a little more cash to get the best experience, go for the Vive.",Vive
"Mortal Kombat 1 and 2 all of the characters literally had the same reach, speed, health and normal attacks.  The only difference between them was their special moves (in terms of technical aspects).  The palette swap characters and the jokes that went with them was scary apropos to what the early games were like.  So I don't think Mortal Kombat deserves credit initially for being a solid fighter.",Vive

"Yeah, i mean it ‘s HL3 right? Everything Valve made turned into some cultlike blockbuster so optimism is granted.",Vive
"As much as I love the idea as VR, most Vr shooters come down to shooting gallery type scenes you move between, fun but get old very fast, I'm hoping valve has some tricks up its sleeve to push the envelope ('inspire' future titles for years to come) kind of thing.",Vive
should i get the valve index controllers or the wireless adapters for christmas? how much do they cost? how do they work?,Vive
"Already tried a different cable. The battery seems to fk up sometimes when I use it on other stuff. But works most of the time. Note though. Ive been using this battery on the wireless for 5 months,",Vive
try using a different battery.,Vive
"&gt; enormously enhances your experience.

For games like Pavlov, where you make lots of quick turns in every direction, I find it totally unplayable if it's not wireless. Not having to think about that cable is a game changer.",Vive
"Battery life is about 3 hours. The weight is negligible, you won't even notice.",Vive
"2.0 devices work with 1.0 tracking, but not the other way around. The OG Vive will not work with the 2.0 lighthouses.",Vive
"&gt; so I have to imagine that maybe a new Vive will be released soon? 

There was one released recently. The Vive Cosmos, but the reviews are pretty bad and you should not buy it. Furthermore, I wouldn't trust HTC as a headset developer. The OG Vive was developed by Valve and just produced and sold by HTC. The HTC Vive Pro ist essentialy an overpriced Vive with a better display and a different strap-system and build in speakers.

If it's in your budged and you want to get the best consumer headset I'd go for the Index.",Vive
"&gt; The index isn't wireless!?

Not yet, no. 

If there was a wireless kit out now for the Index from Valve, at best it probably would only work with the 90hz refresh rate (since we know this is possible). Since the Index goes up to 144hz, they need something better than the currently wireless tech. 

Valve are looking at solutions for wireless (according to an interview) but no idea if or when we will see it.",Vive

"You mean the difference of the resolution? If so, it is important to note that the Index uses different displays than the Vive Pro. The Vive Pro uses OLED displays (Pentile) and the Index uses LCD Displays. LCDs have a different pixel layout. While the Vive Pro has only two subpixels per pixel, the Index has three subpixels per Pixel, which increase the sharpness. The visual difference is pretty obvious.

On the other Hand, the Vive Pro has better contrasts and deeper blacks.",Vive
holy shit that is one very detailed answer! thank you so much!,Vive
"So if you have push- to-talk on the default state is muted, so when the dashboard is up your mic will always be muted (manually changing it should work until you close the dashboard)

so once you are back in game you should be muted unless you hit the PTT button.

The only thing that can really interfere with it is the proxmity sensor option which you may want off.

In terms of non-social oriented games, there's only a few popular multiplayer titles. Onward, Pavlov, the Echo games (Arena and Combat), and coop adventures if you have a buddy.

"Controllers: They are fucking amazing but not every game uses their capability. boneworks and half life Alyx, will be an incredible experience with them. And oculus exclusives are also fucking amazing with the index controllers (and index) so make sure to set up oculus home and revive.  blade and sorcery, Pavlov, Onward also have great index controller support. Onward doesn’t have 120fps support. FYI. 

okay. Now, the valve index headset will blow you away... it’s litterally fucking amazing. 10x better than the vive. like wow... but it takes time to figure out the best fit. Make sure you watch the valve guide on how to fit it properly. the headset strap should be as low as possible on the back of your skull BUT SHOULD NOT touch your ears and stay just above. make sure to adjust the FOV knob so the lenses are as close as possible to your eyes BUT so that they don’t touch your face.. you’ll see what I mean. FOV is also a really great improvement. 

What are you PC specs? Cuz just know that even with a 1080 and i7 9700k 120hz mode works.. but I cannot supersample with my setup so I’m trading off a more blurry image for higher FPS. If you have a 1080 or LESS I recommend playing with 90fps mode First so you can see the max clarity the headset can offer, then after you find the right fit and stuff ... jump up to 120fps. steam VR will tell you the recommended super sample ratio though.

But, with the upcoming boneworks, Espire (which may be iffy), Half Life: Alyx, etc, hopefully it will provide an incentive for bigger companies to step in.",Vive
"can't speak for everyone but i strap the battery to the headset with a single stretchy velcro strap from the dollar store works great and even acts as a counter weight.

i didn't spend so much just to have a wire going down to my pants!!",Vive
"Quest is All-in-One with 6DOF FTFY.  Saying the Quest is wireless conveys that it's brain is located not on the headset and is being processed somewhere else and then wirelessly transmitted...it is not, it's truly a great piece of tech (albeit with lower graphic capability).  More so the Gear Vr and the GO are also all-in-one but not 6 degree of freedom (they are only 3dof) and additionally the VIVE FOCUS though not as popular in the states and more used for enterprise is also All in one with 6DOF, so it's not really fair to say that the QUEST is wireless, and also the only truly one.  Thank you for attending my TIK TOK.",Vive
0%,Vive
I agree and have held off myself due to this. Right now still rocking Vive Wireless with index controllers.  But thinking about getting the Index headset for my seated experiences where wire doesn't really matter and keeping my Vive for the roomscale experiences until Valve or someone else releases a wireless solution.,Vive
Do you use the original head strap or the Deluxe Audio with the headphones removed?,Vive
Well this has now entered my bookmarks.,Vive
doesn't every game on steam use steam input now? so you should be able to rebind everything. or is it an angle issue?,Vive
"The free Half Life Alyx might be, that's what scares me... I'm pretty sure that the controller can be used anywhere, so if you don't care about this game, get them :)",Vive
"That is exactly the specs I had when I had my vive for 3 years.. then also when I got my index.. but I upgraded to an i7 9700k so I could at least play boneworks and half life Alyx at 120fps (physics right) but yea.. just play most of your games at 90fps for the best experience and image. Pavlov will work great at high res with 120fps tho on your specs. 

If you upgrade definitely do the CPU and mother board and RAM first so you can hit 120fps in future VR games that are more physics heavy. and so that the last think you upgrade is the Graphics card cuz IMO everything else’s in your system is way more out dated than the 1080. **dont get me wrong tho you have a great computer and 120fps mode will work it’s just not gonna be as clear and yea forget about 144fps in any game but beat saber/Pavlov**",Vive
"I still have the original headstrap, as I like my own wireless headphones as opposed to the Deluxe Audiostrap ones.",Vive
"1. From original Vive? -Oh yes, I think so:

- Similar potential FOV, but easier to get positioned to make the most of it, for more people.

- A little less stereo overlap, though, and seeing all the way to the edges of the screens means that those edges will be there, within your FOV - not only near your nose, but in every direction - and hard to ignore.

- Better resolution, and full RGB, as opposed to the pentile: only-green-is-advertised-resolution-blue-and-red-is-only-71%-of-it.

- Black levels are worse, though, brightness lower, and colours less vibrant (the screens are LCD).

- Light scattering glare in the fresnel lenses is similar in intensity, but different in character: Kind of a hybrid between Vive and Rift CV1 -- like an oily film of liquid light, that slips across the lens...

- There is very little tolerance for having your eyes out of the sweet spots of the lenses, but when you do hit them, the image is fairly clear almost all the way out to the edges, This is the real strength of the index, and gives a much better sense of space.

- (EDIT: Oh, yes... The higher frame rate is indeed nice, too... :7)

...so give a little, take a little. Absolutely an improvement overall, IMHO, but not only upsides all across the board.

2. The 1.0 base stations work fine. The one thing that does not work, is V1.0 *tracked devices* (…such as original Vive and its wands) with V2.0 base stations.",Vive
"I agree. With the huge push right now and the fact that they are bundling HL Alyx with the controllers and headset I don’t think there will be a discount. 

If there is I will be requesting Valve to match or cancel my unshipped order so I can place an order for a cheaper pair.",Vive
Id say about a -3/10 shot of going on sale already.,Vive
"Nope.   
They've been spending months building up stock for the Canadians. They don't need to discount an item that just became available to a market with high demand.",Vive
The very fact this thread was made is a good reason to *not* have a sale for them.,Vive
"Well, looking at the downvoted reply this seems unpopular to say, but a 970 is most likely just sufficient to 'run' graphically more advanced titles. Even first generation Vive gains a lot in visuals with more gpu horsepower to put into supersampling and details settings. I never tried on a 970, but coming from a 980ti there's been a lot of improvement after upgrading. So I'd expect a min-specc 970 being a tremendous downer.

If you're at dipping your toes in with maybe loaned or a cheap used headset, or want to get going now on a less expensive setup, you likely can get on with your 970 for a start. But getting in at something like a Pimax or Index, I highly doubt that will be any fun at all.",Vive
is there any way to get them both working for gaming on linux?,Vive
"The Index controllers will emulate Vive wands if the game doesn't explicitly support them. That can sometimes mean that you'll need to tweak the bindings, but the only time I've seen it actually fail was with Skyrim VR (has since been fixed by a SteamVR update).",Vive
$300 to upgrade 1.0 base stations and controllers to 2.0 base stations and controllers seems kookoo bananas.,Vive
Sounds like it's from 11/28 - 12/2... Anyone know *what time* it starts on the 28th?,Vive
"The Vive pro HMD is still more expensive than the index hmd ($499)? I was under the impression that the index was better, can anyone correct me if I’m wrong?",Vive
"that's painful.

not sure how making a parody vlog would make the format more appealing? If anything, the unappealing parody makes the format less appealing by extension",Vive
"Usually it's an angle issue. Or the hands will be attached to the very end of the controller, like they're the barrel of a hand-slap gun with no handle and just a hand.",Vive
this game is a ton of fun and i had no problems finding players monday morning 12am est!,Vive
"yeah if they do, they'll have to give everyone who bought since alyx the discount... and really, the bundle IS the discount.",Vive
"iRacing is really active

Assetto Corsa is active.",Vive
Does not remind me of MK in anyway really but it does look very good and has piqued my interest for sure.,Vive
I was wondering the same but realized it wasn't going to happen so I ordered them yesterday.,Vive
"I recently bought a RIFT S which requires no extra cameras like the first gen. Compared to my vive, if vive tracking is 10/10, id say the rift s tracking to be a good 8.5 to 9. Much easier to set up as well.",Vive
"Also some games require the use of the track pad for binds because of how many there are, and using the index track pad is really difficult to hit the correct direction you want.",Vive
"I went Vive to Index myself, still using the v1 base stations with no problems. Everybody's right about the technical improvements and it's definitely noticeable and worth it for those things alone, but I want to also throw in a word about comfort.

The Index HMD is by far the most comfortable one I've ever used, especially for long sessions. Much more comfortable than Vive, Rift (original) and Quest to me. The face fit is just as snug as the Vive but it doesn't get hot and fog up like the Vive did, and it never gets uncomfortable to me no matter how long I'm in there. I expected the technical improvements but the degree of improvement in comfort was surprising. The audio quality was pretty surprising, too, especially for not even touching your ears.",Vive
Right now the question isn't whether the price will be reduced but whether there will be stock to sell.,Vive
I just saw that you may own the Valve bundle which includes all past and future Valve games if you've bought steam link or steam controller hardware and own a Mac. Maybe you have that bundle somehow?,Vive
"Payday 2 can be played in vr with regular players, its quite active",Vive
"I dont have a mac, Steam link or steam controller.",Vive
"I also have a gen 1 Vive from 2016 which has lasted 1000+ hours and survived many VR parties and sweat drenched VR work outs.

How long do other electronics last for you?  If your electronics are constantly dying you should consider getting a Geiger counter to look for radioactivity and take some iodine pills..  Or - more likely, your power outlets have serious grounding issues.",Vive
"In a shitty way I hope so. I, like a dumbass, just bought them a few days ago not thinking about a sale.",Vive
Nah I got shiped a faulty HTC first gen. Then they fixed the faulty one but it keeps dying but they keep fixing it instead of giving me a new working one.,Vive
Is orbus dead or not? I keep hearing different things.,Vive
"This game might be too expensive but it's very much like xortex (control a ship with your hand) and I enjoyed it at the time (a couple of years ago).

"Do you have this?

Maybe it includes future titles. Seems... unlikely.",Vive
"Lol I run almost every game fine with a 2600k, he's fine. Only games CPU matters a lot is gonna be stuff like bone works for the physics.",Vive
My friends does but he only knows secret mortal Kombat characters.,Vive
I own all the games but i never bought the bundel.,Vive
Why would you compare a good game to some garbage like MK? Lol,Vive
"People always use the argument of running and gunning as a case against arm swinger locomotion, despite one of the most skilled Take and Hold H3VR players using arm swinger locomotion exclusively. Look up jeditobiwan on YouTube.

The fact is, the vast majority of VR games could and should offer arm swinger locomotion as an option (especially given how much more effective it is against motion sickness than thumbstick locomotion), but don't.",Vive
"You aren't wrong, but NaLo's developer hasn't been seen online in about 3 months.",Vive
"Hmmm, Let’s go with 0.000001% instead. You never know, but I agree it ain’t happening",Vive
Here is someone [getting to the top of a leaderboard](https://youtu.be/p1R0Je_VHKU) in a shooting game while using arm swinger locomotion.,Vive
Well it'd be interesting if Vive owners got it for free but it seems really unlikely as Valve would basically be throwing this game at half the people using Steam VR. I can't verify this at all because I bought the Index controllers last week and the game appeared in my library a few hours later.,Vive
Sorry to hear you've had so many issues. Has it been the same problem over and over? Or just different things every time? Both of my Vive's are still going strong with no issues thankfully.,Vive
"The two big differences are going to be that the Vive Pro is an OLED panel versus the Index's LCD, and that the Vive Pro is able to be used wirelessly at an additional cost. The panels themselves have some smaller differences (FOV, refresh rate) but the above are probably the deciding factor for most.",Vive
"I already preordered the game... But thanks for the clarification, you had me worried for a moment.",Vive
"Oculus Quest with a link cable gives you a portable option when you want it, and a better display and lenses than the Vive. Index controllers are compatible with the Vive, but also with Link, if you buy two steam controller dongles. The quest also gets you into the Oculus ecosystem, allowing you to play exclusives without potential Revive compatibility issues. Not to mention a lot of games having cross buy with PC and Quest. Quest is also compatible with SteamVR games, at worst using the controller configurator.",Vive
too bad steam input doeant extend to positional/rotational correction.,Vive
"Quest is the newest option right? So, granted you only show one side, aside from index, which I think is just controllers I think, but so far, is it worth it then?",Vive
we got a cringe lord,Vive
Depends. A lot of time it just woudn't start up. But yeah it got confirmed it's a faulty headset that they keep repairing,Vive
"definitely not overrated. Not having to think about how many rotations you're in and not being tugged in a direction is incredibly freeing.

source: OG Vive with TPCast (Which, btw, is much better than its reputation), Index controllers and 3 pucks.",Vive
there is also a TPCast version for the OG VIve.,Vive
"Like what? You can adjust refresh rate in steamvr settings, and imo it's less comfortable than Vive+das. Wish I could get my das on my index lol",Vive
"Xinerama is supposed to be the magic ticket, but I could never get it to work. Another solution is to enable a secondary X screen for the other GPU but I could never get that to enable either. Nvidia's drivers and X suck, plain and simple. I don't know how to get it working in that configuration so I had to buy 2 DP to DVI cables and plug all of my monitors into my 2070.",Vive
"when i first got my index i absolutely thought i wasted my money. With time ive learned to love my Index Headset.

Basically the index = ogvive with better screens, and worse blacks.

It definitively is an upgrade in every way (except dark greys instead of blacks) so id say you get 80% of the VR experience in a vive... 

Im still rocking my v1 lighthouses, no need for any changes.",Vive
"Open the settings in SteamVR and go to the developer section

There is a Room and Tracking section:
Choose small or medium space and place your headset on the floor in the middle of the proposed tracking space in view of the base stations and click on the ""quick calibrate"" button.",Vive
Just keep in mind that it doesn't account for Occulus users or anything that isn't directly running through the Steam Library.,Vive
"I use a laptop with similar specs - full 2070, 8750H, 32gb ddr4. Everything runs really well, I haven't played a game that it couldn't keep up with.",Vive
Orbus was absolutely amazing and so much fun. Especially after the rework. I wish that it had been more popular within the community.,Vive
Tyvm,Vive
"I think it's a huge step. You basically get to have free hands, check out a video!",Vive
"If you are considering the vice, I'd highly recommend going with the rift S at that price range. It's just a better system overall than the vive. If you have the money for higher level, then go valve index. There isn't really a reason to go Vive anymore.",Vive
"I went from OG Vive to the Quest and haven't touched my vive since. I don't have the link setup yet (only supports certain video cards apparently) but the Quest works amazing as a standalone VR setup and the tracking is easily on par or better than the vive on its own. Plus you get the ability to be mobile, take it anywhere and put it on and boom you're in VR anywhere.",Vive
Are these deals only on [vive.com](https://vive.com)?,Vive
There software called natural locomotion that might help you out,Vive
VRChat is where I find I spend most of my time. I can just spend hours talking to people and not know. It’s really helped me get over some anxiety problems,Vive
"I found Orbus really lackluster to be honest. 

It came off more as a student's final project than an actual game. Janky, ugly and poorly implemented. 

And the price tag is just outrageous. Or was, anyway. 

Almost all games (excluding AAA) for VR fall between $10-20.. Orbus wants something like $60 for what amounts to a relatively ugly looking tech demo.

I'd love an MMORPG in VR, but sadly Orbus just ain't it.

If they had released it and asked for $15 or so, at least to start, it may have built a community. But I think they were banking on being ""the only VR MMORPG"" so people will pay what we tell them, kind of thing. 

Welp. Nope.",Vive
I haven't tried the Vive Pro but I actually prefer the DAS to the Index strap. Headphones on Index are way more comfortable though.,Vive
Where do you go to just chat with people? When I've tried it's just a bunch of site-seeing and awkwardly standing around while people play low quality audio clips over voip,Vive
"I did too, don't worry though - very little chance of a discount....",Vive
I personally love VRChat and spend hours talking to people,Vive
"The tracking is worse than the Vive due to blind spots, but the Quest with Link is currently my primary headset at this point. It's worthwhile as an upgrade, but if your IPD is small enough, the rift S would be better, I think.",Vive
"On your purchase history does it say steam promo or something? Maybe you won the wish list thing. Not sure when they chose winners, but others had games randomly added very recently and was because they won the games in their wishlish for buying something in the last sale I believe. Maybe you added it when it was announced and they chose winners later.",Vive
"Rec room is fun, but 90% kids. Which is weird, because I assumed for the entry price of VR, there wouldn't be so many kids.

Standout is fun, if you like pubg. The graphics are trash, but the gunplay is on par with pavlov.",Vive
"I hope you have better luck then me! A few people are having issues with it being waaay to quiet, me being one of them:( tried everything from reinstalling audio drivers, unchecking options like gain reduction etc, no luck:/ had that thing cranked to 100 and it was just barely audible",Vive
"Interesting, I'll give it another shot",Vive
It's more or less abandonware nowadays.,Vive
"They only just released the things this summer, and you know what they would say if it goes on sale after only 6 months? ""OMFG Vavle flop controller sucks so bad they have to reduce price to get rid of exces inventory!!!1""

I think the fact they give you a $60 game to go with the controllers makes it a pretty sweet deal, and also if you compare it to the price of Vive wands, each wand was $130 so that would be $260 for a pair...  And the knuckles are a solid upgrade over the wands for most games.",Vive
Trust me the head strap on the Pro is so much worse than the DAS. I only got the Pro over the OG because I want that sweet 4 base stations tracking.,Vive
"My IPD? Either I’m just being forgetful, or I haven’t heard that term, what’s it?

How much worse?",Vive
"Out of curiousity reading up on the link, I just realized, do most vive games work on oculus?",Vive
Oh an if anyone is wondering I'm running a 2700x with a 2080 (none of them overclocked) and Beat Saber on an SSD,Vive
"Highly doubtful.

Maybe the full index setup will go on sale, but I doubt the controllers",Vive
Oh sad,Vive
"I don't like MK games personally, but they're clearly not bad games.",Vive
Thanks for your elaborated answer :) seems like you own or at least tested both? How much can you feel the fov change between Vive (not pro) and index? Is fov on index actually that more remarkable?,Vive
I don’t understand how it’s like MK (I have the game and play it a lot),Vive

"Windlands 2 is pretty awesome, if you're into spider man / bow and arrow kind of action.",Vive
Espire is already out.,Vive
dpad is an abstraction designed for flatscreen gaming. With VR you want to remove as many abstractions as possible and have as many actions as possible correlate to the actual physical actions you would do if it was reality. If you can't move your feet then your arms is the second best thing.,Vive

[deleted],Vive
"&gt; With VR you want to remove as many abstractions as possible

*Without making the game a pain in the ass to play.",Vive
"wow wow wow, this was so much better than I was expecting.

I'll give you my thoughts from memory as I played through.

1) No free locomontion was a bummer, I find that the visual paralax of moving through an environment adds a lot to the scale of the environment. And considering you have a flyable helicopter in the game ... could you please add an option for free locomotion? :)

2) The grip on the torch doesn't snap to your hand, which is an interesting take on torch handling. I can see why, considering that there are many types of motion controls these days, snapping to a particular angle could be uncomfortable for some controllers.

3) I dropped the torch once in a hard to reach place, I feel like this could benefit from either a) the torch, once in your inventory will reappear in your inventory when dropped, or b) you can pick it up telekinetically.

4) Graphics were very very good. In fact, the 2d nature of the graphic you're using in the marketing materials made me think this wouldn't be so realistic. The interior architecture was really well lit and designed, and the integration between the contemporary and the brutalist concrete was really well done.

5) I didn't know anything about Buzludzha except that I'd seen the monument in articles about old communist architecture. So I had no idea the state of disrepair that the place is currently in. When I got to the dark gallery, I felt incredibly sad. I didn't realise it was so far gone, as your experience shows it in such a wonder light. It did make me wish for a toggle to transition from your incredible unreal work to something like a photogrammetry scan of the crumbling decay of the real world Buzludzha monument.

6) You put fluid physics in the toilet faucets and soap dispensers that collide with the hand meshes? and made most drawers and doors interactable? Such attention to detail!

7) The torch reveals were a great feature. As mentioned above, i wish there was more of this transition between current and your ideal.

8) I really loved that I could go and see the Shipka Pass monument in the distance that was mentioned.

9) All up, it really made me want to go and experience this place, but when i realised how far the place has decayed in reality, it made me really sad. Then it also made me happy that your team has had the passion to create this experience to keep the place alive and perhaps even inspire convervation of places like this in the future...

Sorry for the rambling. I think I'm just going to copy paste this as my steam review too.

Thanks!",Vive
Hi! It works on Oculus indeed. Do you have Room Space setup?,Vive
"Is this going to be released to the public at some stage? or is this just for your internal development fun?

It's a good starting point, the photoscanned/kinect scanned avatars are nice, and the nerf guns look good. But the gameplay looks super simple. So far it doesn't seem to take advantage of the fact that there are 2 players operating in the same space.

Do you want to talk about your plans? what you're looking to do with the game?",Vive
"...Also, sorry to be a party pooper, but you should probably change the Nerf name... unless you have arranged licenced use of the Nerf brand.",Vive

"I have access to both at work. Index has better audio, refresh rate, comfort and less screen door effect. As for the FOV the index has better FOV than vive and oculus but not much better than a vive pro since you can push the screen close to your eyes in the vive pro.",Vive
I've heard end of the year but I'm not sure,Vive
"I live in Newcastle, so if your heading up this far, your more than welcome to come try out my index",Vive

"Is SDE better with pro or index?

Edit: nvm, someone below commented index has better SDE. Unless anyone disagrees.",Vive

Only downside I found was the colours weren't as bright, just seemed a little washed out compared with the vive, but you soon get used to it.",Vive
Makes sense. Thanks for the info!,Vive
The hand issue would be an issue with the regular Vive controller too. Any game that exhibits that problem had the hands placed incorrectly to start with.,Vive

can't be good if you've got a small house or are clumsy either if VR is how i imagine it to be.,Vive

"That's a nice start. I ended up buying the Rift last generation. HTC always seems to just slightly overprice their hardware. For this generation I'm seriously considering just throwing down $1,000 for the rift and being done with buying a new headset for four years or so.",Vive

"Yes I used to have the OG Vive, lighthouse 1.0, Knuckles controllers, and a wireless adapter. 

Very good setup and very convenient and easy to setup. Knuckle controllers honest are a must, especially when implemented correctly they are so cool Pavlov got so much easier to do multiple functions naturally. Just don't SLAM them into a wall cause allegedly selling cutting edge electronics against the wall damages them pretty good.",Vive

"One of the main reasons I refunded my Index in favor of keeping my Pro, was the black levels. After using the Pro so long, black in the Index were terrible.

"I feel like the biggest benefit of the Index controllers is seamless integration with Revive and Oculus exclusives, the wands don't translate very well for a lot of free locomotion games, or so I have heard, as I have yet to try.",Vive
I have a Vive Pro but maybe if you contact Valve or HTC support they will send it to you or explain a wait to factory reset it too.,Vive
"Could be one of a number of things. The shock test to the controller as well as your hand, probably disturbed an internal connection such as a wire adapter, or some other component, and since most micro chips are no longer socketed and are soldered directly to the pads, chances are the circuit board may have a crack in it, causing intermittent operation.

The only way to really know is to disassemble the controller if you can, and perform a visual inspection, which should reveal your problem. If you can accomplish that feat and you have the skill sets and tools, you may be able to correct the anomaly. If luck is with you the communications chip or some other chip is socketed and just needs to be reseated. You’ve indicated a response, but rarely, that’s a plus, so just be very careful going forward if you do not have highly technical skills and tools, because you could further damage a situation that maybe repairable. Good Luck",Vive

"On another post someone linked to a Steam discussion thread where one of the developers said something like they were dropped for performance reasons, but that there were some scenes where dynamic shadows could be enabled. They mentioned something like the shadows were the same as rendering 10-20 enemies at all times.",Vive

"They do make adhesive-backed camera mounts (like [this](https://www.amazon.com/iSaddle-Thread-Double-Sided-Adhesive-Dashboard/dp/B00BPRLV8M)) but that VHB stuff can be difficult to clean. There's also some with spring-loaded clamps as well as c-clamp like mechanism so if you had a bookshelf or bed nearby, you could clamp it to that. Or you could just get some cheap tripods and use those (and you could break those done and store them for when you're not using VR).",Vive
"That’s definitely a big help. One corner I could do a clip mount (although I didn’t even think of that, thanks!) and the other could only really be adhesive. I really appreciate the isaddle mount suggestion since it gives me a starting point! I guess adhesive dashcam mounts are a great search point, and I’ll keep in mind the VHB cleaning issues",Vive
"Maybe it has something to do with the part of the story that you're going into a video game? 

It does seem a bit wierd to not have shadows when everything else is so physics based.",Vive

"Doesn't look very good.  There, I said it.",Vive
"Awesome thanks for reply I have regular Vive with modded Gear lenses for clarity which works great. I did adjust my receiver and made a huge difference..I attempted to put on Hugh settings for PokerStars VR and looks amazing...would you think if it runs smoothly on Higj settings that getting a new graphics card would improve it even more or would you think if it or any other game that runs on High settings that that is about as good as it gets for that particular game/app? 

Thanks",Vive
About the story: did you notice that the zombie things at the end are wearing the same uniform than the player himself 🤔,Vive
"That is a very good point with the Index now in the market The Pro does seams to be in this weird place price wise. 
Comparing it to the $500 Index, you get OLED displays plus the options to add wireless, for $300 more. However you loose the high refresh rate and the OLED doesn't have the subpixel advantages of the Index. 
Plus the entire kit itself is $1600. I am not sure what this extra $600 is really getting you. Maybe if they through in the wireless to the kit but even then it is still over priced. 

When it first came out I felt it was way over priced, but they they had the best product on the market at the time so I couldn't really argue with them. But with the second generation of headsets they have priced themselves out of the market in my opinion. I think they really need to change something in order to stay competitive.",Vive

Does this guy think this is half life?,Vive
"The Index controllers are really pricey, costing more than some full HMD/controller kits, so I think it makes sense it was included. This makes the purchase of the controllers a bit less of a bitter pill to swallow.",Vive
Going to build a noob toob here soon. Any advice on length of the piece of pipe between the controllers?,Vive
You can keep using your Vive controllers too. There's honestly no reason to buy the Index controllers for games where you're using a gun stock anyway. The finger tracking is largely irrelevant in those types of games.,Vive
I am glad they included it. The Knuckles controllers were quite pricey and I semi-regretted buying them. This sweetens the deal significantly.,Vive
"That seems like a crazy amount of work, it would only be worth the effort if you really hated the trackpad (it seems like you don't?) or just enjoy modding the bejesus out of hardware. How would you even graft a stick to it that felt at all natural?
 
Personally I'm a fan of the trackpad for the Vive, for the simple reason that it's actually easier and smoother to do fine movement by rolling your thumb instead of shifting your entire thumb. Thumbsticks feel a little mechanical in comparison, although they have the benefit of having a fixed axis and not bumping them accidentally (and that will probably happen a lot with the trackpad).

I can't really answer your question in earnest, but if you don't already know the answer, I suspect it is not worth the effort.",Vive

"Looks interesting, haven't heard of it, thx!",Vive
"At first glance E,B,G looks best for the most coverage.

However, I think you need to first consider where you want your actual play area to be, and also whether you want an irregular (non-rectangular) shape. Even if you get more overall play area, an irregular shape may be more of a hassle to deal with, since you can get awkwardly stuck in the corner. That cut-in between D and F is really unfortunate for optimizing play area. 

Basically if you want your play area to primarily be between the couch and the wall, then just do C,E,F and don't worry about losing a small amount of the kitchen.   


It looks like even if you push the couch back to the far wall you're not actually gaining much play area beyond where C is located, so location E doesn't actually do much for you.",Vive

"For months I was asking myself the same question. And I made a decision I am more than happy with.

&amp;#x200B;

I could not try the indey yet but for me there is 1 main reason Vive Pro &gt; Index.

OLED

&amp;#x200B;

For more than 15 years I was searching for perfect picture quality. I had more than 20+ displays at home (TV, PC monitors, etc.) and there is no better display type than OLED. The ability to light every damn single pixel independently and till pure black gives you contrast that no other panel can match. This gives picture just so much more ""punch"" and depth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here´s an example from a youtube comparison that shows exactly that:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sim-gFg\_lp0&amp;t=428s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sim-gFg_lp0&amp;t=428s)

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I did the Gear VR Lens Mod. I made sure that every surface of the ground and the lens is as flat as possible. This is extremly important as 3D printers often do not print 100% flat surfaces. I used  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804)  V3.3. and a Gear VR 323. I got 0% distortion and I did not need any modification file. I tried Arizone Sunshine, theBlu, TheLab, The Wizards, SteamVR Home, Onward, and many more. No distortion at all.

You lose a little FOV but now the combination of the OLED picture quality, almost no god rays (night and day difference), huge sweet spot (night and day difference) and clarity (night and day difference) is overwhelming. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to try the Index to see how much the high refresh rate impacts the experience but I can not imagine any better picture quality at the moment than Vive Pro with the Gear VR lens mod. And the option to go wireless is something to consider too.",Vive
Has there been any talk about dismemberment with bladed melee weapons?,Vive
"If by HL3 you mean the newly announced Half-Life: Alyx, then we won't know for sure until its release, but right now it looks like both hands working together are rather important.

Beat Saber has a dedicated one-handed mode, although it's more challenging then the basic one.

Is your arm totally incapable of any movement, or can it perform some basic moves? I'm asking because Microsoft developed a special controller to help disabled people fully enjoy video games.

"Summary for those who dont want to watch the video.

As im sure alot of you are already aware Boneworks is coming on December the 10th and seems to be a game that people either think is the second coming of christ or just a tech demo.

I sit somewhere in the middle, I can see alot of good things with this game its doing differently and also have some concerns and in this video I am going to go over the reasons why I think people are so hyped for this game and add my concerns at the end.

**Inverse Kinematics** \- The first thing this is doing well is the Inverse Kinematics, Inverse Kinematics arent new, We are seeing more and more games ditch the floating hands and give you a full body in VR with mixed results. Boneworks seems to be one of the best I have seen. You can see in the video the way the wrist and hand position seems perfect.

(I explain what Inverse Kinematics is in the video but wont go into it here as im sure most know what it is)

Having an in game body rather than floating hands can really add to the immersion, as long as it isnt completely off compared to our real world body.

**Full Physics Body** \- Not only is the body visible in VR in boneworks but its actually a full physics body. This means your body, not just your hands or head can interact and influence the enviroment. (I show some examples of this in the video) In the past we have seen games rely on you having to use your hands to open doors or even only being able to open a door on a single contact point like the door handle.

Having a full body will make moving and interacting with the enviroment more natural and we have already seen this with Blade and Sorcery but you can still ghost objects through your body and arms which isnt possible in Boneworks (again I show examples of this in the video) 

**Physics everything** \- but it isnt just the body that is physics based. Everything is a phyics based object that reacts like it would in the real world. You cant ghost through walls or tables, Tables can be flipped. Objects have weight so heavier objects are harder to move around, this is done by adding a delay to your movements and the object moving which we have seen already in early VR games like robo recall. The developers at epic games added a slight delay to when you moved the shotguns to try to make them feel weighty, It was very subtle and worked really well and we are seeing this same thing applied more and more in games like Blade and Scorcery and the upcoming walking dead saints and sinners game.

This is exciting because it adds so many possibilitys to how the game can be played and we have already seen a strong community get behind blade and sorcery with people spending hours messing around in what is just a sandbox tech demo right now.

**Boneworks Engine** \- from my understanding Boneworks is using Unity for the graphics side of things but the physics engine, the inverse kinematics etc has all been made in house by stress level zero. This means they can potentially sell boneworks as a plugin for other developers to use so indie developers can make there own games with all the benefits of Boneworks but without having to spend the many many hours coding everything. This could open up the potential for a new wave of VR games with all of these features which has huge potential and is very exciting. There has been no word on this from the develpers though so it will be interesting to see how that side of things develops.

**Half life 2 vibes** \- Another reason this game is getting so much hype is due to the similarities to Half Life, the developers havent shyed away from half life being an influence on the game design even showing the iconic crowbar and gravity gun in previous videos. It has a look and feel of a Valve game and people have even speculated about this being a valve game in disguise.

**Node Video** \- I think the last reason this game has built up such a lot of excitment within the VR community is down to the Videos made by Node showcasing the game. They did a really good job with the way they showed the gameplay highlighting all the reasons previously mentioned why this game could be a big deal and the Boneworks videos have gone viral.

I dont think there is one thing boneworks is doing better than any single game I think its a combination of all of these things that make it look like a really big step forward in many different ways and I cant wait to play it in December.

There are some concerns for me personally though, Mainly the actual content of the game. They have confirmed its going to have a story describing it as a narrative VR action adventure but no word on how long it will take and have been a little evasive on the steam forums when asked simply stating it varys from person to person. I understand it will vary but some sort of ball park figure would be good. If the singleplayer story is short and most of the game is just a physics based sandbox it will lose alot of appeal for me.

I personally prefer a game with progression and dont enjoy open ended sandbox games much but judging by Blade and Sorcery I may be in the minority on that one. They also have removed the shadows from the game as you can see in the latest trailer (shown in the video). The earlier footage has shadows and they even commented on the lighting in previous videos so its a little dissapointing to see the visuals take a step back although not a deal breaker and I understand its due to performance reasons as they are already pushing the CPU hard due to all the physics. I think an option to turn them on would be good even if its in some sort of advanced settings menu.

Lastly I have heard rumours the game is launching in early access, this is a personal thing but I dont like playing games with a single player campaign that are in early access, I prefer to wait for them to be finished so I can play through the final version of the game.

And thats it, hopefully some people found this interesting and I would be interested to hear what other peoples thoughts are on the game, are you excited or do you think its just a glorified tech demo?",Vive
"You're welcome! The whole development process was quite a journey for us even though the final product is not overly complex. Yes, we still remember the joys of trying out new content shared on Oculus Share, those were fun times!",Vive
"Yes, for example hidden layers that you can reveal with a special flashlight to gain more insight about the monument's past and present state.",Vive
Thanks man!,Vive
"In all fairness, the makers of robo recall, the gods of epic engine had to drop shadows too. They made 2d work around for it to still look good but didn't actually use shadows",Vive
"Very good summary of your preferences and decision making. I'm still rocking my OG Vive and still love the colors of the OLED screen.
Over time I got DAS when released and went wireless meanwhile. 

The next thing I will need to update is my CPU, GPU and RAM next to a good Mainboard. This needs to come first before I will decide for another HMD. With all my equipment though the Vive Pro is the most rational and logical way to go afterwards.

Wireless is not just a gimmick. 
I got the Knuckles on release and they are really valuable and finger gesture tracking is a great thing but had to sell unfortunately because I'm left handed and am switching the controllers multiple times from one hand to another during a VR session. Another thing is my heald hand after it broke at spring time which somehow likes the wands more.

Yet big thanks to Valve for my HL.A gift! That's insane and I'm pretty sure it will bring VR finally the attraction it needs and deserves! 
I",Vive
"I own both, only use the Index. Never got the wireless to work at a satisfactory level so it's a null argument.",Vive
Index is wayyy better. Take the leap. You can always turn down the resolution scaling until you upgrade your gpu,Vive
"I've been using it for more than a year and no issues, highly recommended, it has a ton of great games.",Vive
"Better sde, fov, sound, confort, tracking and controllers, so yeah its a big enough leap. Also Facebook seems to be leaving Rift S behind on favor of Oculus Quest which doesn't make me trust a lot about its future.",Vive
I've got a 1080ti w/ 9700k right now. So I guess that should be good. How is support for their controllers and stuff in the different games? And how is the ergonomics of it? Thanks!,Vive
"I've got access to the CV1, Rift S, Quest, Vive, Vive Pro, Vive Eye, Cosmos, Odyssey+, and Index, and some AR headset at work. The Index is by far the most comfortable headset physically and visually. The Knuckle controllers felt alright, but I didn't have enough time to overcome my muscle memory of never letting go of the controllers.",Vive
Thanks for the headsup! Hoping they're doing some sort of Black Friday offer :'),Vive
That's a false statement. Robo recall uses shadows on objects and enemy models.,Vive
"Everything is great. Some games bug out at higher than 90hz but you can change the refresh rate.

If a game doesn't support index it defaults to Vive wand input.

ReVive compatibility is better because it has same input as Oculus, plus trackpad and finger tracking.

Your pc is even better than mine so don't sweat. I use 8700k and 1080.
You should be able to hit 144hz easy

Comfort is great but gets heavy after about 2hrs. Learn to adjust the fit for maximum comfort/playtime.

Love playing Defector at vide fov. 

In the box there is no charge plug for controllers, just USB-C cables.",Vive
I use it since quite a while and never had any issues. There are regular updates to it and I think I will need to fire up theBlu next time I'm using it. Haven't visited it since long.,Vive
Thanks for letting me know! That's good to hear :),Vive
"I recently started playing Windlands and something just clicked. I hit a state of flow that happens frequently when playing momentum based games on flatscreens (CSGO Surfing, Distance, Floating Point) but I hadn't experienced in VR. 

Effortlessly swinging, wall jumping, and falling in the world to get to where I wanted to go and intuitive split second recoveries felt so right. Jet Island looks like it has similar movements, what other strange locomotions based games are out there?",Vive
Pretty sure that I did enjoy it. Unfortunately I have memory problems that are getting worse each year. Doctor blames my alcohol abuse when younger... the problems only started though when I stopped drinking!!,Vive
"Hmm, you may be right. I do recall a talk about epic using blob shadows in robo recall though. Maybe it was under specific circumstances? I'm sure I've seen it.",Vive
"I can understand that. So this comes down to personal preference. Picture Quality is very important to me.

How would you discribe the difference in Screen Door Effect?",Vive
"Sounds great! So the knuckles can also be seen as vive wands whenever a game doesnt support it? I'm very much into racing and flightsims, so hoping that the controllers function similarily to my touch controllers in for example Xplane 11.",Vive
"Mostly it's not a cracked board but a detached ribbon cable which can be easily reconnected.

Sure some tools and caution procedures should be taken to not damage it more.

OP should browse ifixit or search some yout. for further advise.",Vive
"That's just a fun little thing you can do. Being a VR only game is all about the tactile interaction, such as the way cover shooting and dual weilding just works.",Vive
"I have only played PC2 and VTOLvr, they work great for VTOL and the hmd is amazing for driving with the clarity",Vive
That's exactly what I expected it to be great for indeed! I'm gonna have to delve into it a little bit more. Also hoping that they drop a BF sale on it :'),Vive
"Hopefully, but if not, you get HL:A free anyways, plus extra dlc if you buy before 2020",Vive
I'd just read about that! It does look very very promising,Vive
"When the rumours that boneworks was secretly a valve game came out, it seemed like a plausible idea. But after seeing the trailer for HL:A, the level of polish that a true valve production game has is pretty stark. I’m not saying SL0 is doing a poor job. On the contrary, I can’t wait to throw money at them with boneworks. I’m just saying the there is a visible difference in the two games and it seems silly to me now that I thought it was a valve game.",Vive
"Yes, dear God yes. I have no complaints with the hmd I don't feel like it's heavy (that may be because I was used to the vive Pro's weight though) and I can play for hours, the only problem I had was the metal joint connecting the strap to the controller began to hurt the skin between my index finger and thumb though after a good amount of use that's sort of died down now. Plus the increased viewing angles, high resolution and everything else on top of supporting Valve not Facebook.",Vive
What causes better immersion doesn't give a darn about your personal preference.,Vive
"Hahahaha yes I'm fully with you on not supporting facebook! I see the resolution is like double my CV1 rift's, which sounds mindboggling. Is everything really that much clearer?",Vive

Because they work for everyone, and the ""smooth"" lenses that the GearVR has don't. Lots of people revert back to the original lenses after trying the mod. It's very individual and it depends on the physiological structure of your face and eyes.

It's one of the many compromises that you have to do when you are engineering a product that has to work for a very wide range of users.",Vive
"I'm wondering if this would work:

https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B019IFIJW8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_yOO2DbDAS0649",Vive
Yes. I feel you. I don’t get as motion sickness as I used to do I can get through a play session in a typical game like Asgard’s wrath. But that being said I far prefer teleport when I have choice. I don’t worry about if it if I won’t get sick and just enjoy the game. I asked one of the developers on their steam forum if they’d have teleport on boneworks but they said it would break the physics. I dunno if it’s true or not but it likely it won’t be coming.,Vive
"There is very good support for remapping the knuckle controllers. It does not always work right out of the box, but the tools to get what you want are there. Remember to adjust the pressure of squeeze inputs to your liking!

"I have both and I almost exclusively use the Vive Pro. The wireless works perfectly and is the reason I use it. 

The index has far better sound, microphone, and appearance of screen door effect. The Bigger FOV is also nice.

The Vive Pro has wireless, which works perfectly if used correctly. It has much better blacks and better colors. The blacks in some games really are off-putting on the Index.",Vive
"Oh I ment of the battery adapter! I forgot to add that in, my bad!",Vive

"I don´t think that Frensel lenses work for more people than optical lenses. Why do you think that?

The main reason for distortion of the GearVR mod on the Vive (Pro) is that the lens is not perfectly flat or centered.

No annoying wire tugging as I move, beautiful OLED screen , vibrant colors, deep blacks, very little screen door and very comfortable.

"I need to clear to some things up. To call any part of Boneworks an engine is not accurate. Boneworks is made in Unity. Unity uses PhysX, a ""physics engine"", instead of writing it's own from scratch like a lot of engines do. Unreal also  uses the PhysX sdk.  


Yes SL0 put a ton of custom work into making the body, enemies, and item interactions but it is not an engine. They mentioned releasing an sdk/toolkit/asset, what have you a while ago but made it clear it wouldn't be until quite a while after boneworks was released if at all.  


Supporting a sdk like this wold be a ton of work. The people using the tools for boneworks are likely the ones who built them. Or at least have someone who built it in the chair next to them . Making the tool streamlined enough for an inexperienced solo developer could take a lot of time. Writing documentation and keeping it updated will take a lot of time. Answering support emails, recording tutorials, submitting builds for review, keeping it up to date with Unity etc will all take massive amounts of time. I'm pretty sure studios will want a good game under their belt before they expend the resources to support a toolkit.",Vive
"I have a couple of Vive Pro Wireless kits after just getting into the VR game  3 months ago, give or take.

&amp;#x200B;

First exposure was a friend with an OG Vive on wireless getting some seat time in Elite Dangerous.  He is the one who got me in and as a result we run the same HOTAS and have a similar setup.  Loved it.

&amp;#x200B;

Second friend hadn't mentioned but he came across a steal of a deal on a Dell Visor and I ended up putting a fair bit of time in on that Windows MR headset.  It's great.

&amp;#x200B;

I waited for a while after the Valve Index launched to see if they were going to announce any sort of wireless adapter as VR seated with the wire, turns out, is borderline unusable where standing and room scale its fine by me.  Since I play ED... wired simply wasn't an option so after I got tired of waiting for an INdex Wireless announcement I picked up a couple of Vive Pros + Wireless so me and the nieces and nephew could all play.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I recommend?  Take a long look at the Samsung Odyssey on sale right now from Amazon.   Amazon may be the devil in important ways but their return policy simplifies test drving out that set.  Although I haven't used it personally I know it to use the same displays as my Vive Pros at a fraction of the cost.  I personally have no problems with WIndows MR tracking in the likes of Beat Saber.  If it a little different and a little off of Lighthouse tracking?  Sure but it isn't going to ruin the experience and if you are unintiated you won't notice the difference is my guess.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are willing to spend some coin the Index is the other place where I would point you if wireless isn't a consideration.

&amp;#x200B;

HTC's support is legendarily shit.  Don't do the Cosmos unless you get some sort of iron-clad return ability and what you've read doesn't put you off of the idea.  My friend who exposed me to the OG Vive + wireless has one and he says it is fine (haven't tried it out personally) but does admit it bugs out infrequently.  There are a lot of anecdotes about problems and then there is that support I opened this paragraph off with the consider.

If you haven't used wireless and thus don't have that difference ingrained yet absolutely grab the index.",Vive

What's your IPD? I keep thinking about trying it out but I hear that people with low IPDs have issues with it. Mine's around 58.,Vive

"I mean, the vive pro had real issues when it came out. Maybe you didn't get it at release so you didn't notice, but the sound issues that it had for like nearly a year were absolutely infuriating. It *still* does a stupid thing with turning on the controllers (which of course doesn't matter if you are using index controllers instead). Switching back and forth from wireless to wired is unnecessarily cumbersome. And the wireless doesn't work flawlessly unless you cool it, which means giving up the usb port. Oh, and all of the issues with the bandwidth while using the camera. I'll admit that the OG vive had that issue too, but I'd be surprised if the index does. 

But the real problem is the price. It is WAY overpriced. I bought mine on a mistaken deal where it was nearly half off (it was around $900 total counting shipping for the pro, the 2.0 basestations, and the controllers when the kit was normally selling for $1600) , and I still think that was barely worth it as an upgrade from the og vive + DAS. I agree that it is better because of wireless, but if it weren't for wireless I would have upgraded to the index and let the pro gather dust.",Vive
Oh thanks I'll look into those. Already have superhot,Vive
"The physics engine is not developed in-house by Boneworks--they are using physx and as I understand it they have only made some minor changes to the actual physics engine.  At that level, it's more that they needed to have a very low level understanding of physx and rigid body dynamics across the entire team.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Not saying what they have done is a small feat.  Rather, my understand is that what they have been working on are physics based mechanics on a much more granular and general level, and in a way that's optimized for VR (for which it's particularly well suited and perhaps necessary due to VR's much higher fidelity interface to the virtual world).  To achieve this in a performant and physically stabile way has required a rethink and rewrite of many engine subsystems.  In addition, they needed to rethink how to approach gameplay design within this kind of system and minimize clunkiness.  
&amp;nbsp;  
By defining almost everything at a much more granular level (and generally across) the same physics simulation, it allows all of the interactions, the environment/objects, the AI, the player's virtual body, etc etc to behave in a physically consistent way, from which much more dynamic and interesting behaviors can emerge.  The end result is that one can use the affordances of VR to more naturally express their agency over a much larger space of potential interactivity.  This is as opposed to the typical flat game design where you're given a small set of preprogrammed interactions (e.g. quick time events) to play with, but anything that is not encompassed by those higher level interactions are inaccessible to you.

"Yeah, I definitely picked up the index controllers to use with my pro, I'd say they are worth it. The issue that most of us seem to be having with wireless has nothing to do with the computer.

Many people solve that issue by attaching a large fan to the receiver, which apparently works.

"I live in an apartment so I feel your pain on the no wall damage policy. its stupid but when tenants go through the room every 1-3 years its also understandable.

i personally went with the cheapest solution I could when i set mine up. I read a bunch of people saying to avoid the adhesive strip solution but after having mine set up for 2+ years in this apartment I can say that it works so long as you know what you are doing.

the reason why 3m strips don't get a better recommendation from the community is because people use them wrong. the inside of the wall mounts is hollow so the strips themselves have nothing to stick to. I found a discarded corrugated plastic sign and cut it to size (a little bigger than the wall mounts) and then bought some nylon screws and bolts and used those to attach the wall mount to the piece of plastic. from there a set of 3 Velcro 3m strips mounts them securely to the wall. 

I opted for the Velcro strips so I could move a light house around if I wanted to. I play some driving games with my wheel and its less of a hassle to move a 1 lbs light house rather than an 20lbs chair (and cables and keyboard+mouse) so I just attach the light house to the wall over my monitor and reset the system to seated. another benefit of Velcro strips is that they are disposable enough you could buy a set if you ever wanted to take your vive somewhere and quickly mount it to a wall without the song and dance of finding something tall enough to rest the light house on.

hope this idea helps!",Vive
"I don't see how taking longer is an indication of this being a tech demo. At all. Games take forever to make and even longer when they're doing something experimental. It stands to reason if they did successfully work all of the ""jumbled mess"" of mechanics into a full narrative campaign it would've taken much longer than just releasing the vertical slice sandbox mode. Which has already been confirmed for launch. If anything taking longer is an indication this isn't a tech demo.

Whether or not Boneworks campaign makes full use of the mechanics they've spent all this time working on is close to pure speculation. Claiming one way or the other doesn't really make sense. Of course Alyx looks way more impressive on the story side of things. But that's not to say Boneworks won't have a good narrative. What world would we live in if Boneworks had a better looking narrative than a new Half Life game? I'm hopeful but obviously there is a ton of skepticism that I think is way overblown at this point. I could be wrong but it seems pretty clear to me SL0 is trying to say as little as possible about the story.

"in the US, you can sell locally on Offerup. Perfect condition OG VIVE should sell for $300USD, more easily if you have the box probably and include all your Vive-specific accessories. I personally wouldn't list it any higher because as a buyer I think I would rather save up a little more for a Quest or Rift S.

However, if you are only selling the headset and wands and are keeping the base stations, then I think it would be a good idea to sell them separately, $150-200USD for the headset and $80-100USD for the controllers, whatever you're comfortable with in those ranges.",Vive

The black levels didn't bother me at all. The image clarity and increased FOV was a huge upgrade. The headphones overall quality didn't feel like a massive jump over the DAS but just not having them physically on your ears was a much bigger upgrade than I expected. Being able to hear yourself talk clearly is just so much nicer.",Vive

They usually complain that ""sliding"" is just so immersive for them and they can't understand how unimmersive teleportation is even acceptable.

I originally was just going to get the controllers for about $300, but by selling stuff and making $300 I end up coming out of Pocket $450 for an Index HMD &amp; Controllers be $300 for the controllers alone.

I can't do it until they release a wireless adapter for the Index.,Vive

I'm running a GTX 1080ti so I'm hoping to be fine. Don't plan on adding another expense with a new processor.",Vive
"The Vive Pro isn't bad. It was just horrendously overpriced when it came out. I mean, it's good but it's not good enough to warrant such a crazy price increase. The res is higher and it has a rigid head strap, but besides that it's not much of an upgrade from the Vive.",Vive
I dont recommend the index because the controllers have poor QC. Ever have trackpad button failure on the original vive wands? The index controller has the joystick as a common point of failure. Took me 2 months of use to have joysticks begin drifting.,Vive
"If you care a lot about OLED colors, I'd recommend a Pimax 5k XR. It has 1440p OLED screens, and a super large fov. It has no wireless (although it's planned) but the optics are quite a bit better. It doesn't come with a rigid headstrap, but a Vive DAS can be fitted onto it with an adapter. The Pimax has some drawbacks though. For some, there is some image distortion. It's subjective though, so the amount you experience depends on the person. Pimax is releasing their own rigid headstrap and a new foam piece for their headsets. From what I've heard they seem to help distortion by better positioning the headset on your face.",Vive
"The Index doesn't need a lens mod though, and I prefer it to the lens mod as you don't have the adapters touching your face at the closest setting and you don't lose FOV from the adapters.  I also regularly had to remove the adapters to remove dust on the screen.  Wireless is the only reason but that will be released for Index eventually.",Vive
"That should be okay, I'm running a 2070 anyways with a light DE.",Vive
Depends what you like about the index. If it's just the controllers then keep the vive and just buy the controllers. If it's the headset then get that one. It's only up to you to decide if the money is worth it,Vive
I dont think there is simulated turning but a lot of the level design is staying in one spot. Occasionally there are enemies behind you i think. Cloudlands mini golf is one handed with simulated turning,Vive
"I totally agree, I'd never go back to my Pro unless my Index was broken.  If you could get a used Pro for half-price then the comparison starts to make sense.",Vive
With moving house recently I haven't played VR or kept up to date with it for about 9 months. Are the new controllers a big step forward?,Vive
"Yes, as long as you can flail your arms around and bend down to pick things up it will work.  For longer games I usually sit on a swivel chair anyways and only really move around a lot in some games like Budget Cuts.",Vive
Lol we joined reddit on the same day,Vive
"Im fucking beyond excited for VR shit right now and none of my friends play VR so i seem like im a crazed hyper fan. Boneworks looks amazing, alyx looks amazing. Im hyped to use knuckles in a game like hotdogs horseshoes and hand grenades, vr chat too, everything is getting me hype at this point.",Vive
"Oh wow! That's a huge difference in black levels. I feel like I'd get used to it if I was in it, but looking at the comparison is astounding. Was that a cost cutting measure?",Vive
"What gpu / cpu u running? I'm in the same scenario as you, got a 1070 and 2600 but im a little worried how it would run with the index headset",Vive
I’m pretty sure the devs confirmed there won’t be support for extra trackers.,Vive
"Oh ok, thank you very much!",Vive
You can download a free checker through steam. I forget the name offhand but it’s in Tools,Vive
"The Steam VR test is here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/323910/SteamVR_Performance_Test/

"Really/ You only have a 400mm square that you can call a playspace.

A chair won't fit in that.",Vive
Nobody used Valve's renderer because it has zero post-release support.,Vive
"haha, fair enough. I actually don't feel the heat but do get the issues, which is a weird point of distinction.",Vive
It's basically better blacks from oled vs better resolution and less screen door on the index. After using the vive less screen door effect is very tempting. I can't say I have heard of anyone who has tried both say they prefer the vive for it's picture .,Vive
"Linus likes it. https://youtu.be/6p1e_JSol8s

[Is it possible to buy a Vive without the controllers?](/r/Vive/comments/e14nbu/is_it_possible_to_buy_a_vive_without_the/) by  cloudpersonn


Hi everyone! Been planning on taking the dive into VR recently, however I'm having some issues so far. What I'm looking at doing is buying a Vive headset, and then the Vive basestations, and then buy the Index controllers as I really, really want the full finger tracking support, however I can't find a Vive without the controllers anywhere. Can anyone give some suggestions or pointers?

"The vive pro is definitely better than the Rift S, though probably not as far as value, which may be what you were referring to.",Vive
"Hi there. I see you still have your issue. You can see what is happening when the program tries to open by opening the event viewer (hit the windows key on your keyboard and then type ""event"" and you should see the Event Viewer app in the search results) open it and look under both applications and security for any events at the time you tried to open Viveport.exe. It should report what was happening and give some error code that should tell you what is failing. On the right are ""actions"" and ""create custom views"" use that to filter the logs a bit  if they are too overwhelming eg. critical and error and the last hour (assuming that you tried to run it in the last hour) This should give you some progress towards what is going on with you PC.",Vive
Considering I was going to get HL:A that’s just 60 bucks off the controllers,Vive
"I'd consider buying a used original vive setup for like $250 or whatever you can find it for. That will get you basestations and controllers meaning that when you decide to take the $500 plunge on the index you won't need to spend the other $500. Or, you could get that full setup and grab the index controllers and still stay under the $580 that you'd spend on the cosmos or quest. Ultimately, those two devices *are* better in like 90% of ways than the OG vive, though the tracking on the vive is still better. However, if you have a beefy enough graphics card you can supersample the vive into being not much worse visually than the cosmos / quest. And ultimately, just getting in on steam vr tracking for cheap is going to allow you piecemeal upgrade to whatever you want in the future.",Vive

What's the GearVR mod?,Vive
Nothing has left my local dev environment yet. I'll circle back in the coming weeks if I have anything notable or fun,Vive
"Hell yeah man. If you have the finances to get them, take the plunge!",Vive
"What kind?  Mostly entry-level PCVR.

It may struggle with newer demanding games and will likely need to reproject frames even at lower settings although it will probably be OK for older/less demanding VR games.  It's also going to depend on what HMD you buy.  Don't pick a high resolution HMD like the Index.

Your video card is the most important part of the PC when it comes to VR. A GTX 970 is pretty much the minimum recommended card for the OG Vive or Rift CV-1; upgrading it will give you a better VR experience later on.",Vive
"I've just bought Valve Index while already owning the original Vive. Here's what I can tell:

1) Image is _definitely_ sharper and it makes a difference. You now can look into the distance and enjoy the view, rather than strain your eyes. I'm at last able to appreciate my fully modded Skyrim and I'm blown away.
2) It sits less firmly on the head, or you have to loosen upper strip a lot and tighten the back, which kinda makes your head hurt. And I don't want to sweat in it. So I decided to keep my original Vive for sport games and other more active/sweaty ones. Beat Saber/ Pistol Whip. Graphics is not so important for those ones.
3) Knuckles are so amazing. Not having to hold controllers is important. I also expected to be able to throw things better, but it is still kinda awkward.
4) That said, they wave reduced range of motion: because now controller movement = your hand movement. Before it was controller movement = hand movement +movement of controller in your hand. That makes a difference, again, in Beat Saber.

Overall, I would say that it's definitely worth it. Now playing any game I feel like I'm getting the full experience and don't have this thought in the back of my mind that I wish there just were more pixels.",Vive
"Swapping the Vive (or Vive Pro) lens with GearVR lens. You get edge to edge clarity and massively reduce God rays.

The disadvantage is increased pupil swim.",Vive
"Somehow I've got better performance with Index in some games than with Vive, despite the higher resolution.. And with 120 HZ - you can have ~60 FPS + reprojection and that feels better than 80+reprojection on Vive.",Vive
That comparison is a recreation and I don't think it fairly represents the difference.,Vive

"I made this same mistake my friend.  I did not do my research.  I enjoy Cosmos and the image and screen door effect is much better yes but not worth it for the pain, hassle, time and money.  I never heard of Revive before.   Its not even a official program.  

Its just made by some dudes.  lol  

So um yea there is no games for Steam VR at all.  Oculus has them all.  Mostly I mean.  All the good ones anyways.  It might change in the future yes, yes...  Revive does make it work yes, yes but its a pain in the neck let me say.  You have to wait for it to be updated for it to work with new games.  I am still unable to play Stormland.  Its Oculus only and I am not hooking up my Rift CV1 just to play it.  

I bought Cosmos and cant return it so... 

Stick with Oculus all the way.   Until further notice.  I have to have Oculus and Steam and Steam VR and Vive dashport and some other link box utility program plus Revive just to get it to work.  Thats a lot.",Vive
"I don’t think there will be a different version of these for at least a generation. Maybe they will upgrade some internals or whatever but yeah, these are here to stay for at least the next 3-5 years I would think",Vive
"This. Even with the DAS comfort was always an issue with the Vive for me, especially the heat and after hearing that the index gets even hotter I was very reluctant to get it but I still pulled the trigger after the HLA trailer. It's such a massive difference. I can actually play for an hour without even thinking of removing the headset.   
Everything but the black levels is an upgrade as well and they don't bother me nearly as much as I thought they would. Awesome headset overall.",Vive
"Yeah I’m going to use this to justify the purchase lol, waiting for Black Friday just incase there’s an extra discount",Vive
"Agreed, I to do love the flip up and I get small light leak at nose.",Vive
"Thanks for the feedback, you're probably right - If I did it, it'd mostly be for the fun of it, more than actual practicality.",Vive
"I haven't used either, but I looked at the prices yesterday, and the Index headset is almost half the price of the Vive Pro headset. It's about £450 for Index and £800 (!!!) for the Vive Pro. Madness. I thought they would cost similar amounts. Is this the same in other regions?

It's a bit annoying that you would have to choose between colours and effective resolution, but I think effective resolution makes a pretty big difference. Even without the extra pixels, supersampling makes a huge difference.

Can anyone really justify nearly double the price for what seems like, at best, a sidegrade to the Index? I see people mentioning wireless, but that's more money still.",Vive
"As you physically move your eyes around you are looking through the lens at a different angle/position which affect distortion. So basically you see like things expand and contract as you look around. 

You can engineer a lens to minimize pupil swim but it generally comes at the expense of other problems like increased god rays and smaller ""sweet spot"".

The GearVR lens have a larger sweet spot and less god rays but less then optimal pupil swim. it's all a trade off. Valve seems to believe pupil swim is worse than other aspects as it often can make you sick even if you don't notice it.",Vive
Happy cake day bro,Vive
"thank you for replying but uh i somehow fixed it today and was using vr for the whole day so everything works perfectly.

"I tried the Vive cosmos and luckily returned it quickly enough. The sweet spot was so annoying to get right on my head. Sad because the screen was really sharp and and had minimal sde.

 I’ll give the tracking the benefit of the doubt that it will get better. 

I can imagine with modded optics it will be pretty nice. I’m just not willing to go out of my way to do all that.

But yeah, the sweet spot drove me crazy.

HTC really dropped the ball on this headset, I’m going with a quest and link cable because I travel. 

I’m sure the headset will get better with updates and software.",Vive
That's good news can you tell us how it was fixed as that would help people?,Vive
To you as well,Vive
"I to preorder Cosmos and own Rift cv1 3 sensors.  I am thinking about buying the wireless rig. 

I agree that tracking is getting better each update and I honestly dont have many problems once in game and everythings working.  I cant tell much of bad tracking. 

The headset fits me great and flip up is awesome.  Plus you can hit a button and activate the cameras which is awesome.  

Not having sensors and miles of cord on top of already miles of cords is awesome.

I just do not like the fact that exclusive titles and this crap sucks.  I have a hard time with Revive and usually have to wait for updates for new games.  Some of my Oculus titles dont work and some due.  Dirt 2 doesnt detect my steering wheel logitech and pedals.  Dealing with all the keybind is crazy.  Plus I have to keep Oculus open or atleast installed and updated.  Just a mess imo.

But Cosmos is not all that bad as a headset guys. Just wish things was differant or officially compatible with official support.  Without Revive which some dude made then why even buy anything other then Oculus?",Vive
"You probably pulled out the internal ribbon cable that connects the tracking sensors to the controller. I've done it three times on GORN. You need to take the controller apart and reconnect the ribbon cable, then click and screw it all back together.

Be careful and take it slow. If you are too hasty, you might snap off a sensor or rip a cable somewhere. Watch a teardown video before doing it. Try ifixit.

It should be the thick two-part ribbon cable in this image, next to the right index finger.

"Comfort, resolution, FOV, are all greatly improved, the downside is OLED to LCD gets you dark grey instead of black, most noticeable on space games.  With a 1080 Ti you will be fine unless you crank up the settings, also steam reprojection is not as smooth as the rifts space warp.",Vive
why not just rebind using steam input for handedness issues??,Vive
"The headset is also worth it, but if you're strapped for cash the controllers are enough. You can keep your 1.0 base stations, but then you can't sell your Vive (which would probably go for 350 max). I still use my Vive wands for Beat Saber and the rare title that can't work with knuckles at all.",Vive

"Don't listen to them, I've been using Linux for about 22 years and it's very good.",Vive
"Is it really so bad? My main beef with wands is how easy it is to hit them with one another and there's basically nothing but the touchpad, lots of unused space that could accomodate extra buttons. I spent majority of my time in Pavlov moving with wands, I didn't really hate it, looking back.",Vive
"To me, it was a worth it, but this is going to be a matter of your budget.

I'll put it like this: **If** you have the PC strong enough to take advantage of 120 Hz, and **if** you can afford to upgrade both headset and the controllers together, then yes - this is worth it. The combination of greatly improved resolution (seriously, it's almost night and day from the Vive) with the increased immersion of the controllers gets you very close to what we all hope for in next generation VR tech.

I don't believe upgrading just the controllers or just the headseat is quite worth it, though. On their own, they're incremental upgrades that are nice, but probably something you could wait longer for. Together, though, they make it a GREAT upgrade.... if you've got the money.",Vive

I'd say Vive Pro with wireless adapter over the Index. If you know you're not going wireless then the Index is probably the better choice.,Vive
"With the thin VR cover, the Vive Pro's FOV can be pretty close to the Index.",Vive
[deleted],Vive
Cool...TIA for any sharing...,Vive
"Doesn't the wireless run at a lower resolution than native on the pro?

Or did they fix that?",Vive
It won't stay connect to Steam. There is no memory in the Vive.,Vive
"Yeah, they're not really 'bad' strictly speaking. I guess it's more based on what other people keep saying, and my constant desire to do things myself",Vive
"Kijiji is your friend.  Plenty if sellers now that Index is out and more chances if you post your own ""wanted"" as...",Vive
"Just tested it and what a wonderfull experience! I really loved all the attention to details and hidden ""easter eggs"" here and there :D

Lots of work and passion was put into this, it really inspired me with the overall historical information and the VR mechanics! Very few vr educational experiences can give us that!",Vive
"Just to add to the possible association to Valve as a whole.  I do not believe this is secretly a valve game, however, it's quite possible that this is a crucial test for Valve, in that, it is going to be the first real VR title with fully realized physicality.  I think Valve will be closely attentive to the reception this has, maybe even incorporating ""full-body"" physics into alyx, before release, depending on this test.  I think they have a lot they can learn from this title, given how similar it feels to half-life as well.

Just an idea.",Vive
"Unlikely. The Index just launched in two new markets (Canada and Japan) and they're having trouble keeping everything except the full kit in stock, wouldn't be much reason for a discount at this point.",Vive
"Oh I know, it’s just wishful thinking hahah",Vive
Adjust the head strap to make it shorter.,Vive
Why do you have 3 GPUs,Vive
Are you using the Delux Audio Strap or that elastic thing that comes with the Vive?,Vive
So the finger tracking and all that works fine with 1.0 stations and vive hmd?,Vive
[deleted],Vive
"All functionality is present.  What the developers do with it (finger tracking) is another story.

But yes Everything works with OG base stations and hmd.",Vive
"SOLD, lol. I want these so bad for hla and boneworks",Vive
"God no. The Vive is pretty awful after getting used to the Index. The black levels are certainly different, but no where near enough to overcome the difference in image quality.",Vive
That’s a great idea. You’ll basically get everything brand new for $500.,Vive
I've almost sorted out all of my through-the-wall extension cable issues. I'm sure once I have that figured out they will announce a wireless kit to make my efforts obsolete.,Vive
how about replacing the battery?,Vive
"If your intent is to have the PC in another room, wireless wouldn't work for you anyways. The Vive wireless adapter requires an antenna pointed directly at your play space and I don't think you'd be able to extend its coaxial cable long enough into another room with out degrading the signal.",Vive
My pc is in the room directly above my playspace. So if I could just run the cable to the center of the room (in between the floor joists) and ceiling mount it then that would be fantastic.,Vive
"I've got 4 batteries and all do the same thing.  Two HTC, two non HTC.",Vive
Delux audio!,Vive
Is that the top loop or is it the knob on the back of my head?,Vive
"So your actual playspace is about 1.5 x 1.5 then? Honestly, I wouldn't even bother with that setup. It's going to be more grief than it's worth. You're just going to end up hitting things, which won't be good. 

If you want to play seated VR games, maybe, but in that case don't bother with a Vive, just get a Samsung Odyssey+ or a Lenovo Explorer.",Vive
How’s the finger tracking? Does it just detect if you’re gripping?,Vive
"There's nothing you can do, but for what it's worth, you should be able to learn to just ignore them. 

What's even more terrifying is you can get floaters and stuff in your actual eye, which affects your vision all the time (not caused by VR, just saying it can happen), and you just have to learn to ignore those too.",Vive
The stock cable for the wireless adapter antenna is like 3-4 feet.,Vive
Yep,Vive
"If you hold the controller at the “right” angle, it detects each finger for about 3-4 leveled of extension.  The “grip” button is more pressure than travel, and covers 2/3 of the underside of the controller; in place of the vice grip hutton",Vive
i3wm is awesome. It's really nice on laptops because it's lightweight and can help you make more of screen real estate without having to move hand to mouse. Couple it with vim and it's pretty awesome (I code a lot). Never have to move hand from keys again.,Vive
"For what you described, start by shortening the top loop; and then you turn the knob at the back to bring it close enough to your face that it stays put when you turn your head.",Vive
"I did this upgrade. 

The HMD is a great upgrade. Resolution wise it is like going from SD to HD for those of you old enough to remember that transition. It is very noticeable. 

FOV is another upgrade, although to be honest I don't notice horizontal FOV all that much, but vertical FOV is a huge improvement. 

Sound is the third big change. The new speakers are amazing. 

The controllers are better than the wands, but still not supported natively by too many games, and so that makes them a little fiddly to find the right bindings. But overall definitely an improvement.",Vive
"Ouch, so that would just be mounted at the top corner of the room then...",Vive
When you find a post that sums up your near exact thoughts but in a much more eloquent way.. have a gold!,Vive
"I would say not yet. I too have a brand new Vive and I feel like its a huge waste of money to buy the index now. I bought the controllers, and you should too, but for the headset wait for the price to drop.",Vive
"Just pause your game and use Shadow play? I agree tho, there should be a button you can map on the headset itself",Vive
Yeah like replacing the screenshot button with a record the last 30 seconds,Vive
"Currently have my Vive setup in my apartment living room, which is adjacent to my bedroom with my PC. In the living room is my TV, two couches, and my Vive lighthouses. 

On the two opposite corners I have these extendable spring loaded poles I purchased from Amazon. 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IF5SY1E/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_87Y2DbXVJ2P9P

I adjusted the tension so its a tight fit from floor to th ceiling. 

On the top of those poles are my lighthouses pointing towards the middle of the living room. The lighthouses are mounted onto the pole using these attachable clamps.

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E5M39AW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_q5Y2Db59XQ0TV

They've been there stable since May of this year.",Vive
"i think given the sheer number of vive owners who pulled the trigger on the index controllers after the Alyx trailer, there would be a riot if there was a black Friday deal. seems unlikely.",Vive
Losing the goggles and low res could be worth it for ya,Vive
"Bluetooth just turns off the basestations when not being used.  IMO it is easier to turn them off manually with a switch, or unplug them.  Even when bluetooth does work it breaks almost every patch.",Vive
"Yeah most likely right, maybe there will be some discount on steam cards somewhere or something? Can you even pay with a steam balance for index items?",Vive
"Personally, the controllers are worth upgrading.

The headset wasn't worth it for me, as I use a pimax; but going from vive wands to pimax controllers was a big jump in games that supported them.",Vive
"Personally, I would love to see Valve add a locomotion classification to the Steam store where it shows other VR specs like tracked motion controls, standing/roomscale etc. I think it would be a godsend for people who have strong feelings one way or another about the types of locomotion they enjoy in VR.",Vive
"Does skyrim work with the little joystick or do you still end up with the teeny touchpad for slide movement (or NaLo)?

I always thought the joystick would solve a lot of motion sickness .. ie if you get sick from the slide motion bs your ears that just takes getting used to. But the devs never do the slide movement right - they make it relative to center of the pad instead of centering where you first touch that moment. So if your thumb lands a little off, theres no deadzone.. you lurch forward or back. Puke city for me. 

So i use NaLo but figure the stick will be way more awesome. 

And can give dragons the finger? Someday :)",Vive
The DAS has a velcro strap at the top to adjust.,Vive
"If you're unaware, the story of the game is that you're inside a defective OS and those enemies are effectively glitches/bugs that you're encountering so they're supposed to look like they're a graphical glitch.",Vive
"I couldn’t answer ref Skyrim, as I don’t play it.

The joystick helps me significantly; if I’m holding the controller aligned properly that is.  Only had success with the left/locomotion stick.  The turning on the right hand side gets...a bit much.",Vive
It is completely worth it and the difference will blow you away.  Maybe you can get as much as 300 for the headset with all the standard accessories.  I poked around ebay a bit.  HTC is selling certified refurbished ones for $400,Vive
"How do you turn? Touchpad touching? 

I imagine things like pavlov would be way way better with knuckles. 

Can’t wait for mine to show up",Vive
How much do you want and what would be included?,Vive
"I turn my body (when able).

With wireless it’s glorious.

I keep tellin people the OG vive is fine... once you get all the fixings :)",Vive
"I like the tabbed mode a lot since I use most of my applications in full screen mode, after discovering that it's been really great. The only parts I don't like are no GUI configuration for i3, i3bar or the alternative polybar.",Vive
ive worked many times on my OG vive in VR desktop,Vive
"One of them is my iGPU though nvidia's drivers refuse to pass through to it, and I can't seem to enable my X screen for my 970 so I have to plug all of my monitors into my 2070, Nvidia's X driver sucks. That along with the inability to create the custom resolution I need for my main monitor to reach 75hz outside of fiddling with config files. As for the two discrete ones, it really helps blender.",Vive
Doing the same. Ordered full index kit to flip my Vive to someone deserving who wants to play Alyx.  Probably will see if a friend or acquaintance at work wants it. If I can get $600 Cdn for the entire kit I’ll be happy.  Just spend $2k on the index and my associated PC upgrades to make sure I’m 100% Alyx ready.,Vive
"I don't think it's worth it right now. 

I even bought a pimax and re-sold it since the vive pro blacks and colors look so much better.

I'd wait for a price drop or better tech. Upgrading from an OG vive I would say the vive pro is worth it IF you can get it for 500 or less.

The controllers are 100% worth it though.",Vive
I paid 400 for mine because I couldn't wait. Worth every penny.,Vive
I'm not trying to turn them off. I'm trying to get the damn thing to pair in the FIRST place.,Vive
"every game ""works"" with them but not a lot of games are optimized to take advantage of all the finger tracking though.",Vive
"Swapping lenses out for gearvr lenses.

Some people like it, I didn't.

You lose some of the magic depth perception that is the entire point of VR.",Vive
"I refunded my Index. Pro with lens mod is a MUCH better visual experience. Skyrim night walks or sim night racing were ruined by the Index, at least for me anyway as I am so used to OLED.",Vive
"Yeah, it's definitely not AS bad as it looks in the video, but it is a big difference when comparing the vive pro. Was a deal breaker for me.",Vive
"VS OG Vive yeah index is a clear winner, but I wouldn't pay full price for an LCD upgrade.",Vive
"When I got the game at launch it was the grip buttons. I got super used to it, and then there was an update that changed the buttons. You were able to download an alternate build that had the grip buttons rebound.

And yeah that setting in Pavlov was just DUMB.",Vive
Just imagine if it had an alternate ending every time and different extra deleted scenes throughout each time you watched it.,Vive
Does anyone know if there will be any Black Friday deal on these or should I just buy them?,Vive
"Hey, I don't use Unity but do the index controllers trigger the Motion controller grip events? I know that the gripping is different on the index controllers.",Vive
"To be more precise, its an Intel Core i5-6400, and I updated my drivers today while trying to fix this.  The strangest thing is that I’ve used this pc with my vive for 3 years, so I have a feeling its a software issue",Vive
"Looking at the bottom pic, I'd un-peal the bottom till just over half way round the curve and then replace and simply velcro the foam slightly further out all the way round.

also, not sure if it's my imagination, in the top image is the left h/d side higher than the right?

I've found the easiest way for me is to find the top middle of the face cover (fold in half if needed) press that to the center at the top and then adjust the rest in/out slightly to suit so I don't have the corners of the face pad digging into my nose when I get to the end.",Vive
I haven't gotten the chance to watch the video yet but does it sound like something like a VR Garry's Mod would be possible?,Vive
"Any idea if the occlusion of wearing the index controllers causes tracking issues with the leap motion?
One of the most entertaining things to do with full hand tracking is make very intricate rude gestures in Cards Against Humanity games.",Vive
"I totally move my index controllers, being able to let go ans relax my hands is luxary, finger and force tracking is quite sweet aswell!",Vive
Garry's mod the game is making a game. Valve has created an engine and tools to make games easier. They didn't go into great detail but I assume its similar to what they've always had for their engines just with VR compatibility and assets from the new game.,Vive
Yes.,Vive
"it would make the experience worse, it would just show that they didn't have a true ending to the story in their mind, they'd be padding out time just for the sake of padding out time, to make it seem like you're getting value just out of the time you have to put into it rather than it being a solid experience, a story someone genuinely wanted to tell.

long multiplayer experiences are good but not everything has to be that, some things can just be short and sweet.",Vive
"Yes, I use Knuckles with my Vive. They also will work with Pimax and the HTC Vive Cosmos if you purchase  the SteamVR tracking face place thingy.",Vive
"I seriously doubt the linkbox would cause tracking instability. However, there is a simple test to rule it out. You can plug the USB and HDMI parts of the 3:1 cable directly into your PC thus only using the linkbox for power.

Also, when you tried to use your sync cable did you properly switch your base stations to A and B mode instead of B and C?

Typically the gray flashes are caused by something in your play space reflecting your base stations. So if you have any mirrors, windows, or shiny surfaces you might want cover them. It also could just a USB issue. Try using a different port on your PC. USB 2 if you have it as USB 3 controllers are known to be finicky sometimes.",Vive
"I was wondering about that too.  Maybe the games are being worked on by different teams, and Robin didn't want to say ""Next, we'll be pitching in on finishing a thing that I can't tell you about"".  Or maybe the other two games didn't work out and have been shelved.  I hope that Robin was just speaking for the HLA team and the other games are still on their ways, but I'm optimistic like that.

As far as I know, they haven't officially walked back the ""3 full games"" statement.  Maybe someone should ask Gabe.",Vive
"No, but given how many people have been involved in this I would imagine they don't have the bandwidth to push them all out simultaneously. The other two are probably not as far along in development.",Vive
"Why take the wind from Half Life Alyx's sails? We know from HL:A that they've been working on these games for a while. They don't appear to be low effort toy boxes. So we can reasonably expect that they'd take a fair amount of effort - on the order of years to build each.

Which also means that we can totally expect them to launch their 3 games staggered across the space of months and years.

Which means, why talk about a game that'll launch soon and 2 games that'll launch in years... when they can get the maximum interest and exposure for the want that'll launch soon and then do the same again another 2 times when the other 2 are ready to launch?",Vive

It's right click on the game and select properties and the image shown in your link is the first tab of the properties window when it opens.,Vive
HTC puts off this passive aggressive vibe like they never wanted to get into VR but they fell into it through circumstance and now they are mad at the world and all their customers.,Vive
"For the average user, the outter shell is rather sturdy.",Vive
"You can still buy the basic Vive in various countries, plus they have started selling the reconditioned basic Vive and they are now doing the Vive Pro ""Starter Kit"" for £850, which is all brand new, vive pro with v1.0 wands &amp; lighthouses, so it's cheaper than the Index and you can still upgrade to the knuckles later if you wish.",Vive
"I discovered that you must have a PCIe 3.0 slot or it won't give you full resolution. So if you have older hardware check first.

Also wireless is CPU intensive so older CPUs that were working hard on just the game will melt encoding the wireless video stream also.",Vive

I thought I was done with gaming, to the point that I thought I was going to switch to Linux on my next machine and forget about gaming.

Now this.

Clearly, I'm not done with gaming. Clearly, I'm finally making the jump into VR. This is just too enticing for me to pass up. All it took was watching the first 30 seconds of the ad and I made my decision.",Vive

"Relax, not only is Alex a third of the work for those games done, but no company talks about the next games when they’re announcing the first.",Vive
"Don’t forget the level editor, Hammer, and SDK, which will likely allow some serious modding of the game. That’s where most of Valve’s published games started in the past and we can expect a lot of community mods. Hopefully the SDK allows for multiplayer with the mods, and a wide range of things can be made.",Vive
"If you noticed a problem after going wireless then the CPU is the problem, not the GPU. The CPU is not able to keep up with the compression workload. The reason you are probably seeing pulsating blurriness is because the CPU didn't manage to compress the frame in time and you ended up with a blurry partially pixilated frame. 

However another thing that can cause that is poor signal strength between the transmitter and the wireless receiver. Make sure you mount the transmitter above your playspace, angled down. HTC's instructions to attach it to your monitor is very bad advice. So, I'd certainly look into that as well.

Assuming it's the first problem though, the fix is to get a faster CPU. Technically a faster GPU will also slightly improve things, because if the GPU finishes the frame faster it allows more time for the CPU to compress. Likewise lowering super sampling can help for the same reason. But in the end the CPU is the major problem of not being able to keep up with the compression.",Vive

I really do hope they give it a proper try. There are people who find it extremely hard to get motion sick anymore due to playing vr for a long time now. There will only be more people who are able to actually play it as time goes on.

"I'm constantly thinking how vr has rejuvenated my excitement for gaming. It's very hard for a flat game to break the mould and do anything that innovative anymore, so even with the amount of games coming out now its has been feeling kind of stale for a while. I found myself mainly playing things like rocket league and overwatch and only in little cos now and then.   
The complete opposite for is true for vr. Almost every game feels new and interesting just from the feeling of being somewhere new each time, and then there are the mechanics which are all fresh in vr.
I've been playing for the last two and a half years and I'm still not bored but am always excited thinking of what's next and how fast it is developing.

I would only be using it for the full vr modes. And what I played always had a low fps even with a decent rig. I was just wondering if it had improved recently. I haven't been that bothered since playing the GTA V mod without vorpx and seeing how much better games can run. I'll try it myself again at some point.,Vive
odd. I have a 6600 and it seems to work fine for me. consider reinstalling steamvr ir updating it if there is one available,Vive

VR is what brought back the excitement for games. Partly, because it almost don't feel like you are playing ""games"". You are performing actions while being transported in another world. Think of real life games like Paintball or Escape Rooms. It's pretty similar. You know nothing can really happen to you and you are safe, but the immersion and fun are great. And it's very physical. Not to mention playing sports games like table tennis in VR, it's a real work out and pretty much a real deal. It's exciting.",Vive

"I know, I just meant for warehouse scale going wireless is important.",Vive
Just owning it asserts dominance over plebs.,Vive
"This.

Original Vive was great because it pushed roomscale, but next to any headset today it’s awful.",Vive
Yeah that CPU isn't going to cut it for wireless. The wireless adapter needs to compress the video signal on the fly which cripples even recent quad core CPUs,Vive
"Isn't that how all new things go?

The good thing is that for gamers, they only really need 5-10 titles right now to play around with, and there's more than that for index enabled games. You just need somewhere to start and build on that.",Vive
"It probably because this one is so close to release that they're talking about it. I'm willing to bet that the other two are benefitting from the tools they made for this one, but they're just not quite ready.",Vive
Yes please!,Vive
"I am having the same issue, did you ever find a solution?",Vive
Sounds splendid.,Vive
Please. PLEASE.,Vive
You have to sideload it iirc. Check out the OculusQuest sub for details and suggestions if problems pop up.,Vive
Sounds awesome,Vive
Good luck everyone!,Vive
I think it's ridiculous how they've made more VR headsets than games for the headsets. Imagine if Nintendo released a new console but didn't release any games for it until three years after launch. HL: Alyx and the two unannounced games should have been included with the original HTC Vive purchase.,Vive
"Some guy bought out a gta 5 vr mod a few months ago.
I've been a regular vr player for the last few years, and that mod made me feel sick as a dog to the extent that I needed to lay down for 45 mins. Motion sickness is horrible.",Vive
that's a nice treat for someone.,Vive
"Try it again but turn off 3D effect, it runs great and there's no stutter",Vive
"Congratulations, you won! PM incoming",Vive
"The Lab released with the Vive, stop being greedy",Vive
"shitty SDE, absolutely bottom-tier controllers, bad headband, crackly materials

the only upside is the lighthouse tracking, but several headsets use that nowadays so it's hardly a selling point- and with Rift S boasting zero external trackers it's just sorta meh nowadays for the average consumer body",Vive
Missus has just ordered me them for Christmas!,Vive
The Lab is a tech demo. It doesn't count.,Vive
Yeah that's the mod I'm talking about. I was able to play it fine with no noticeable stutter while playing on high settings even when recording. Complete opposite of the vorpx version.,Vive
Shit man for a game like this using Quest you’ll want a good backpack pc and just use link,Vive
"Do you just have a normal Vive? I think the only problem with your CPU is that its frequency is not that high, but with normal Vive I think it might be enough. There was some trick about putting the compositor (I think?) on high priority, which apparently helps some people. You can try searching about that. 

Other than that, yeah just try adjusting the transmitter location and reducing SS a little bit. Those may fix your problem. Also make sure no unnecessary programs are running when you're in VR.",Vive
I'm using a vive. I beat HL on my phone in flatscreen using Xash3D.,Vive
"Shit it only took me 30 minutes too get over motion sickness, I'd hate to be one of those people who has it worse. At some point, my brain just started to register that nothing in front of me was real.",Vive
"Holy fuck yes, gimme gimme gimme",Vive
Scrap Life 3 and Left 4 Meth confirmed.,Vive
Get Pimax 8KX.,Vive
"Hmm, it really depends... some games work pretty well with Virtual Desktop for full roomscale, while others are a stuttery mess. Skyrim VR for example works pretty well, even in roomscale. 

I‘m hoping for some serious technomagic from either Oculus or /u/ggodin to implement some kind of positional spacewarp on the quest to make roomscale movement more fluent. For stationary/seated experience, it already works pretty well.

One thing is clear for me, though: it‘s going to be very hard for me going back to a tether after experience the tether-free Lambda1VR port of Half Life 1 on the Quest...",Vive
What's cinematic VR mode?,Vive
"Says the entitled kid who thinks they know what a VR game is and isn't. Sorry 8 tech demos in 1 wasn't enough for you to ""count"" as a VR game.",Vive
"&gt; There are people who find it extremely hard to get motion sick anymore due to playing vr for a long time now

I'm definitely like that now, but I kind of regret it.  I was never ""Motion sick"", but when I first started using VR I could lose my balance if the ground under me suddenly shifted.  Back then VR was insanely immersive to me, it felt real.

But once I had a bunch of experiences where I had to resist that feeling of losing balance, and reaffirm to myself that I wasn't moving, the immersion was destroyed, I increasingly felt more and more like I had screens strapped to my face.

So yeah.. I think Valve has the right idea to not create experiences that cause people to become calloused to VR like that.",Vive
Since garry's mod started just as a mod for the base game I'd say that something will come out just a couple of days after the game is released.,Vive
"I have two memories of before I got my vr legs. The first was playing, I think it was drive club on psvr and crashing. I instantly took the headset off, layed down and passed out. The other I think of similar to what you was saying was playing windlands and feeling the pit in my stomach as I jumped off high places and hit the floor. 
I disagree about getting vr legs being a bad thing though. It allows you to do things you never could have before. And as time goes on and tech improves and changes, both software visually and hardware like headsets screens and haptics, you will get that feeling of Immersion again, you just won't feel sick.",Vive
"Just strap the pc to your back, the only thing needed is an extension cord and a buttload of ducktape.",Vive
Yeah same I only had a couple of times early on when I was using a psvr and playing really intense games that I felt sick at all. Having better tech and experience really helps. Plus I think just mentally accepting what is going on,Vive
"&gt;They really should have continued producing it and reduced the price.

$499 was probably the lowest they could go while turning a profit. These basestations and photodiodes are expensive.",Vive
"I think the main thing is that they were groundbreaking at the time, but nowadays there are often better games in their fields. Valve games often age quite well though, and because they broke new ground and it takes a while for other companies to catch up they often hold their ground for years and are still okay for ages after even that. But for modern players they aren't usually much different from current games.",Vive
They would either have to make a big part of the game multiplayer which would take away from the singleplayer elements too much or add a small multiplayer mode which would probably die quickly since there wouldn't be much focus on it. It's probably best that they focus on singleplayer for now.,Vive
"Theres no real shortage of affordable used gear on the market that you can pickup before contemplating the move to higher spec units. Certainly atm if I was buying it would probably be the quest thats the most compelling. With stand alone play, link play to pc and decent inside out tracking and better screens than the rift s... 

Cosmos could have been something special, if it had launched with decent tracking or at least support for og lighthouses built in and at about half the price it is now. Without the base stations it should be much cheaper to produce that the og vive but thats not reflected in the price currently.",Vive
They never said they were releasing the SDK. That would be a huge announcement because we've all been waiting for Source 2 for 6 years. But they didn't announce it.,Vive
"Same, I faced the same choice as OP and went with the Vive Pro just because of the wireless.  I'd already experienced wireless with my OG Vive and there really is no going back once you've tried it.  If Valve had offered a wireless option/adapter I'd have been all-in on the Index.  As it stands, I've got my wireless Vive Pro and I'll get some Knuckles for Christmas.",Vive
Sadly no. Was never able to work it out. I just use the advanced settings to turn my mic on and off when I don’t wanna be heard,Vive
The Lab is basically a 2-hour experience. It really is crazy to release a big technology and hope that other people make games that will get people to buy it. I'd be willing to bet that selling the Vive at a loss and profiting off of game sales like how consoles do it would have made VR much bigger today.,Vive
...experience?...,Vive
thankfully they did and the offer includes getting the controllers alone aswell,Vive
They already confirmed 2 other aaa Vr games a while back,Vive
"They could actually just sell the vive pro for a reasonable price. The vive pro has the same Oled resolution as the oculus quest, which is 399,- and is a stand alone headset that comes with better controllers and has all hardware for rendering games on board.

There is just no justification to sell it at the price they are doing",Vive
Maybe because it has some of the worst lenses and display on the market?,Vive

Agreed. VR is a whole new type of gaming that has completely revitalized my interest in gaming.,Vive
Add a 40mm USB fan,Vive
"Valve probably didn't expect that they had to to all the lifting for the VR progress. They more or less gave away all their technology for free, only for Oculus/Facebook to grab half of the team, only to care about mass adoption. Facebook could have easily fund a game of the scale of HL:A, but they never really cared about the software part, they want to build their own VR empire.",Vive
"Added a fan and while that did keep temps down, the gray screens and disconnects still persist.",Vive
"That's what I was suggesting. Lots of games have already done that forever, like space pirate trainer for instance. However, it wouldn't solve the issue that OP is talking about. OP is referring to essentially flipping the sword on the fly between protruding from your pinky area to your thumb area. That specific motion could be bound, but there is no way to bind every motion like it. And with any controller that isn't strapped to your hand, you could of course just do the action in real life to do it.",Vive
I just got a quest and I’d be happy to sell my Vive if anyone’s interested. I’ve barely used it and got it as a gift from former boss,Vive
"I’ve finished Portal in VorpX and it’s brilliant.  Save for a slight scale issue with with the Portal gun it feels like a native VR game.  Bioshock and Half Life 2 also feel like native VR.  

Check the list on [this page](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Glossary:VorpX) and look for games that support DirectVR.  Those are why you need vorpx.  The app has improved from feeling hacky to ‘holy crap how is this possible’.  Bioshock VR is one of the best gaming experiences I’ve had in my life.  

My recommendation is to set horizontal turning sensitivity high to mimic flick turning.  Helps a lot with motion sickness.  The only challenge with these conversions is having the stomach for 100% smooth movement.  Certain parts of games may test you.  Like crouch-walking in Bioshock has a head wobble which is uncomfortable so I minimize that.  And half life 2’s driving sections get me, so I’ve learned to switch to cinematic mode (3D virtual screen) for those parts.",Vive
"SDE, Controllers - agree.

Headband - with the DAS it's the best headband on the market. It's better than the Pro. 

Crackly - The Vive is a tank. I had mine bounce around in luggage on two dozen flights in the past 3 years (I'm a VR developer for enterprise, lots of business trips) and it still works like a champ.",Vive
"If you’re like me and skipped on the free upgrade, you should try the Media Creation Tool and see if you still have it. Not sure if it works now, but it worked for me about a couple of months back.",Vive
"How often, I get them from time to time, but not often.  People get grey screens on the Index too",Vive
"Enough to where it's annoying. Sometimes I won't see it, someone's I'll see it twice in fifteen minutes. 

I just want to not see it anymore.",Vive
VRNChill does help a bit,Vive
[removed],Vive
"Me too im from middle east (Bahrain) even tho i wanted the index but after some research not anymore because the index has LCD sceens with means washed out colors and not vibrant and less construct with white blacks and the vive pro has The AMOLED which is much better vibrant colors bright and colorful and deep blacks has alot of construct, also it has wireless which adds much immersion, even tho the valve index has alot of advantages over the pro with the (120/144hz, mic, and speaker) but i cant live without the vibrant bright colors with deep blacks and i think washed out colors of the LCD is an immersion breaker for me because im color sensitive thats why im going with vive pro even if the valve index ships in the future and has more advantages i just cant get over with bad colors",Vive

"What's you opinion now? One of the biggest problem of the Vive is the low resolution sometimes preventing to clearly see the sights of the gun, which is pretty disappointing in a shooter... Does the Index better resolution solves that?",Vive
"Right? It’s HLVR, that price is amazingly low.",Vive
"It will not completely go away even if you're wired,  just make sure your transmitter is up really high and base stations in are obstructed, when I'm sitting play Elite dangerous, the only time I go Grey's if I lean forward towards my desk and get out of the line of sight of the base station, other than that I can play for 5 or 6 hours straight. I actually think it has a lot to do with the base stations.",Vive

I never got a grey screens that forced me to restart steamvr when wired. That seems exclusive to wireless so far.,Vive
"I would fall flat on my ass, and GlaDOS better give me snark for it.",Vive
"I think you just need to adjust your equipment around a little bit and you shouldn't get them nearly as frequent, as for having to restart steam vr when you get a gray screen with the wireless adapter, that's just the nature of the beast.",Vive
"&gt; that's just the nature of the beast

That's pretty awful, but you might be right. Surely someone has a near perfect experience?",Vive
"I'm completely happy with mine, there's no way I can go back to the tether",Vive
"Surely Portal VR wouldn't be a game for anyone but those with strong VR legs. But I think it may work.

Before getting into VR if I had to guess one game that would be a terrible VR port the Serious Sam games may have come to mind. Ridiculously fast FPS with artificial locomotion seemed like a terrible idea. And look at the stunning work that Croteam did converting their games.",Vive
"I'm still happy but I get annoyed fairly easy. But yeah, that's one of the reasons why I switch between my Pro and my Index.",Vive
"I considered getting an Index, but I'm getting a 2080 ti instead,  I know the index is nice but I don't need two headsets.",Vive
"Looks intriguing, any idea on how much you guys are going to be releasing it for?",Vive
It will likely be $14.99 after launch discount,Vive
"Bought mine at launch, never got it to work decently round year, ambien temperature renders it completely useless for the hot months. Tried erryting, added a huge fan, modified the casing... Gave up, the tether is bliss ""VR"" lasts for more than 2-20min at the time. Immensly helps immersion when 50% of time isn't troubleshooting.",Vive
"Awesome, I'll be keeping an eye out!",Vive
Generally if you do the connector cable thing to lighthouses they tend to work better,Vive
I use 2.0 with anywhere from 3-4 stations. No cable options for these.,Vive
"The index is a fantastic headset, but the color muting people talk about vs the Vive is so real. The 120+ fps and the (sub)pixel density is really nice, convinced with the really nice speakers. 

Having the two as a pair is a really good option for best of both worlds comparisons. Some games do better with either headset. I'd also suggest waiting on a 2080ti as they're are rumors of the 30xx series coming out in like 6-7 months. I'd even skip over the rumored 2080tiS.",Vive
i like the vive wands       and the index controllers,Vive
"It's weird for me. Sometimes I'll never see it but other times I'll see it frequently, like all night. I bought mine at launch and have since bought another one, doesn't appear to be any different though.",Vive
yes they are worth it       i love them,Vive
Indeed. The OG Vive seems the best solution right now with not too high hardware recommendations anymore. Later on it has the perfect upgradability in which everway you want. Just saying.,Vive
"This looks amazing, can’t wait to purchase.",Vive
Thanks! It's a whole 'nother experience with a headset on,Vive
Well damn that's a change from launch then.,Vive
"If you happen to live in europe, they are still in stock at alternate.de

"&gt;A set of Source 2 tools for building new levels will be available for the game, enabling any player to build and contribute new environments for the community to enjoy. Hammer, Valve’s level authoring tool, has been updated with all of the game's virtual reality gameplay tools and components. 

From half-life.com. Obviously it might not include everything needed to make mods, but at the very least we'll have community made maps.",Vive
Its discontinued. I wouldnt buy one now.,Vive
Certified pre-owned available on their site.  https://www.vive.com/us/product/certified-pre-owned/vive/,Vive
"I added a fan to my Vive Pro's wireless adapter in my ITX build because its location in the Louqe Ghost build has the GPU shaust basically right on top and within minutes of operation I would start getting intermittent grey screens.  I hot glued a Noctua 40mm fan on top and set it to run at 50% pwm and haven't had a single hiccup since.

&amp;#x200B;

In my non ATX build, I didn't have a single problem with that wireless adapater in either chassis fwiw",Vive
"Alas, I'm us based. Thanks though",Vive
"search ""HTC VIVE Audio Strap "" on aliexpress and there are clones for 25 dollars.   Not seen much chat about them though.",Vive
"I was with you for the first half, but you lost me in the second half. Facebook obviously does understand the importance of good software. That's literally the reason for their walled garden first of all. And secondly they've released some of the highest quality games to date.",Vive
"It's still good that they releasing it, but people keep mentioning the SDK and we're not getting it. I wish we were, but we're not.",Vive
"It could be you didn't install the fan correctly. 

I was getting those gray screens on the vive pro wireless at least as often as you were. I tried using a fan and it did nothing. I tried it again months later and installed it differently to suck the air instead of blow it and also moved it closed to the vents. Since I did that, I have gotten one single gray screen in about 200 hours of gameplay.",Vive
That sucks... What should I get now then?,Vive
"I have the exact same build as you (same CPU and OC, Mobo and 2080ti!).  Also a Vive Pro and wireless.

I have the same issue as you.  I don't think it's temperature related.  I've never be able to improve the situation.

What I have noticed is that in seated games (like Elite Dangerous or Project Cars), I never get the disconnects after extended sessions.  It just seems to happen in standing games.

My two theories are:

 1) Moving around a lot increases data use and strain on the signal, which can cause it to drop out with the gray screen crashes.

 2) Since we have the same CPU and MOBO, perhaps there's a limit with USB bandwidth or PCI-E lane bandwidth that eventually causes a crash?",Vive
Are they really available in Canada? I looked for it this week and could not get them.,Vive
Means after your year subscription is over will be automatically charged full price if you don't cancel before then.,Vive
"It's an HTC Vive, not a Valve Vive. HTC did all of the pricing and content launch. Valve was just trying to get lighthouse tracking and more importantly Steam VR going so anyone could make games.

Oculus does sell at a huge loss, came out before the Vive, and is basically the console of VR?",Vive
"Yes, they just launched them in Canada this week.",Vive
I'm not sure those can ship to Canada,Vive
"quest, rift s or odyssey+",Vive
"The problem is it states after December 06, 2019, which is 2 weeks from now. That's where I'm not sure if they just didn't grab the proper price for that statement",Vive
"I was surprised to see it in my Steam and thought it was just them taking advantage of their position and marketing it to me.  I was pleasantly surprised when I realized and it was confirmed that I get a free copy for my ""knuckles"" purchase.",Vive
"It's difficult to argue about that right now, because HL:A hasn't published yet. But from what I expect, which could be totally wrong of course, it will be the killer app we waited for. But why didn't Facebook created it before? They already spent millions in funding VR games, but why hasn't THE game already arrived? That just makes me feel that Facebook cares way more about the hardware and mass adaption than actually innovate on the software side",Vive
"Okay, I'll have to check them out then. Thank you",Vive

"For many people there were many breakout ""the"" games. Lone Echo was spectacular. Robo recall is still the best arcade shooter in VR. The climb is pretty unique. Brass tactics is probably the best VR rts game. It's pretty unfair to ask why they haven't created a game like HL VR.",Vive

"Why is it unfair? 
Of course Half-Life is pretty hyped, but you can't deny that HL1 and HL2 were just amazing games. But why can't Facebook pull off something similar? It's not like they are magicians at Valve.",Vive
What are your favorite games?,Vive
Because they're not valve? You are aware valve has published some of the most popular games of all time and occulus have not. Have you played lone Echo?,Vive
"Oculus wasn't even existing when Valve released their last successful game, so there was plenty of time to develop an awesome VR game without standing in the shadow of Valve. Valve does still cook with water, it is not like they have an unfair advantage. My point was that I feel like FB/Oculus doesn't really try that to hard to develop appealing software for VR, that's all.",Vive
Garry's mod isn't by Valve it is by Garry Newman of Facepunch,Vive
"u/pharmacist10 has similar troubles to you, so it might be MOBO or PCI-E related.  My PC doesn't match your specs but the only time I've had grey screen was when I had external IR interference getting in the way of the wi-gig signal from the vive wireless antenna.  This problem was worse when using a wi-gig extension cable since the signal is so sensitive.  Otherwise it's smooth sailing without that interference.",Vive
I think the untextured models look really good in VR.   Textures just look like trash on my Vive.,Vive
You ignored my question so I'll ask again: did you play lone echo with touch controllers? Because if you didn't then I don't think you're qualified at all to comment on how good their best games are.,Vive

"I'm new to vr, I wonder if this feeling will set in over time",Vive
I agree... but especially in VR.,Vive
Thanks for all your work on this! Can't wait to play it!,Vive
"Compound works great with them. Natural gun holding and dropping, well mapped buttons... I highly recommend it.",Vive
Nice! Thanks!,Vive
Check out Valve Index too -  now shipping to Canada,Vive
Love the process of making it!,Vive
Now you're moving the goal posts to a totally different argument. You can't say Oculus hasn't released top level games when you haven't even played them.,Vive
Glad to help :),Vive
Will my  i5 6600k be able to run this?,Vive
I'd love to but I think it's a little out of my price range,Vive

"The difference between you and me ?

I make this shit look gooooood!  


Nice.",Vive
You realize the currently $250 right now Odyssey + is mid tier right?,Vive
Get in the locker NERD!,Vive
This looks like a great idea for pvp multiplayer,Vive
Are proper VR headsets even sold locally? Just get some disinfectant wipes or spray with a paper towel to dry it off,Vive
"It's certainly no HL:A in terms of style, visuals and story but I must admit for $30 it looks like it'll be a blast to play. Just excited to get a real physics driven game I can use my Index controllers with.",Vive
That’s the end goal!,Vive
"DAS should be included by default if they wanted to stay marketable, and they should have ditched the vive remotes ASAP- the SDE is playable, but you literally can't do anything properly if one of your controllers become damaged
The crackling is a product quality/reassurance thing moreso than an actual quality factor but it's really unsettling to have the headset pop like a kid's toy after what inevitably happens to the wands",Vive
What graphics card?,Vive
"I can hear my i5 4460 crying in the corner as well. Since its very physics dependant, will it be very CPU-heavy?",Vive
"There is no Oculus anymore, the original crew has all left, including Carmack.",Vive
1070,Vive
Yes in the steam store page sys requirements they mention CPU is very important for physics. Minimum is supposedly any quad core. But recommend is the i7 7700k...,Vive
"It really is I have everything I’ve ever wanted in  vr.  Galaxy gear lense mod.  Wireless adapter which is $50 off right now. 
Index comtrollers and body tracking.  In my opinion my headset shits on an index and it was like $200 less plus it’s freaking wireless which has virtually no latency i play beatsaber like crazy and rarely notice any latency in wireless.",Vive
"*sigh*, guess it might be time to finally upgrade my i7-3770k.  It's served me well!",Vive
"I brought up the Original Vive which only had a crappy head strap. They didn’t update the strap until later.

Quality wise the only issue I ever had was with lighthouse updates, but that’s a issue itself with design. Rift S is simple and simple sells.

I would never use a Vive as a PCVR over my Quest. The fact I can plug one wire into my PC and it just works can’t be beaten. Then clarity the Quest beats both the Vive and the Rift CV1, and tracking is great.

Sure if you put your hands behind your head for a length of time it can lose tracking, but that’s a small trade off considering i have almost never had a situation where it had any effect in VR.

Clarity wise it’s at a whole other level from the original Vive

Yeah I loved my Vive at the time. I choose it over the Rift which thought a Xbox controller was good enough at the time. The Vive just hasn’t aged well and the idea of them still selling it today is like Apple selling the first iPhone today. 

It’s done. Time to move on. If the cosmos fails that’s on them",Vive
As for call of duty zombies maps you need to set the gamemode to search and destroy,Vive
I just bought an index but if your ipd fits it i would say look at the quest with link cable. I wouldnt recommend rift s as when you demo it to friends it wont fit many of their ipds.,Vive
I imagine you'll be fine,Vive
I'm a 4770k. Someone tell me how to feel.,Vive
Have you tried that one soft body car simulator beam.ng?,Vive
him shoving that enemy in the locker was fucking amazing,Vive
Last minutes they mention the price.  $30 lower than I expected.   I can remember stress level zero somewhere talking about their general pricing strategy to start high and do sales events.  Seen in their other titles like duck season.  Half life might have tipped them down to the lower end but that is a different time frame.   I hope it isn't because the game isn't offering that much depth.,Vive
Excited to have a reason to upgrade?,Vive
"Tried finding somewhere to try them but no luck - so I just bought the Vive Pro, ordering the Index tonight, and I'll just return one after trying them both! :D",Vive
"&gt;I wouldnt recommend rift s as when you demo it to friends it wont fit many of their ipds.

Simple solution: Measure your IPD before buying. Rift S is a better PCVR experience than Quest and cheaper.",Vive
So excited for this. Might have to get the Vive wireless adapter and index controllers earlier than I expected...,Vive
My fans are installed properly on both of my Pros.,Vive
"Question for you all.

I bought an OG Vive back when it came out and was wondering what else if anything I need to be able to play Half-life:Alyx when it comes out. 

I figured I should buy those hand controllers since the game was built for it but do I need new room sensors or would the old ones work?",Vive
How are the index controllers treating you?,Vive
Wireless stuff too?,Vive
"The melancholy thing about Crunch Element to me is that it's such a good idea with such a good base already, you could be adding features and polishing this game forever before it's finished! But I've playtested and you have an incredible game here, will be buying day one and supporting you throughout!",Vive
"Farpoint was the game that proved to me that smooth locomotion wasn’t an issue, and I know it took work by the developers.  As far as I know that’s at the standard for smooth locomotion that other people have followed, with appropriate directional drift associated with where you were looking.  I can feel that sort of thing in vorpx and it makes a huge difference.  But yeah Skyrim and FO4 are perfect.  And getting used to those games is a gateway drug to other faster smooth locomotion games.  I tried the original half-life 2 VR mode and it made me sick, but vorpx i have barely any issue.  

Yeah I don’t know much about the 1060 but I have the amazing headroom of a 2080ti and it helps a ton... I’m even pushing the games like Bioshock up to 2160p.  Are you running in 4x3 resolutions on vorpx?  Cause that’s good for the headset and I think puts the pixels to better use allowing you to crank the resolution higher than expected",Vive
"If it's any consolation, levels of immersion are effectively random for me.",Vive
"Looks really good, and it's cheaper than I expected. The physics look fantastic. The last trailer actually lowered my expectations but this raised them a lot. It looks so good.",Vive
Try putting the WiGig card in all of your different PCI-E slots and playing for a while with the card in each slot. Even the long ones that look too big work as well. Check out your motherboard manual to find out all the slots if you're not technically inclined although they usually are marked PCI-E on the motherboard.,Vive
That part was pretty good. Didn't think he'd actually fit that guy into the locker!,Vive
"Hold on...wait, what....oh",Vive
"no, not yet.",Vive
"I've barely used them. The finger tracking is pretty flakey but once you get going you don't notice. My main issue with them is the severe lack of games that really utilise them. Most of the games that support it still feel very vive wandy - as in, you just press a trigger or grip with a certain interaction point and it snaps to your hand. H3VR for example, I'd rather use the Vive wands!

HL:A, Boneworks and Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners are the first batch of games I really want to try with them - where you just grab/push things/weapons/enemies around.",Vive
"What's your argument? I never played Oculus games because I have a Index and because the games never appealed to me. I don't doubt that Lone Echo is a great game, but I doubt it is comparable to HL:A. And the main argument against VR is to this day that there is not enough appealing content. Are you saying that Lone Echo is as good as HL:A will be and everybody who complains about the lack of content just didn't try Lone Echo? Or what do you want to say? And how is their walled garden a sign that they think good software is important? Imo that's a sign that they want a monopoly in VR and force everybody in their eco system.",Vive
"I think HTC will go out of business very soon, which will be a real shame. The Cosmos is an embarrassment and they refuse to drop the price of the Vive Pro, which is a great headset.",Vive
The OG Vive doesn't have as many problems as the wireless pro.,Vive
hla wont be as good as this game in any way.,Vive
What makes you say that? HL:A looks to have the exact same kind of mechanics.,Vive
Yep! The 4x3 resolutions actually make older CRT-era games work better than ever!,Vive
"I'm actually watching it right now, and funny enough it's why I'm here. You made me start looking into a vive.",Vive
"Interesting about the OG, I hadn't heard that. However, I have also set up a few newish i7 computers with 1070s and Vive Pros using HTC wireless with a fan setup and they perform great. Have you tried the card in different PCI-E slots though? Some of Vives official generic troubleshooting steps do include testing the card in different slots too although not explicitly for the grey screens but it's what worked for me. Best of luck!

 Turns out you might get [free half-life](https://www.roadtovr.com/half-life-alyx-vr-headset-support-free-for-index-owners/)  out of it,Vive
I do!,Vive
"Yeah just spitballing some ideas, I really don't know what else to consider.",Vive
I think it requires some setup to get vr working but I’ve played it flat screen with a wheel and it feels great. Lots of maps and cars,Vive
I never said it was from Valve. I just think that another mod will pop out eventually for VR using HL:A as a base.,Vive
Good god dude you're all over the place. Your whining that Facebook hasn't released anything as good as HLVR will be. My point is youve played neither so who gives a shit what you think. Does that make it clear enough for you shit for brains? Jesus I'm so sick of all your bad faith arguments.,Vive

"I’m also curious to know why you think that, considering Valve’s strong history of good games.",Vive
Just looked at the Steam page and was getting a strong deja vu feel about this. I was wondering if I'd maybe seen this in VR in Destinations.... then I came back and read the whole post and realised that it was something that I must have downloaded on Reddit and checked out way back when!!!,Vive
"Breachers vs defenders would be cool, but so would two breaching teams competing for the same objective.",Vive
"I think ive been waiting for a fresh coat of polish since the first gameplay dropped and then when i realized they wernt going to polish anything but instead just make more levels was a bit disapointing...


The most recent trailer is just repeated textures on the walls with no lighting/shadows and just a lot of junk objects laying around.  Its like they are just gunning for the finish line before hla",Vive
Agree completely.  I felt lost in the world of City 17 back when HL2 came out and that was just flat screen....this is going to be unbelievable from Day 1 and extended indefinitely by all the community creations and mods thanks to the tools the game will ship with.,Vive
Oh cool! Very interested in your comparison and which one you go with. Keep us posted?,Vive
"Assuming you enjoyed every minute of it, you did it right...",Vive
"That was my impression too, but they were pretty guarded about a lot of things the whole time so I wouldn't be surprised if they're just keeping it under wraps for now....just like they did with this release, amazingly.",Vive
"The condition will obviously vary but I bought mine second hand over a year ago and have had no problems. This kit was someone's hard earned savings they will have treated it gently. I've accidently bashed a wall a fair few times and it's still in great condition.

If it does not come with the delux audio strap you must purchase that also, it's pretty much unplayable for more than 15min without it. They are around $100 new.

I would cost in buying foam replacements for around $20 for a pack of 3 good ones. The foam is the only thing really that could be worn down. It starts to pinch if they are.

So yeah in summary I totally recommend getting a second hand Vive, even over a new Rift S.",Vive

"No, back in 2017, [Gabe Newell stated that they were working on 3 VR games](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/291222):

&gt; So one of the questions you might ask us is 'Why in the world are we making hardware?' **So right now, we're building 3 VR games**. And what we can do now is to be designing hardware at the same time that we're designing software. This is something that Miyamoto has always had, right?",Vive
Price is steep but very worth,Vive
Are there any free games that have this mode? I don't suffer from motion sickness but I'd be curious to try it anyway.,Vive

Which website?",Vive
"&gt; They are around $100 new

The delux audio strap was discontinued along with the OG Vive a few weeks ago, and are now out of stock everywhere. Used ones are going for $160-200 on ebay because people are buying them to put on the Quest.",Vive
"Shadows are completely dropped now? Looks a bit like a quest game.

Could still be very cool.",Vive
"I am a bit bothered by the fact, that there is not a single shadow rendered obviously.",Vive
The official VIVE website,Vive
The lack of ANY shadows bothers me too.,Vive
Isn’t the VIVE supposed to come with headphones or are those not very good?,Vive
"Don't buy an official refurbished Vive, they are selling for more than a new Rift S which is just *stupid*. I love my Vive, I've had 6 or 7 of them over the past 3 years (I'm a developer) but it's done. The Rift S is just better.",Vive
What’s so good about the Rift S,Vive
"The display is much better, the headset is smaller and lighter. Don't forget that the original Vive hardware is almost 5 years old at this point.",Vive
What about controller feedback and does it come with built in headphones?,Vive

"For the people buying it, it is. Not recommending at headset in general just because it *might* not fit your head doesn't make sense if it's otherwise the best choice.",Vive
"Its kind of baffling to be honest, their past games have had really great art styles, polish,  graphical options, lighting etc.. professional stuff. And this is just really janky and basic. 

I have a subtle feeling that theres either a CRAZY amount of depth and the levels are just crazy different and beautiful, or its all an okay looking physics demo like you said with genius marketing",Vive

"I had the same issue. I have found that it’s more up to the quality of the actual game to create immersion for me now. Not that it’s a perfect game, but I thought I was beyond feeling immersed before the end boss of Budget Cuts grabbed at me through a wall. Then holy shit did I forget I was in my VR room completely. Other moments have gotten me too. Role playing helps as well.",Vive

Do you have a lot of reflective surfaces?,Vive
"OG Vive will work just fine with nothing else required. The index controllers are not required but the game was designed with them in mind so likely this game would showcase the controllers off very well. I'm thinking about buying them myself, but they are certainly not required.

FYI, most games don't have great support for the finger tracking on the index controllers at the moment so it's pretty limited at the moment.",Vive
"I had to finally upgrade from my i7-3770k earlier this year. Even with a 1080ti, Destiny 2 kept getting CPU-bound frame hitches, and my Vive would fail to keep up with 90fps which lead to motion sickness.",Vive
What I want to know is can I be Revolver Ocelot? I HAVE to know if gunspinning is in this game.,Vive
"There's been something bothering me about this game since I first saw it, and could never pinpoint it. I just now realized that it's the lack of shadows. It just looks so weird.",Vive
"The only reflective surface I have is the floor, but I haven’t experienced issues with that since I got the Vive.",Vive
How reflective is it?  Reflections from a china cabinet caused my own stuttering issues that were fixed by covering it.,Vive
"You’d barely notice it, unless there’s a significant amount of light shining onto it.
Plus, the Vive’ll run smoothly for about a minute or so, and then it’ll start lagging like crazy.",Vive
Definitely a stylistic choice by Brandon or someone there,Vive
"You can try Vive tech support.  

 [https://www.vive.com/us/support/contactus/](https://www.vive.com/us/support/contactus/)",Vive
That could be interesting!,Vive
Get them in 2019 and the $70 game is free AND you'll get some bonus VR environments etc in the New Year.,Vive
That's what you need the delux audio strap for. Headphones in the audio strap are really decent,Vive
"Heh heh....obviously someone that didn't follow Blqck Mesa's development. Firstly, Black Mesa took forever, no fault of the developer but stilll it took 10 years to come out as is since announced....obviously you're not a fan.......Second....Beta testing is not A) final and B) still not final...I din't come down on the matter either way. Sounds like someone has their hopes up, and it sure isn't me. If it comes out then ""woohoo""....if it doesn't then ""who cares""....except you.",Vive
"Sorry misunderstood your question, the headphones on the audios trap are an upgrade and a must on their own but it's not just that. The original Vive came with a real poor headstrap, essentially it was a stretchy thong that kept the thing strapped to your face. As a result the headset ways down on the front of your face and you get a real pinch of the band on the back of your skull. The delux audio strap completely changes the headset making it a solid strap that distributes weight evenly and leads to a lot more comfort.",Vive
Did they really say it's only free if purchased in 2019?,Vive
Yeah I noticed this just a few minutes ago when I went to request to return my unopened controllers because I thought since I just got them 3 weeks ago i wouldn’t get the game. . . But I got the game even from an older purchase. So no need to return and buy again. So valve actually was classy and saved themselves money on returns as well!,Vive
"Oh man down. Here in the UK most suppliers have them in stock still though for £100, figured the states would be the same if not better.

 I would hope second hand Vives are coming with the strap as it's pretty much a must have. I saw htc were selling all new Vives with the strap by default which is good. Shame for those without them, a third party really needs to step up and start making accessories like straps.",Vive
The DAS is truly HTC's best product ever. It's also amazing on the Quest.,Vive
Are you drunk?,Vive
"I'm trying to decide if they are worth it for me. I have a rifle stock for the vive wands and don't want to have to get another stock for the index controllers.

I'm also debating on just getting the Index + controllers, but I have a feeling I'll have to make some upgrades on my system. Also I barely play VR these days so...",Vive
...no you didn't.,Vive
Everyone already knew this. Why are  you talking about it?,Vive
"I'm currently developing an educational chemistry VR lab in my university, and watching the wine bottle breaking with the splash on the floor gave me a insight I have not thought before for this kind of phisical interaction with liquids! I was looking for a easy way to make flasks with chemicals break on the floor, and your mechanic in the trailer is just really clever and ideal for that, loved it! =D

Besides that, awesome graphics and beautiful architecture; definitly something that is worth to be preserved with VR!",Vive
For indoor gaming,Vive
"No, there are no free games that offer it. It's a feature of Vorp-X which I believe costs $40 dollars.

There is no free trial. I think it is pretty great software for what it is. Apparently it's come a long way from where it was a few years ago.

Vorp-X Lets you play any game in VR (some are better supported than others). Some games are ""natively"" supported by VorpX and it really breathes life into old ""pancake"" games.

https://www.vorpx.com/supported-games/",Vive
Very doubtful and not because of their VR.  The Vive Pro is still the standard for business and their market is prosumer and professional applications.,Vive
"Ah, didn't realise it was a Vorp-X only feature. The lack of a trial really puts me off Vorp-X though which is why I don't have it.",Vive

"I'm a web developer, but have taught Unity. I've been playing around with web applications as VR experiences. It's incredibly interesting.",Vive
"I know there have been a few audio issues raised with Steam VR and the VIVE in the past, but none have quite dealt with the issue I've been experiencing lately.

Basically I'm using an original Vive and just recently I've been getting horribly distorted audio through both the Vive headset and any other audio device I try while VR is running.

The weird thing is, the audio actually starts off fine, but after a minute or two, it becomes horribly distorted to the point it's pretty much unbearable to listen to. I've unplugged and replugged in the setup, uninstalled and reinstalled Steam VR, etc. and the problem is still present.

Does anyone have any ideas? It's driving me to distraction. Thanks in advance :)",Vive
No. It is an occulus exclusive. You can play using revive however,Vive
"Yeah, I was skeptical but i went for it and I am very happy. A trial would have been nice and the lack of it really puts people off.

Also, really dumb that it's not offered on Steam. If it were on Steam, he could probably sell it for 40-50 dollars and make a killing. Not sure the reasoning there.",Vive
"Anker 20000 nah lasts 6+ hours, I've got 2 and never use the HTC battery.",Vive
is mah the same as nah? Can only find mah,Vive
Typo...yes mah,Vive
The original vive wands are $130 each or $260 a pair...so it's not a bad price.  Unlike the wands though there is a definite left and right controller here so they can't just sell you one at a time.  In fact if one of my controllers breaks I don't know how I'm gonna replace just the broken one and I might have to buy a whole new pair.,Vive
"My suggestions: 

CPU: [Ryzen 3600](https://www.newegg.com/amd-ryzen-5-3600/p/N82E16819113569?Description=ryzen%203600&amp;cm_re=ryzen_3600-_-19-113-569-_-Product) \- In my opinion the 3600 is worth a little bit more money. However, if you absolutely can't swing it, then go with the 2600 instead of the 2600X. The 2600 should be on sale for around $115 or so. 

Board: [MSI Tomahawk Max](https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16813144267) \- Don't have firsthand experience with this board, but it seems to be well respected. 

Memory: Two options:  [Crucial Ballistix Sport LT](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MGPK7XC) \- Can be overclocked fairly easily to 3600 CL16. However, an alternative would be to grab [Team Dark Pro 3200 CL14](https://www.newegg.com/team-16gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820313712?Description=team%20dark%20pro&amp;cm_re=team_dark_pro-_-20-313-712-_-Product). It will also do at least 3600 CL16 but it will be a little bit faster than the Ballistix due to tighter subtimings, but most importantly overclocking it will be more straightforward since you can take the values straight from [Ryzen DRAM Calculator](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/ryzen-dram-calculator/).  

For only $30 more I'd go for the Team Dark Pro personally, especially if you don't have much experience with memory overclocking. It will be less of a hassle to get working at good settings, and memory speed makes a substantial difference in Ryzen performance. However with the 3600 that puts the budget at more like $420 at current prices (maybe the CPU will be cheaper on Black Friday?). If you drop down to the 2600 that puts you back under budget, but you're giving up probably 20% performance. 

Wireless adapter works fine on Ryzen now.",Vive
"oh, one more thing I forgot to mention. Reflective objects and sunlight mess with the lighthouses, so make sure that there's nothing reflective that the lighthouses can see and that they don't get any direct sunlight",Vive
Single stick of memory offers terrible performance. Don't even consider that.,Vive
"Yes, the release of this game with be year zero. We will have BA (before Alyx) and AA (After Alyx)",Vive
Why the fuck not valve?,Vive
I hope Valve will eventually also release Half Life VR games for VR systems like The Void that gives players a backpack with the computer in and let's them run around unlimited by redirecting their walkling (you walk straight in game but in real life you are actually walking in a circle),Vive
"Team Fortress VR, the original team fortress also started as a mod.",Vive
If you want to see just how badass Barney is though play Blue-Shift.,Vive
i didn't buy it yet but its already in my steam library?,Vive
"So I'm thinking about getting this from the Rift.    
How good is index **actually?**  What's the screen resolution + FOV and is there still some screen door effect?",Vive
"I remember *years* ago, after the Gen 1 Vive was announced but well before it's release, the speculation that a new Half Life was coming but it'd be a VR game and we'd see it with Vive. And I was like ""Huh, nice thought, I'm cautiously optimistic but a bit skeptical.""

When it just didn't happen a while into Vive being out it became ""No dude they're gonna do it still but Vive is just Gen 1 they wanna iron out the kinks and have a more polished offering before the game comes out"" and at that point my reaction was ""Give it up dude. It was a nice thought but it obviously isn't happening.""

I guess I have a *lot* of crow to eat, and it couldn't be tastier.",Vive
"This is incredibly smart marketing. I was holding off on Index, it seemed like a meaningful step up from Vive but I was waiting for the content to really make it a must-have VR upgrade. Here it is. I listed my Vive for sale as soon as I saw the announcement.",Vive
The TPCast wireless adapter sucks and is extremely unreliable,Vive
"VR since like a month after vive release. I personally can't stomach 2d games anymore. 

Would rather do something else instead.",Vive
Ah crap.  Thanks for warning me at least,Vive
Sorry :X,Vive

They're 200 if you discount the price of the free game you'll be getting.,Vive
250 if you discount the free game.,Vive
so happy I bought the valve index controllers at launch now,Vive
TF3?,Vive
yea but then you save $60 on the game,Vive
What does that mean? Don't fucking tell me the controllers alone are 300.,Vive
"oh,",Vive
It looks like a wave shooter with minimal or forced movement in the trailer.,Vive
Woah I had mine day one! Sooooo......no one cares guys.....,Vive
Please google search your dumb fucking questions.....this has been known since development started.,Vive
No. You have to have google cardboard....it’ll sense corrugation so don’t try to deceive it.,Vive
.....dumbass,Vive
......who’s never played HL? Get the fuck outta here kid.....,Vive
You can go read your Berenstain Bears books child. You ain’t ready.,Vive
Uhhh it took nearly a decade for Black Mesa to be released *without* Xen....so calm down dipshit.,Vive
Yes it will,Vive
"You can buy the controllers only, without the index headset. They will work with the standard VIVE.
That's probably what I'm going to do as my standard controllers are dying and there's no way I'm giving HTC AU$450 for two controllers. Especially when they keep failing.",Vive
If this doesn't work out your best bet is to look for someone selling it on OfferUp or LetGo and contacting them about renting,Vive
"ViveOG  2016, VivePro 2017 Vive Cosmos 2019

Vive OG and Pro use ""cameras"" made by Valve same  as Valve Index  and similar to Oculus Rift OG (2016) to track HMD and controllers

Vive COsmos has built in cameras like Windows Mixed Reality and Rift S, BUT tracking isn't as good as all VIves WMR and Rift S, HTC will release a faceplate for Vive Cosmos to use Vives ""cameras"" to use that flawless tracking :

Giant fan is a necessity.,Vive
"Great news, thanks mate. 
 
I got my vive like 2 weeks before we found out we were having our first kid. My VR journey had to take a bit of a back seat haha.  
 
There's nothing wrong with my OG vive at all so it's a good thing I cN just grab the controllers because there is no chance I would be buying a whole new set up right now.",Vive
Yeah cool thanks man. Didn't have a computer without dial up growing up and only played discount console games. By the time I built a decent PC HL was over a decade old and I had other focuses. Sorry for trying to experience on what I missed out on. ( ° ͜ʖ͡°)╭∩╮,Vive
"The controllers alone are €300 (or possibly €280, or maybe that was the lighthouses),",Vive
"Atm, The Witcher 3 and Smash bros. I prefer to sit down and play sometimes. Not being fully immersed and being able to pause and do something else is what I want at times.",Vive
"Congratulations on the impending family. I'm a bachelor, no children, 57 years old.  I can play computer games till 3:00AM and often do without having to worry about any adult responsibilities. I can't really say if that's a good thing or not. It is what it is.
At least you'll have children to care about you when you're too old to hold a controller. I suspect they'll find me in VR 4 months after I died. Man, this conversation went dark fast.",Vive
"Yes, I am annoyed by it.  Not going to lose any sleep over it though.",Vive
"thanks, i tought it was the same thing",Vive
"thanks, i tought it was the same thing",Vive
"They do work well, but how many of those games have physics interactions on the arms? I like having arms, but I also notice many times that they don't correspond to my real arms. That's fine when it's just a graphical thing, but if it's going to be interacting with the environment I'd rather they not be there.",Vive
"I just hope they will also release some non-VR Source 2 game. I love VR and will surely play Half-Life: Alyx, but I really wish for some universal moddable src2 game to build upon.",Vive
"Idk people were complaining about how it'll never get finished [in 2012](https://www.giantbomb.com/half-life/3025-293/forums/half-life-1-still-worth-getting-into-554007/), I'll believe it when I see it.",Vive
It's a lot of work for very little effect. It's almost a gimmick.,Vive
"I would rather no arms than janky inverse kinematics, which takes a lot of work to get right.",Vive
Headset numbers are growing. Eventually SteamVR games will work on most of those headsets. As the number of headsets grow Oculus tactics are going to need to change.,Vive
It took me probably a good 25-30 hours to get thru HLVR on DK1.,Vive
And that won't matter because at the end of the day selling games is their focus. What they are providing is the one platform that offers games that can run on any VR hardware and that will become a more powerful thing each time a new headset is released whereas Oculus tactics will become weaker. Eventually I believe they're going to have to change tactics as the amount of hardware on the market becomes overwhelming.,Vive
Could be wrong but I'm guessing the main reason is they won't want a wave of youtube videos with people fondling themselves as Alyx. I'm sure they could have pulled off some amazing IK but I'm not sure they want their first flagship game to be even a hint of controversial.,Vive
"While it's not essential, I'd recommend playing Blue Shift, as it establishes the backstory of a character in Half-Life 2. It's also quite short (around 3-4 hours), so you can finish it in an afternoon. Opposing Force is fun, but it doesn't really relate to Half-Life 2 so you can safely skip it.",Vive
"I don't believe any VR service works over the cloud currently? All headsets currently (except quest) require they be connected to a very powerful PC in close proximity. The quest computes everything on the headset at a reduced fidelity and thus requires no cables.

Also I think your numbers are wrong. The TPCast supposedly introduces a latency of sub 2ms while the HTC wireless adapter apparently introduces a sub 7ms latency and wired latency is less than both of these. Depending on what frequency you want the whole VR experience to be running at you're gonna need the overall round trip to be sub 11ms for 90 fps, 16ms for 60fps (or 60ms if you want to run at 15 fps and throw up).

This round trip includes:
- sensors detecting and computing controller + headset POSEs
- sending this data to your PC
- processing this and rendering the game
- sending the response image to the headset

While 5g is impressive I almost guarentee advertised sub 10ms latencies have been calculated between an optimally located device and a 5g tower. There are however many factors that will push you further and further away from any advertised latency (e.g. network routing, signal strength, network load, distance to travel etc). At the end of the day 5g is just a fast way to connect your phone to a wired network because wired networks are still much  faster than 5g. So if we can't achieve cloud computed VR with a completely wired solution then there is no hope for a completely wireless one.",Vive
"nah, i rather have no arms, than janky IK predicted ones which are never in the place where my real ones are. even valve said once they rather have no arms in place since they found that hands alone brought a better presence result than hands with arms flopping around with a IK model. thats the reason why you find NO valve made vr content with arms.",Vive
Time to buy VR,Vive
TFA,Vive
This comment aged terribly.,Vive
Nice. I'll probably pick up some controllers close to the game's release,Vive
"Oh, so I wouldn't have to strap on the controllers just to notice my hands are reversed? Actually cool.",Vive
They are some of the best vr controllers anyway,Vive
"I prefer floating hand, wish I had them irl",Vive
I used to play with this editor quite a bit. Just stupid things like making a button which spawned enemies and having a button near me that spawned health or ammo. Just mucking around. Cant wait to be able to fire up and jump in to a VR version of that sandbox.,Vive
I play a lot of Factorio. Theres no way that would translat eot VR. Even 3d versions like Satisfactory dont work well. I just enjoy logistics puzzles.,Vive
"Actually, don't sell Oculus short. Of all the entrants in this race they're the ones bringing quality VR at a good price. I'm about to buy a rift-s shortly to upgrade from my Vive. I can't quite bring myself to spend the AU$2000 it would cost me to get the Index even though I would like to, but AU$650 for the Rift-S is a good step up. And oculus have a good store of games building up. They're not going to disappear from the scene and I suspect they even have some surprises in the works.",Vive

HL2 put story line into fps genre which was originated by Doom/wolfenstein. This was a revolution on its own.,Vive
"VR shouldn't be monopolised by Facebook and their practice of restricting software to their hardware only. Valves approach of allowing any headset to run any software is much healthier for VR in the long run. I realise as a casual user you probably don't care about that and that's great for Facebook, but it isn't great for VR.",Vive
"&gt; Index controller

You've got it basically right: The Index VR kit includes controllers.

You're not quite right though: They come in pairs, rather than as a single controller.",Vive
"Yeah, the curved portion that goes around the knuckles is on the opposite side for the opposite hand.   It really isn't possible to get them swapped around.",Vive
"Decades, no shit",Vive

Japan is working on one which will suck your dick too.

But I'm not going to wait forever, as if you never purchased anything until it was perfect, you'd never buy anything at all.",Vive
"Add to that the Mod support, and this will also be an evergreen title and just like Half life 1 and 2 live, be active and relevant forever. Wouldn't be surprised if I sink in more hours into than in longer titles like Asgards Wrath",Vive
This is r/videos. Not r/philosophy.,Vive
"I guess you can compare like this.  


1. Resolution/Picture Quality : Cosmos Wins as it have a higher resolution and Screen Door Effect.
2. Cost : Vive is much cheaper but no longer produced.
3. Tracking : Vive is much better than Cosmos as it is using the light house system. You can play in pure darkness using HTC Vive.
4. Ease to setup: Cosmos is easier as no need to setup lighthouses,
5. Comfort: Subjective.
6. Upgrade Path: Vive wins as let's say u have the $$$ and u can just use the Vive Pro / Index with the controller/lighthouse which come to your original Vive. 

I can only recommend the Cosmos if you doing sim racing/flight games where tracking is not as important and u need the high resolution screen to see further/read text better.",Vive
"I don't like it either but at least we have the hands now, it used to be floating guns.",Vive
Maybe it's because i am running Oculus game?,Vive

Vive Cosmos is an overpriced disaster of a launch, it might get better or it might not, in any case definitely would not buy.

Vive Pro is the only product in the Vive family that can be recommended but only if you want wireless. Very expensive.

You probably should consider other headsets.",Vive
I dont think you've understood my comment nor do I think you have a clear understanding of what's involved on a technical level or what headsets are currently doing and are capable of. But I like your energy and optimism.,Vive

"No, it's Half.",Vive

theyve been developing this with the modern VR technology for like 4 years so yea i think they tried it, it turned out to not fit their vision of the game, and scrapped it",Vive
"Cant find it on finn, will they ever start shipping to Norway?

never heard of Dane, but will cheak it out..",Vive
"Having spent quite a lot of time working to un-distort these lenses I can see why we see Fresnel lenses are being used. The main advantage being they are much more forgiving with location and how you wear the headset and the shape of your face, position of your eyes etc. and have more consistent distortion across them. 

Of course the down side is small sweetspot, lack of clarity, and light refraction from the Fresnel grooves.  But if your making a mainstream headset then these tradeoffs are better for the majority vs customers spewing up because of distortion effects.

While these lenses like the Gear VR lens are much clearer, getting the exact headset placement, to within a couple of mm is fairly critical to get a pleasant result. It also seems nigh impossible to get rid of both barrel distortion and pupillary swim  across the entire lens. 

Barrel distortion is to keep straight lines straight, and not curved, and also to not curve as you move change angle and the straight line moves through the entirety of the lens.  While pupillary swim is areas of the image stretching or compressing in places where its not supposed to. Overall it seems a better experience to eliminate the swim more so than the distortion. As long as the bits of image seem to end up where your brain expects them do and not float about then it seems ok with sometimes things being a bit curved.

If placement is off or you are sensitive to one more than the other then the result may indeed seem off, your brain will also be working much harder to reassemble the images its being fed and you will quickly get eye fatigue or experience nausea.

Of course I seem to have run into the limit of what my brain, eyes and face can do, and I am being highly critical. At this point in game no troubling effects are noticeable unless I really go out of my way to look for them. I wouldn't say its 100% (maybe its 98% there) yet and someone with better understanding of the calibration system may be able to do a better job of yet.",Vive
You are entirely wrong. Oculus works with SteamVR and many vr games on steam have native support as well.,Vive
"Meant a Finish person, Danish person, Swedish person. there's been no indication from valve that Norway, Iceland, Switzerland or Lichtenstein will get the Index anytime soon.",Vive

I noticed they pack in the game with the hardware which is great because as a full price game that is a decent chunk of savings.,Vive
You are correct! I read the page wrong! Excellent!,Vive
"Technically the Index controllers are compatible with any SteamVR game. Some programmers either don't use Steam Input API or just don't update which is where gameplay issues come from.

I love my Index controllers and I haven't gone back to my Vive wands since I got them.

Only downside is some known hardware defects which Valve will repair/replace but it takes time.",Vive
"Its not really a fair comparison. I use wireless headphones for more than an hour every day, a good pair is a higher priority.",Vive
"I haven't tried that in a while.  I'll have to try that again and let you know how great it works. I think it was harder than in real life, so I wondered if I needed to improve the physics settings.  Just shooting a ball is a little easier.
It would be pretty fun if it does work well.",Vive
"That sounds good.  The AI teammates might not be super smart at first, but at least that would be a little like real life pickup games :)",Vive
"Well your first issue is that Vive is HTC and the Index is Valve. Valve Index controllers are available exclusively on the Steam Store https://store.steampowered.com/app/1059550/Valve_Index_Controllers/

You can get them second-hand from sites like ebay but you can't get them new anywhere else.",Vive
"That is a great game suggestion - Freekicks and penalty challenges should be the most reasonable thing to make.  I haven't posted much, but I can start posting more. Reddit or the same ID on Twitter is good: @EricODev",Vive
This! I had the same problem. Soccer with a VR headset can break things. It helps to wear shoes and not kick near the edge of the playspace.,Vive
Valve has said that you might miss out on some of the interactions in the game without the knuckles. But for the most part it will be pretty similiar with any other controller.,Vive
"I don't understand how people can enjoy War Dust, but to each their own eh?",Vive
"if you'd tell me how can I buy them from steam, as a business. You know, because tax",Vive
"But they are completely different though. 

It would be like watching a movie for the first time and deciding to never read a book again. Seems silly.",Vive
"That might be a better question for Steam support. I know it's hella easy for anyone in one of the countries they ship to to buy as an individual.

If your company offers it, you could buy as an individual and be reimbursed for it. That's one purchase method the company I work for offers as long as it is still a company approved purchase.",Vive
"Yessss will start following you, thanks!!!! Can’t wait to see where this goes",Vive
"But probably not much, right? I'm kinda sceptical of custom songs becoming a big thing in this game just because making them would be so complex.",Vive
How much are just the controllers?,Vive
Oh that sounds like a number one Steam Workshop mod already.,Vive
Oculus does that shit,Vive
you must be fun at parties,Vive
where can you order them?!?!?! i searched all over the website and the internet last night and couldnt find anything,Vive
"TBH, I've slowly grown to kinda hate them more and more over time.  I have now had the problem with the thumb stick developing a 1/3rd dead-zone for a *second* time, so I have to jump through the RMA hoops again.  Thats on top of the fact that they are so awkwardly shaped that the bottom of my hand/palm is getting squeezed so much i develop a callous while the top of my hand is floating free so it wiggles around and really messes with your aim/coordination.

To me they are a nearly perfect embodiment of second system syndrome.",Vive
"Index controllers are better weight balanced than vive wands and much more comfortable.

Finger tracking support is kinda fun and you can show rude gestures in online games while other people cant :)

Knuckles strap allow to let go of the controller and you can grab things almost like in real life. Throwing things is also fun and feels natural. This really benefits to overall immersion.

I've sold my Vive Pro controllers after I got Index Knuckles and I regret nothing, but you better try them somewhere (if possible) before you buy.

And looks like Index controllers are bit fragile in comparison to Vive Wands. Also you can't replace single one Index controller yet, as they sold in pairs. There was some thubmstick issues, but looks like Valve fixed it in new batches.",Vive
"The controllers are cool and all, but the headset upgrade from Vive to Index made a much bigger difference to me.  The controllers are better, but didn't change as much as I imagined in my head- Biggest improvement is the vastly improved grip sensor. 

They are great.  $300? Depends.  I'd advise trying to hit 500 to upgrade HMD first personally.",Vive
But you bought it used and likely years after he did so....,Vive
Considering we are playing Alyx... if they put her skinny arms I think it would be more immersion breaking for me than not having it. Would be nice to have it as an option so I could try it and see. It might well be an option.,Vive

TLDR: I hope that in the future games won't just copy from HL:A",Vive
They are a fantastic piece of tech. The only downside I find is that with sword games because they are strapped to your hands you cannot angle the sword in your hand. Otherwise if the game supports it they are awesome.,Vive

TBD,Vive
"They took some getting used to, but now I really like them. I've had them for about 4 months and seen none of the hardware issues with them yet.

Fitting the hand straps is a little weird. You want to use the top adjustment to get the angle in your hand right, then the tightness should be a lot loser than I first expected. They stick to my hands quite well with minimal fuss. My hands seem to be very average, if you have very large, very small or just differently shaped hands they may not fit you as well.

Some older games don't work very well with them just because of the angle of the controllers in your hand. Beat saber is the biggest offender here, it works, but just does not feel as saber like as the wands. Other games need a little work to remap the controls to something that makes sense. (Skyrim VR default controls are completely unplayable)

The finger tracking is still kind of a gimmick, but fairly accurate, especially compared to oculous. Squeeze to grab things does feel very natural once you get the pressure set up right. The angle for shooting games is good as long as you have the top of the hand straps in the right position.",Vive

First wave buyer have no ragrets!  Far more comfortable than the wands.  Much better button placement.  The touch pad on the wands are a fucking joke compared to thumbsticks for movement as well.

The tripods take up barely any floor space. They take up 1 square foot each. I'd very much recommend them.,Vive
keep talking and nobody explodes works!,Vive
"They are too new to be getting a sale anytime soon, especially with the announcement that you're getting a $60 game for free when you buy them.",Vive
"i just got them today no problems with it. only issue i have to retrain my self. lol 

cramps in the fingers but other than that i can finally flick people off",Vive
"I agree that Cosmos is bad, but about the batteries - I really wish I had an option to get them in my Vive controllers - it's super convenient once you have two sets of them. I have this with the Steam Controller - you charge one pack while using the other, and then you just swap them. It's much more important with VR because you can't plug your controllers while playing",Vive
"It's highly individual. Some people love them, some hate them.",Vive
You won’t be able to flip off the Combine. Practically unplayable.,Vive
Exactly my thought,Vive
I would say the vive wands fit a lot better in my but,Vive
"I think you didn't read the comment correctly :)  I think it'll be too short, not too long.

Having played mostly OrbusVR (500+ hours) and BS (200+ hours),  15 hours feels very short.

But I guess we'll see !",Vive
FReality,Vive
Cool tech but barely anything that takes advantage of it.,Vive
I think they’re worth it because they bring more immersion.  You’ll have a few issues with games not natively designed for them but they work surprisingly well in most cases and emulate oculus touch controllers in Oculus games via revive.  And the future is bright with Boneworks and Alyx set to take full advantage in the months ahead.,Vive
Yes amazing,Vive
"Damn, what kind?",Vive
"If You have vive, it's a must.",Vive
"Usually if I notice it it’s for a bad reason when the IK screws up. Even in games where the IK is solid, the body is never in the right place to match mine. I find VR bodies much more distracting than immersive.",Vive
"I started playing half life 2 about a month ago. When I heard this announcement I went out and bought half life 1.

2 still looks decent. 1 is definitely dated graphic. The gameplay for both is good and, from what I've heard the story line is totally worth it. So, as long as you don't mind old graphics it is a good buy. They are also on steam sale right now (for obvious reasons).",Vive
They are releasing the engine and Gabe did say there would be three VR titles. So you will likely get your wish.,Vive
"Isn't the basic concept though that the aim swinging acts as a button press?

The real problem, imho, comes when you need to move your position while keeping your arms still (for shooting?).",Vive
"I went through hours of trying to fix it and it turned out the USB in the headset was in the wrong port. Make sure its in the middle USB port, not the one on the right. Probably not helpful but just in case.",Vive
"I went through hours of trying to fix it and it turned out the USB in the headset was in the wrong port. Make sure its in the middle USB port, not the one on the right. Probably not helpful but just in case.",Vive
Wouldn't be so sure. They may want to get this stuff out to the masses more. I would expect some type of sale for either the entire unit or just the knuckles at some point though.,Vive
Coming from a Rift Cv1 owner is it worth the upgrade? I'd have to basically go for the 1k unit for all the lighthouses etc. The Rift def could use some improvement in fidelity and SDE. Dunno if the jump to index would be that earth shattering to warrant over double the price.,Vive
Apple.....,Vive
"I 3d printed a couple of these:

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2805862

They use command strips, so they won't damage the wall, and the lighthouse can just slide in.  I put a layer of the fuzzy side of Velcro on the back of the lighthouse mount plate so it fits into the holder a bit more snugly.",Vive
"I personally thought they were worth it, but part of why is that probably my favorite games are all physics based. It also depends on how much you're willing to spend.",Vive
Played HL1 like 4 years ago and it was a blast.  Your mileage may vary,Vive
"I could have sworn it took me longer than that, but howlongtobeat says 13 hours for the main story, so I might be remembering incorrectly.",Vive
https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/c4iizj/_/,Vive
Yes,Vive
"I actualy beaten it on my phone... Controls sucked, but it was MILES better than any recent mobile game.

I would rate the ganes as following:

HL: 5.5/10 just annoying level desing, lot of backtracking
HL2: 7/10 pretty good, but get's bland and generic
HL2 ep.1: 6.5/10 kinda dissapointing, short
HL2 ep.2: 8.5/10 much more compelling than the previus games, the game had the my attention for the whole duration of it",Vive
"oh jeez, are we still having that argument after all these years.  At the end of the day I just want the best headset for the best price. I don't really care who does it. Sure, I would like software to run on all headsets but I'm not fanatical about it.",Vive
"Dont forget about boneworks on December 10th, that should get you to january maybe, then its just a month away",Vive
"From what I understand you can use steam controller dongle in place of, haven't tried that yet so cant help much there, (alt see if you can get one from htc support?) &lt;-- gl with that though",Vive
"The knuckles controllers are amazing primarily because you can let go of them. Then you can grab something else and then actually let go of that. 

It may sound silly but that difference really improves things for me.",Vive
"I mostly love them.

Depending on the shape and size of your hand they can be incredibly comfortable. The way they're strapped onto your hands so that you can ""hold"" them without holding them is big step forward for vr controllers.

The finger tracking is a gimmick at best. It's far from being reliable, and it's not even close to being precise enough to add much to immersion. Specifically it feels like: ""wow, I moved my fingers in real life and then the fingers in the game moved in a similar way!"" As opposed to ""wow, my fingers are in this game""

It's fun, but useless for pretty much any use. It's not reliable enough for gameplay, and not precise enough for emersion.",Vive
Same. I am trying to figure out how to use the vive controller as tracker now.,Vive
Half Life: The Pre-Sequel,Vive
"Are you saying that the angle that the sword protrudes from your hand is off? If so, that seems like an issue that could easily be solved by software in the same way that pistol whip or SPT have a gun angle slider. I haven't noticed the issue myself with vanishing realms, which is the only sword game that I've played recently. I'm not clear on why it would be different than the vive wands, is it just a matter of the game angling them to support the vive wands and not updating for the index controllers?",Vive
"It really depends upon what 1k is to you, hard for me to say.  It was a major upgrade over my vive- visually the sde effectively disappeared, the resolution went from ""good enough to still enjoy the game"" (vive) to ""good enough to not really care anymore"" (still room to improve of course).  The sound was a massive jump.  I feel like I have an unfair advantage in Pavlov, I can tell they are exactly at my 7 oclock or whatever, it feels very real without anything touching your ears.  The field of view growth isn't massive, but it is enough to finally dispel the last feeling of tunnel vision.",Vive
"They actually just said 3 days ago that all the levels are finally finished! They are now just fixing some crashes and performance issues, they will then realese beta on Steam ( some of these levels are already playble in Steam beta).",Vive
Games like Pavlov and Onward constantly have plenty of full lobbies. You can bet a Valve made shooter would enjoy the same success.,Vive
"Thanks for the link, I'll try and check it out",Vive
"I think so, but I'm biased in that VR is the one area in my life where I really spend money on myself. The cool-ness of being able to let go alone is pretty huge for me. The finger-tracking is, I think, a little oversold at this point. The reality is that there aren't any games yet that are using it in a hugely substantive way, and I think that games in the near future will also avoid it due to not wanting to segment the market. 

To be sure, games have it to look cool, but I can't think of anything other than the experience made by cloudhead specifically for the controllers (or moondust) that are creating actual features specifically for the controllers. The joystick is a nice addition for people who like sliding locomotion, and the trackpad is still kinda there if you don't. It's hard to really oversell the difference that being able to let go makes mentally though. Even apart from the obvious differences in throwing things for instance, it really is a pretty game-changing dynamic. And unlike magic leap for instance, you're still getting haptic feedback and a physical object to grab when you grab things. My favorite example is holding a bolt action rifle. One hand goes on the butt, the other on the muzzle? not sure what that part is called, the outer edge of the rifle to stabalize it. When you need to reload, you can just naturally let go of the butt with the right hand, grab the bolt pull it back, grab a bullet, put it in, push the bolt back, and grab the butt again. All of this feels like you're doing it. On a vive controller it would be cumbersome as hell to try this process. 

The one other thing that I would say is that the controller remapping thing that they have (like the steam controller one) is really sweet to use with the index controllers. I have my right grip in pavlov bound to dropping the clip, and my left grip bound to hitting the slide lock. Both grips are also bound to hold things, but at a lower pressure value. This means that I can keep holding the gun, drop the clip, let go of the gun with the left hand, grab a clip, toss it in, and then grab the gun to stablize it and automatically hit the slide lock so it's ready to fire. 

I would imagine that like pretty much everything that valve makes they will go on sale at some point... but given how much HL:A will push hardware sales I wouldn't expect it to happen at any point in the near future.",Vive
"What I mean is the sword will always be in one position, you can't move it inside the palm of your hand because it's strapped to your hand tight. The wands you can move inside your palm freely",Vive
"Hm, they look like they'd have a much larger footprint than that in all the product page photos I've seen but that's not as bad as I thought. It would still mean one of the lighthouses would be in the play area though, how do you deal with that?",Vive
"Oh, that looks good, thanks!",Vive
"The steam controller remapping function is rather robust, but you do have to fiddle with it to get it to do what you want. For instance, don't map grip to capsense directly, make it force aware so you have to actually grip the controller to activate it. Makes a world of difference.",Vive
"You should see the exact same quality with wireless as you do with wired. I don’t notice any blur with my wireless. If you’re only experiencing it with wireless, and no issue with wired (using the same graphics card), then it’s likely caused by something other then your GPU.",Vive
"Remove pulsating blurrynedd by disabling smooth motion.

Gpu would help with that, yes, wireless wouldnt matter much",Vive
"I would say it's worth it once enough games fully support it. With games like boneworks and half-life coming out, the time is very soon.",Vive
The only big issue i have noticed is loss of quality due to Cpu power not being enough as the wireless can use upto 30% on its own. So if your cpu is getting bottleneck say byebye to frames as well.,Vive
Get the Vive pro. Wireless is the single greatest vr feature. If black levels and colors matter that much too then yeah. Vive pro is a no brainier. Get the index controllers with them and it is the best possible experience.,Vive
"Huh, so are you holding the controller lower with the vive wands? Or, do you mean that you're turning the vive wand sideways or something? Wouldn't that make it impossible to hit the trigger / touchpad on it either way?",Vive
"The width of the feet of the tripod is adjustable, so I just keep it at the narrowest adjustment, which is actually less than 1 sqft but it's a good idea to give yourself a little extra room when estimating these things. Mine are next to my couch and a shelf so they don't intrude on my play space.",Vive
I'll see if I can make a gif when I get home!,Vive
Maybe u/_kevv_ can help you with that lol,Vive
"Thanks :-) You're not a dorito troll at all, you're a dorito stand up fella / lady.",Vive
I've yeeted a vive wand into drywall and it still works.,Vive
"To offer a counter opinion, I don't think wireless is important enough to not go index. I think that the wider fov is the most important factor and the black levels are not as big of a problem as people make it out to be.",Vive
"&gt;ve buyer have no ragrets!  Far more comfortable than the wands.  Much better button placement.  The touch pad on the wands are a fucking joke compared to thumbsticks for movement as well.  The only good thing about the wands is you can turn them into trackers after you buy the index controllers.

I was thinking about getting the Index controllers to replace my wands.  The haptic went out in one of my wands and thats no fun in Beat Saber.    I was thinking of selling them on Ebay to put that money towards the Index controllers.     My concern is if there is any reason why I would need the wands once I replace them.  Can you think of any reason?",Vive
"Sorry, is the argument supposed to become invalid after a certain amount of time or something?",Vive
"Yeah I’d like to see how half life takes advantage of them before switching over. I imagine they will though, it’s their tech so they’ve got motivation to support all the controllers have to offer.",Vive
"Yeah the Vive controllers are nearly indestructible. The Index controllers do seem less robust than the wands, but they aren’t “weak” or “flimsy”. The Index Controllers are still rather sturdy, just don’t expect to punch holes in your drywall.",Vive
Any games out today that use them to it s full advantage?,Vive
"Honestly, just being able to let go of the controller adds a ton to immersion. Throwing things like ‘nades feels really really natural so much so you don’t even have to think about it, you just throw. 

Also being able to open your hand to grab and pick up something is very immersive. Like guns on the floor in Pavlov or ammo on a shelf in Arizona Sunshine. 

I do agree that the actual analog finger tracking is underused, but the entire tech of the controller is easily used and implemented in a lot of games.",Vive
"I still have my wands for 3 reasons.  (A) So I can use them as trackers, (B) my kids seem to prefer the wands.  But they are small children so the index controllers are difficult to use with their small hands. (C) Just in case my index controllers have to be RMA'd, so I can still play while I wait for the RMA process to complete.",Vive
Get a swedish or Danish person to help you out,Vive
"I haven't really gone out of my way to search for an example... and nothing conspicuously comes to mind.   Someone might know, though.

  In my case, it was just the Revive stuff that made the huge difference.  Asgard's Wrath, vader immortal, journey of the gods, robo recall... All of those definitely benefit.  And just the comfort/form factor.  Never was a fan of the Vive wands.",Vive
"&gt;I don’t know how to link his username because it has \_ as the first and last character

You can use  \`\\\` as an escape

in markdown: `/u/\_kevv\_`",Vive
"Ah ok, many thanks",Vive
How many episodes will there be in total? Waiting for them all to be released before diving in.,Vive
I just wish I could get some knuckles with my rift. Wish there was a cheaper alternative to the index for me to buy,Vive
"When more games support them, I think so. I'll probably order a set for my Vive now that they are available in Canada and Boneworks is coming out.",Vive
"Well, Boneworks is coming on the 10th. And for someone like me, games like Pavlov, Blade and Sorcery and the occasional VRChat are simply much better with the knuckles.",Vive
3 is last one,Vive
IMHO yes.,Vive
"I might get some and see how they work out, I could put one by the sofa and the other on top of my sub, possibly. That's just under 1' wide and is almost exactly 1' deep so it might work. Thanks!",Vive
"My opinion is that LCD offers more universal improvements over OLED in current VR headsets. Sure in scenarios like horror games and space exploration the OLEDS has big advantages. However due to the difference in subpixel arrangements LCD displays looks more sharp and has less screen door effect. This is noticeable in any scenarios. Both HMDs have the same total number of pixels, but the Index has larger FOV which means the pixels are spread more apart. Reports confirm that the perceived clarity on both headsets is about the same, but the Index has noticeably improved FOV without compromising clarity.",Vive
"Why does every game need to be infinitely replayable? Cant we enjoy a game, finish and move on with our lives to other things?

I love UP, great movie but the fact that it ends doesnt make it worse.",Vive
"I assume he means he can't, for example, rotate the hilt in his hand to hold the blade extruding from the pinky-side of the palm.",Vive
He's not saying the initial position is wrong.  He's saying that you can't adjust the position by any other means other than moving your entire hand. The wands let you shift the sword orientation in your hand more like a real sword.,Vive
"Ah, ninja style. That makes sense. Though, that would mean that he couldn't hit the touchpad or buttons on it. I guess, you could do it just to look cool for a second and then fling it back the other way. Yep, you sold me on it, that's absolutely what he means. That's a fair criticism.",Vive
Not really. More so a lack of cutscenes so there is less interruption to gameplay.,Vive
"Yep, /u/blindmikey beat you to it by a minute or two, I get it now.",Vive
"I think with Half-Life is that it's just overrated, like the rest of Valve games.

Don't get me wrong. They are good. However, they are not groundbreaking in any fashion.",Vive
Just use Vorpx and you have the best thing ever: deep regular games with stereoscopic 3D without the gimmicky controls.,Vive
"Those controllers are expensive, But you could always resell you old controllers. And with the addition of the game it does make it more tempting.   


280-60(game) = 220  


220- $80\~ (original vive wands) = $140\~  


$140 after all this sounds much more tempting.  The cheapest they sold for on ebay is $250.",Vive
Arm swinging doesn't seem to get in the way of [this guy](https://youtu.be/J7mgE8G0MrA),Vive
"It comes free with the index controllers?

Dammit!

I just purchased them a month ago!",Vive
"Nearly indestructible?! I run a VR arcade and couldn’t disagree more, the saucer at the top is a real weak point, I’ve have 8 controllers snapped in half so far.",Vive
"You have to buy a steam dongle and then flash the firmware in both the dongle and the wand.

**Name:** POLYBIUS

**Price:** $17.99

**Supported Platforms:** Windows

#About This Game

POLYBIUS is a fast, trippy tunnel shooter playable on a normal screen or in VR
for the best effect. It features 50 levels of blissful trance shooting action
set to a blistering soundtrack. The PS4 version was EDGE Magazine's VR GOTY in
2017, and the PC version of the game was even used as the basis for a NIN
music video. So put on your trance trousers, bust out the Oculus if you have
one, and strap in for a euphoric ride.  
  
  
  
Blast, boost and fly through 50 geometrical environments. Hit the boost gates
to increase your speed. How fast dare you go? More speed means more points but
also more danger!  
  
  
  
Pick up powerup pills along the way to increase your firepower, become
invincible, launch yourself to stratospheric speeds, even slow down time.  
  
  
  
POLYBIUS is designed to bring you quickly to a euphoric flow state, and to
keep you there the whole time you are playing. There are no bosses to spike
your progress, and the game will never make you redo sections - progress made
is progress kept, always, even if you lose a life. We want you to come out of
every game of Polybius, whether or not you've beaten your highscore, smiling
and happy because you've enjoyed the act of playing so much.  
  
  
  
Drop in for a quick blast or settle in for a long trip with Llamasoft's tried
and true arcade game modes: Pure (start from the beginning and see how far you
can get), Endurance (start from the beginning with a fixed number of lives, no
extras are awarded during Endurance games), or Normal.  
  
  
  
In a Normal Mode game, you can choose to restart from any level you have
previously arrived at. Our Restart Best system starts you off with the best-
ever lives and score that you've had at that point in any game previously.
Over time you can dip in and improve the individual Restart Best stats for any
of the levels and gradually build a platform for achieving better and better
high scores.  
  
  
  
The inspiration for POLYBIUS was an old urban legend about a strange,
abstract, psychedelic arcade game that was supposedly released for a brief
time in the 1980s. According to the legend people who played the game
experienced strange and rather unpleasant psychological reactions after
becoming addicted to it. There was talk of the CIA and Men in Black. Of course
the legendary game has never actually been found but - especially with the
advent of VR - we thought it might be fun to make a game inspired by the old
legend. Our version is intended only to have positive effects on the minds of
its users though!  
  
  
  
Don't just take our word for it, read for yourself some quotes from PS4
players after getting their hands on POLYBIUS!  
  
  
  
**POLYBIUS! I can't believe a game can make me feel such joy. Thank you @llamasoft_ox for an incredible experience!**  
  
Polybius is easily one of the best immersive PSVR showcases, alongside Rez
Infinite, Thumper and SuperHyperCube - amazing work.  
  
**The difference between non-VR and VR modes is incredible - even the title screen is astonishing. @llamasoft_ox has found his ideal canvas :)**  
  
@llamasoft_ox what have you done to my brain?  
  
**@llamasoft_ox thx for providing such a wonderful VR gaming xperience. Most immersive, fun and addictive #psvr game so far!**  
  
I think it's the best game you have ever written, it's fucking epic! Nice one
mate :-)  
  
**Any initial WTF? Confusion of #Polybius is soon replaced with euphoria &amp; a great big grin. Amazing work @llamasoft_ox and all involved**  
  
Polybius from @llamasoft_ox has the most *brilliant* 3D TV mode - great fun
even without PSVR. First reason I’ve ever had to switch TV to 3D  
  
**#Polybius in VR. Blimey. Words can't begin to describe it. Never before has a videogame given me a headrush. My compliments to @llamasoft_ox**  
  
What you can't hear in this POLYBIUS (PSVR) clip is me laughing w/delight; thx
@llamasoft_ox  
  
**Oh My God. Polybius is the best PSVR game by a mile. If you have a PSVR, you *need* this game.**  
  
Polybius wow ! Played to level 20 and now I feel chiiiiiiiiiiled 🐑 first time
in ages I am not worrying myself sick. 10/10  
  
**Get #Polybius by @llamasoft_ox for PSVR. It's gorgeous, mind warping and extremely fun. Very inspirational as well!**  
  
Shout out to #Polybius and @llamasoft_ox. Great game. I wondered what an 80s
shooter would feel like inside an arcade game. This is it #psvr  
  
**Halted my POLYBIUS time until tomorrow but let the eldest have a go before bed and as I was making a brew, all I could hear was laughter.**  
  
So if you have a PSVR then you need to get Polybius. If you don't have a PSVR
then get one and get Polybius. My word @llamasoft_ox  
  
**So far Polybius by @llamasoft_ox is incredible and doesn't want to let me go.. love it!**  
  
Well #Polybius is ridiculous. When you are really going + the screen is
pulsing, colours separating — I think I taste colour.  
  
**Blimey! Just played Polybius, the most intense legal trip you’ll ever take. Legendary work @llamasoft_ox this is THE reason for having PSVR**  
  
1st VR Polybius run. Holy mackerel! You get in a trance zone, when you finally
run out of shields, you're like what day is it @llamasoft_ox  
  
**#Polybius is ridiculous fun @llamasoft_ox has absolutely nailed it!**  
  
Blew the dust off the psvr for @llamasoft_ox Polybius. Techno goodness.
IncrediBull  
  
**@llamasoft_ox Dude, you *so* nailed it. Relaxed into the game tonight and did so much better. All the things you spoke about - delivered.**  
Go with the flow is about all the instruction you need for Polybius. I should
be in bed but here I am. Beautiful. Thanks @llamasoft_ox  
  
**Seriously, I have the *biggest* grin on my face right now, and it’s all @llamasoft_ox’s fault. #polybius**  
  
@llamasoft_ox New Jeff game... Download NOW and... 4K 60fps = amazing! Plug in
PSVR... I HAVE NO WORDS!!! 30 years I been waiting for this!  
  
Oh my god you guys smashed it :D and the music is magic , a very happy chappy
indeed  
  
**Now that I've finished mopping up the brains dribbling from my ears...moar #Polybius**  
  
congrats to @llamasoft_ox it's finally out everyone go buy it your life will
never be the same again.  
  
**thank you llamasoft!! Best VR game I've ever played! No motion sickness (finally), super fast, just amazing.**  
  
I really don't know what to say. @llamasoft_ox Polybius on PS4VR is freaking
incredible.U just get so consumed by it 😁😁😁 great music as well  
  
**can’t. stop. playing. Polybius. It has a tru**",Vive
Have they sorted out the lag issues?,Vive
I've never used arm swinging as the stick movement works well for me. It would be cool if it could work.,Vive
"It seems that Alyx will heavily showcase the full extent of what you can do with the new Index controllers as well as release all kinds of developer goodies for modding. The game giving developers an in-depth demo of what they can do with the Index controllers will likely lead to both more retrofitting of Index controls into existing content and lead to new content supporting it out of the box and in a more integrated way.

In short, yeah, I think the Index controllers are probably the most worthwhile upgrade right now if you're only going to get part of the Index platform.",Vive
You get Alyx for free just by owning them. :D,Vive
"Really? Awesome! Thanks for the heads up, my dude!",Vive
"Yep, maybe I'll consider index (obscenely priced as it is) if they release an adapter... But right now the wire is a deal breaker.",Vive
Just a side note that they emulate Oculus controllers quite well if you're planning on ever using revive for anything,Vive
"To be honest having used all the major controllers, the index controllers still are the best by far, even for the games that don't take direct advantage of all their features.",Vive
OH THAT'S WHY I RECOGNIZED THE VOICE,Vive
That is going to make so many people sick. The Great C was bad enough with its constant speed camera movements and being 6DOF. I can't imagine the nausea a moving 3DOF action movie will induce.,Vive
"Flat screen gaming isn't going anywhere, but Valve's latest entry being a VR exclusive might lead to a significant adoption of the tech by the player base.

Instead of being 1-2% of the player base, this might lead to 5%.

And with this kind of adoption (and potential sales numbers), more developers will chance making a VR exclusive (or compatible) game.

It will help make the rolling snowball a bit bigger... and maybe it won't show signs of slowing down this time around.",Vive
Maybe why its only 15 minutes? Stomach endurance run?,Vive
"From what I'm seeing, new controllers and replacements have not had the hardware issues we've been hearing about. They've probably corrected the production issues for the controllers at this point.",Vive
Some people are still having issues. I saw one redditor on their 6th RMA yesterday.,Vive
"i help out at the VR arcade in my town from time to time as a close friend is the one who runs it, and they actually have these little rollcage-esque things that attach to the controllers to give more rigidity to the rings on the top of the controllers, as well as act as a bumper for the outside of it.

not sure the name of it, but i've seen some of the accidents that happen there and they've sure helped prolong the life of the controllers.",Vive
Yep,Vive
I'm not familiar with what issue you're speaking of,Vive
"Hey everyone, just looking for some insight. Is it possible to play together with my friend if he has a vive and i have an oculus?",Vive
Congrats!,Vive
Hey thanks! No need to said that I ordered one right?,Vive
If you can get the headset without the vive controllers for cheaper then do that and get the index controllers plus a wireless adapter and the audio strap and you’ll be as close to ready player one as you can get for now,Vive
"I must admit, I only saw the finger tracker soon after it was released, but it was showing some serious lag between movement and what you could see in VR. 

I’m guessing by your questioning that it’s no longer an issue?",Vive
"2nd hand Vive with base stations off ebay+ knuckles is an option. Whether it's financially worth it really depends on your luck, but it works perfectly.",Vive
"If you don't want to spend the money upgrading to the Index, the Vive doesn't make sense anymore. And especially your GPU is too weak to really use the Index anyway.

I'd say these should be your main options: Samsung Odyssey+, Oculus Rift S, Oculus Quest",Vive
"Litterally the only downside I've experienced with my controllers is having to relearn the saber angle on beat saber, but now I'm even better. They're great for games like pavlov",Vive
I've heard some people got knuckles and a rift to work together if you can find the base stations cheap,Vive
"Looks like Half Life Alyx so powerful, the website title of steamvr.com is just ""Half-Life"" now",Vive
"Plus with the Pro you have to option of instant wireless and the Gear vr lens nod drops straight in for crystal clear, edge to edge clarity, look round with your eyes, no sweet spot, no glare or godrays... and AMLOED screens, not just std OLED",Vive
"It depends on the game. If the game is multiplayer and on Steam, yes, because as much as Oculus wants to cover it up, SteamVR does work with the Rift. (Unless you have a Quest.)",Vive
"Can't say I agree with you. I can remember of several examples of environmental storytelling in half life. 

Like when you see the playground in the beginning is hard not think about were are the children. Or when you are driving around the coast and you see all the empty houses with a bunch of burned bodies in the back, or why the sea level is so low...

Most of these details aren't explained to us and we have to fill the gaps and paint a mental picture about what kind of world we are living.",Vive
You're right. It was Chet I was thinking of sand he doesn't even work at valve anymore. My bad https://www.geek.com/games/valve-confirms-half-life-3-will-not-be-a-virtual-reality-game-1635064/,Vive
I use my Vive wands for Gorn. No way in hell am I risking my new Index Controllers.,Vive
"Although Samsung odyssey + or oculus rift sound awesome, their requirements are windows 10 and im still stitting on old win 7 D: 

And for the oculus quest, its game library seems quite small :/",Vive
"You're not really saying that you don't want to upgrade? Win7 is **10** years old. Support will end in January.

And for the Quest, you can connect it to a PC with an USB cable.",Vive
"A quick google search shows that if there was an issue, it was slight, and was updated out of existence... 
That, and exact finger tracking is still fairly irrelevant.  Button presses do not lag.",Vive
So the finger tracking no longer lags? That’s good to hear.,Vive
What kind of games/applications are trackers good for?,Vive
Or you could just not beat up the room while playing. /s,Vive
"My wands have taken a pretty big beating. They've definitely had the reality drywall experience. I once had to take one apart and reconnect a ribbon cable (it was really simple). Otherwise, they've been beasts for me.

I dropped an Index wand from waist height onto hard flooring and it stopped tracking. RMA was quick and painless, but yeah.

Maybe the Vive wands aren't indestructible, but they're probably harder to break than the Knuckles. Probably mostly because the Knuckles has an insane number of components inside of it for all of the tracking.

I like them both as far as usability goes. I don't really have a strong opinion on one over the other. I still hope that'll change once software starts using finger tracking.",Vive
Awesome thanks for the quick reply.,Vive
"The best exhibit to show off how dope the new controllers are is Superhot VR. I *HATED* throwing things in that game with the vive wands because it was just awkward as fuck to press the grip buttons at the correct moment.

Index controllers took a little feeling out, but the throwing motion with the touch grip is substantially more immersive.",Vive
"Onward had a peak playerbase of 363 players, and pavlov had 1200 players. Those are really small numbers, and even if Valve's was higher, it still is too low for a decent player base.

I'm glad they're focusing on a good singleplayer experience, and not compromising it for a tacked on multiplayer part.",Vive
"&gt; but poor contrast and grey blacks are a borderline dealbreaker to me

I think this blown way out of proportion. I own the Index and I value the headset more than the controllers and would take it over any other headset on the market, in a heartbeat.",Vive
"I have had the controllers since V1 and I have had 0 instances of drift. I technically have the thumbstick click issue, but it seems less of a problem with my controllers since while I might not hear/feel the 'click', the action is still executed in game.

It seems to vary from person to person, such a shame that some people have to RMA a couple times where I never really had to.",Vive
"In short, not many. Pavlov, The Lab, Superhot, and H3VR are the 4 that come to mind off of the top of my head. I haven't tried it personally, but I would imagine that the gallery games do due to the developer making the knuckles tech demo. Arizona sunshine does kinda, but it's really badly implemented in several ways. As you say, there are a lot of games that work with them and don't have any issues, but that there really isn't a reason to do it. Pistol whip comes to mind.",Vive
"Hmm, those games use full finger tracking? Interesting",Vive
"I think the finger tracking point is spot on only because it's an incredibly new set of ""tools"" for people to use. I've been working in Unity to make use of the finger tracking, like having a miniature menu appear when you look at your arm (like checking the time on a watch), and using fingers/pinching movements to select, drag, and drop items.

In the API you have access to the finger position values, it's just a matter of using them and refining the accuracy",Vive
"When I play beat saber I don't strap my hands to the controllers and I hold them at around 90degrees of rotation compared to how they are normally held. It helped the ""sword feel"" a lot for me.",Vive
"In short, the list of games is small because the finger tracking tech is pretty new. I've been messing with the API and the information is all there (individual finger position values is the big feature I think people notice).

The knuckles have a few other benefits over the Vive wands.

* Strapped to your hand. It's minor, but such a huge difference from having to ""actively"" hold the Vive wands like TV remotes. I have less hand/arm fatigue after long play sessions (just don't make the straps TOO tight! Keep them loose but firm)
* Lighter and ""smaller"". The tracking bar sometimes gets in the way of things, but rarely. Just be careful in Beat Saber
* THUMBSTICKS. While most VR games don't support/feature finger tracking, having thumbsticks is such a nice feature. Movement is less awkward since it's not bound to that stupid trackpad.
* More natural ""grip"" control. The grip buttons on the Vive wands fucking suck, especially if you are like me and have rubber sleeves over them to protect from nicks and scratches. Knuckles ""grip"" button is more of a sensor seeing if your hand is closed or not. There is a force sensor in the grips as well, so there is a difference between a **HARD** grip and a light grip. (again, devs need to take these force readings and implement them, but the easier grip ""button"" is just a nice upgrade)",Vive
"I bought them a few months ago, absolutely amazing and improves every game that supports them. They feel great in the hand, and it makes gameplay so much more natural, especially picking up and throwing objects. The added bonus of free HLA makes the purchase even better.",Vive
"It automatically showed up in my account, and I only bought the controllers. I don't see how anyone could transfer the game to anyone else.",Vive
"If you're using Natural Locomotion they're good for feet tracking in something like 50 games.  Pavlov, Onward, Skyrim, most of the really popular games.",Vive
Is there a link to that statement you can share. I can't find it anywhere.,Vive
"If possible, find somewhere to try them both. Everyone has different preferences in terms of their priorities about what makes a good VR experience. I tried a vive Pro instore and was not impressed at all.  Based on sweet spot, clarity and comfort.",Vive
"its usually gonna default to you facing the widest wall. Go into advanced mode after drawing out your square, click advanced and it will let you rotate/shrink the play space within the box you outlined.",Vive
"Hilariously, after playing a few hours of Skyrim VR, I realized that having it be in VR actually fixed a HUGE problem I had with games like Skyrim. Namely: the broken loot economy

In 2D Skyrim, I was looting every goddamn urn/chest/body/sack/shelf in the game, and would regularly end up with so much gold I could buy anything I wanted with no real cost. I would run out of vendors to sell things to, so I would mod the game to give them more starting gold to exchange.

In VR though, physically reaching over to loot everything was EXHAUSTING. The action itself wasn't bad, but doing it over and over and over **and over and over again** got real boring, tedious, and would burn way more calories than expected. I would enter a room with a hundred urns, groan, then just ignore them all.

Suddenly, I was having to pick and choose what to carry, what to loot, and in effect, balanced the game's economy. I would have to consider which armor to buy from a vendor, or save up to get a nice weapon upgrade.

Also playing a mage in Skyrim works so much better in VR than it did in 2D. Get some Mage specific mods (and voice command mods) and you have a whole new game to enjoy",Vive
"The tracking ring can snap but in the three times it happened to me, it was always repairable. It always pulled out a ribbon cable and could pretty much be snapped back together. I have lost a little bit of plastic (a bit that latches the controller together) and one sensor, but it seems fine.",Vive
"&gt;I dropped an Index controller from waist height onto hard flooring and it stopped tracking.

Wow, that sounds really concerning. I was always imagining the knuckles would be less prone to breakage, but that was just based on them not having such an obvious snap point with the tracking ring.

Sounds like I should maybe give HTC some props for build quality.",Vive
"This third episode is so bad, don't buy it.",Vive
"Yeah, I’m talking about a bit more than it popping out of place, these were full broken in half. Plastic snapped, HTC refused to repair.",Vive
"&gt; just being able to let go of the controller adds a ton to immersion

This will require game support though, unless it uses the grip buttons for holding things, right?",Vive
Literally the half life alyx website.,Vive
Can the Steam dongles be bought separately? What exactly makes them different from a standard Bluetooth single?,Vive
"&gt; and you can show rude gestures in online games while other people cant :)

Clearly a reason alone to buy them. To assert dominance on other vr users.",Vive
Shouldn't the Quest work just fine now that they've opened the beta for the Link cable?,Vive
Yes I have them and they're amazing,Vive

No. You use airpods much more frequently than you would these controllers.,Vive

"I bet. Been trying to play Asgard's Wrath on Vive wands right now. The game is incredible but the ""sticks"" being essentially on top of the buttons makes moving around and interacting a nightmare.",Vive
Very strange that they're not shipping to Bulgaria even though that is an EU country.,Vive
"So far, so good.",Vive
https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7077-YUOA-2321 it’s on the list ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,Vive
"Oddly, the games I love playing the most with them so far are Asgard's Wrath and Stormland. In Asgard's Wrath my favorite thing to do after knocking an enemies shield down (if needed) is spam throwing swords/axes at their heads while avoiding damage using the thumb stick, which ends up being a pretty good arm work out.  The smooth movement system in Stormland and specifically climbing/gliding around feels pretty awesome too.  I also prefer the Index form factor while playing Beat Saber and Pistol Whip, it's subtle, but feels right.

 Note: I turned my knuckles grab sensitivity down after it was causing issues in Swords &amp; Sorcery, but I'm not sure that affects other games.

One thing to keep in mind is that Half Life Alex and Index were co-developed together.  The interactions in HLA were being used to define the inputs required for the Index controller.  And since the Index is relatively new, it'll take some time for developers to take full advantage of it.  The challenging aspect is that it takes quite a bit of work to add in the fine tuned Index specific details that won't be available to other motion controllers, so I don't expect too many games to take full advantage of it anytime soon.  However, HLA has the potential to create a new VR ecosystem of interactive content using the new Source 2 Hammer VR toolset which will be released along with the game.  This will enable moders to create new content and games similar to the start of Counter Strike and a handful of others.  If those take off I could see the amount of available content that make full use of the knuckles increase exponentially.",Vive
Get a Quest it’s the most amazing piece of VR hardware ever made!!!!!!,Vive
You mean the one airpod?,Vive
I've been playing Stormland lately.  I tried wands yesterday. Can't imagine playing this game without knuckles.,Vive
Do you only need one or is it one per wand?,Vive
I also have large hands. If I end up ordering them i'll have to do the 3d printed grips because they really werent' comfy. The joystick isn't positioned well either,Vive
so glad i’m not the only one who found issue with the index controllers in beat saber. that’s my go to game and i really don’t like it with the index controllers.,Vive
"Yes, it should if connected, but on it's own it's more game-dependant.",Vive
It is sometimes fun to play with open hands and karate chop the blocks... But beat saber was really designed around holding sticks.,Vive
Gorn has done more damage to my furniture than my puppy.,Vive
Just don't hurt your puppy!,Vive
Honestly the next killer feature for VR is going to be dog tracking. I need a chaperone alert of some sort.,Vive
I have the wireless vive pro right now. If it weren't wireless I would have gotten the index to replace my vive pro. Use that information how you will.,Vive
"If you like RPGs or more similar comparison games like Zelda, check out Shadow Legend VR. I had a blast with it and it has Knuckles support. It doesn't really capitalize on them too much, but the game itself is really cool.",Vive
Thanks dude I’ll check it out,Vive
Yes. I have had very few issues and any game with actual bindings is much better with them.,Vive
Asking the important questions!,Vive
People who stubbornly sit on Win 7 always remind me of the boomers who refuse to use Led lightbulbs because they are newer and slightly different so they must be bad,Vive
"The FOV is exactly the same as with the wands, disappointingly.",Vive
"Actually yes, because after nearly 4 years we can see that oculus did not destroy VR with their practices. If anything they're probably more popular now than before. At the end of the day people vote with their cash and generally speaking people are happy with oculus and their offerings.  I have a Vive and nothing else, but come this black Friday I'm seriously considering getting a Rift-S as its a spec upgrade and at decent price. Once I have both Rift-S and Vive any discussions associated with exclusive software is rendered mute as I can swap headset as required. Now if only Sony PS would stop  with their ""restrictive exclusivity"" we could all get some sleep.",Vive
"It depends on  the game you play. If you play fps most of the  time, get index. Pavlov in index is better than it in Pro. I play SkyrimVR and Beat Saber most of the time, sold my vive pro when index arrived, spent 3 months trying to get used to LCD screen, finally bought a Vive Pro back.

But chances are if you never use VR before, you will not notice any difference.",Vive
Fujii is simple but beautiful and makes great use of them.,Vive
"I like them, there isn't many games that use the features too much and those that do are just a simple add on for it. You get to see your fingers move but don't really add much to gameplay. 
We are still waiting for that killer app and so far we now know what that app will be.",Vive
[removed],Vive
[Surv1v3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/722180/SURV1V3/) hands down. I don't understand how this game isn't more popular - Arizona Sunshine has nothing on it.,Vive

I just use the Saber Tailor mod to readjust the angle to where I was used to it with the Vive wands when I'm playing with the Index controllers,Vive
"Does the ""Extra content"" like the gun skins come with the controllers too? Or is that just for the full index?",Vive
You haven't played Half Life in VR yet? It's pretty cool from what I hear.,Vive
What is your CPU?,Vive
"I think this is more of a limitation on the games side of things. Most games (for example Skyrim) the sword replaces your in game hands. Making the controller mapped 1:1 with the sword. this works really well for the Vive Wands especially for swords. However the index controls with the fancy finger tracking I would argue that they should always be mapped 1:1 with your in game hands never something something your in game hands are holding.

For example in a game like Boneworks you could just rotate the sword around in your hands and re grab them for the ground stab.",Vive
One dongle per wand,Vive
"VRChat definitely uses the finger tracking which helps a lot in expressing myself without using the wrong gesture because my thumb touched slightly wrong with the Vive wand touch pad. Beat Saber's custom avatars mod is now utilizing the finger tracking as well, but there aren't many avatars that are compatible yet. It's a brand new feature for the mod.",Vive
"I’m not entirely sure, but I would assume yes because of the phrasing “index hardware”.",Vive
"Since rift is compatible with steam VR, you could definitely use the knuckles, just would need base stations.  So two tracking set ups",Vive
"I’ve never tried the index but I have a wireless vive pro with gear lenses and it is amazing. I just ordered the knuckles as well, cannot wait.


IMO wireless is basically necessary and you can never go back",Vive
There's a mod that allows you to adjust the angle of your saber compared to your controller that may solve your problem!,Vive
"Considering Valve is wanting to revolutionize VR the way they did 3D games  with HL2 I think Alyx needs arms; maybe they should have developed some kind of sleeve or something to track peoples forearms. 

I don't know??? it annoys me enough that I won't invest. If Valve want to really push the envelope then arms are a must at a minimum.",Vive
What generation is your cpu? “i5” is pretty vauge. When was the last time you updated your drivers?,Vive
"I thought you threw with triggers in that game, unless its a gun, then you just click the grip at the point where you release?

I'll agree that it's still awkward as hell, but I didn't think it was as bad as ""unsteadying"" a gun in pavlov, where you have to squeeze the grip to *let go of a gun*, which was the most unnatural thing ever for me.",Vive
Do the vive trackers work with the index controllers?,Vive
Was UP the killer movie for you that kept you coming back for more?,Vive
Wait. They said they're making 3 vr games.  Did they backtrack on that?,Vive
They didn't even talk about any other games. Just HL and the engine and the tools they will release to let the community build what they want.,Vive
Yup,Vive

I can appreciate the notion of a hand held mount for VR devices as a useful 3D visualization tool. But... I don't know... isn't it easier just to build some sort of 3D printed jig that can go around an existing headset?,Vive
I was referring to op’s long list of not-killer-apps,Vive
Elite Dangerous and Fallout comprise hundreds of hours of my VR time. Maybe 100 to 200 per game. They're phenomenal,Vive
The battery lasts six hours? I might buy one for my Vive Pro,Vive
Yes from me as well. I used a USB headset through the port in the headset. No issues when I did it.,Vive
"I'm digging the art style and physics a lot. The tron music makes me feel all tingly too.

My only concern so far is with the enemies and their lethality. In every encounter in this trailer, enemies were momentary obstacles that seemed to not really pose any threat and were dispatched with either a single hit or by being thrown. Can enemies kill you just as easily? Obviously I don't expect them to grab you and throw you around, but it would be nice to feel like my survival depends on me being effective at defending myself and not just killing things that seemingly have no way of fighting back effectively.",Vive
I agreed with you that the OP did not appear to understand what 'killer app' means.  So I gave him the Wikipedia definition.,Vive

"&gt; Epic is well known for paying for exclusivity.

Cyberpunk 2077 isn't exclusve, and neiter are Klei's games.

&gt; There have been a bunch of cases where devs who declined Epic's offering have stated how much they would've given.

I couldn't find any instances of this, which makes sense since negotiations would likely take place after signing a confidentiality agreement.

There was IIRC a game where this leaked through sales reports though, and it was around €10 million.",Vive
"Not to mention the TPCast is only \~$30 cheaper than the official first party supported adapter.

I have the Vive wireless adapter on an OG Vive with the deluxe audio strap and have noticed that it gets uncomfortable on my scalp about 2 hours in.

Also the official battery does not last 6 hours (at best you're getting about 3 hours), however you can use 3rd party batteries that support  QC 3.0. I have a [Anker battery](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N3TVRP2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) that costs less than the Vive one and lasts twice as long. The only caveat is that it takes forever to charge. I typically charge it overnight.",Vive
Right. Carry on then XD,Vive
"My first thought was, looks clunky. Might not be, can't really tell if the footage is cherry-picked or what normal gameplay looks like, but if this is as good as it gets, still looks pretty unnatural feeling.",Vive
"You can't just try it with any game. Games are marked as compatible or not after testing. I do not know if any VR games are marked as compatible. 

You could try what you're hoping for with Proton.",Vive
"I should mention that I bought a much much larger battery that's able to last for 10 hours. The one they give you with the adapter lasts abouuuut 3 hours or so, so I'd recommend obtaining [the bigger one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K6TA748/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)",Vive

But thanks for going out and linking them for me, much appreciated.",Vive
RemindMe! six months,Vive
Oh I didn't realize they had to be marked as compatible. Thanks for the heads up.,Vive
This can’t be possible. There’s still going to be some kind of lag. I can’t believe wifi could have “near zero latency”. It’s just not possible.,Vive
That's what I thought until they canonized it within the anime at the start of the latest season by referencing it.,Vive
yes it is.,Vive
i want an index v2 thats higher res and wireless,Vive
"I have. It's a tad shallow if you like RTS games but it's very enjoyable. 

The presentation and art is really polished too.

[What about Football VR Tournament with Vive Trackers?](/r/Vive/comments/dzhjka/what_about_football_vr_tournament_with_vive/) by  FreakyTrane3


First video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPbYlzF7XDQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPbYlzF7XDQ) 

This man plays Final Soccer VR with Vive Trackers: it works but there are only free kicks.

Second video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBBi\_TwKZ7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBBi_TwKZ7A) 

This man plays Football VR Tournament 2018 with PSVR, using his legs: you can play a match, but I don't know if it works properly.

And so here is my question: can I play Football VR Tournament (playing a match), using Vive Trackers. It would be amazing, I would play a ""real"" proper virtual game!

&gt;The time **to infer a FullHD frame on 4x NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs** is 9ms. The DeepFovea model has 3.1 million parameters and requires 111 GFLOP with 2.2GB memory footprint per GPU for an inference pass. ... Time to sparsify a frame on a single GPUis 0.7ms.

Naturally, from each sparse input frame, you need to infer(fill in) the full HD(1920x1080 total res - not per eye here) and that needs four Tesla V100 GPUs!

" Lens adaptor for HTC Vive VR to replace Fresnel lenses / Gear VR / or Carl Zeiss with 52mm Aspheric lens from BOBOVR Z6

This mod is for the original HTC Vive only, not Pro or cosmos, while these lens and adaptors may fit I don't have these headsets to create any kind of calibration settings.

The BOBOVR Z6 uses a large 52mm (43mm usable area) clear aspheric hyperboloid lens lens which fits perfectly into the HTC Vive, unfortunately there is a slight difference in focal length therefore requiring adaptors. The BOBO lenses are fitted to the headset by a snap fit ring which can be carefully released by separating it from the base then used to fit over these adaptors. The only disadvantage is acquiring the BOBO headset and cost around $24 shipped from china.

The overall result is an almost factory finish with the lenses only protruding around 5mm from the original lens allowing greater room for glasses wearers. Clarity and sweet spot is equivalent or better than the common Gear VR modification.

In addition field of view is the same or actually greater both horizontally and vertically than original lenses (at same scale). Chromatic aberration is almost identical or better than original, however there is some slight barrel distortion and pupillary swim which can be mostly removed by calibration. (see calibration figures below). However headset placement on the face is more critical. IPD distance seems to be better if adjusted to approx 3mm less than actual IPD. Godrays are better than original or mostly equivalent to Gear VR lens. The only perceived disadvantage is there is some slight reflective/refraction of out of site image at the very edges of the lens.

Its a slightly preferable mod to the Gear VR lens mod as with the wider fov it more immersive and feels less like wearing binoculars.

Note. I originally made these adaptors at a height of 5.74mm however on testing the focus wasn't actually quite perfect so have manually modified them to improve this (with some small blobs of blutac currently, this may be due to margin of error from the prints as one eye seems better than the other even though its the same part so I have modified the model to a depth of 6mm for better tolerance but I don't actually own a 3d printer to test this or other variations, sending these out to print adds more cost, so as such this version is untested but should be ok, maybe I'll be lucky and Santa will bring bring me a printer).",Vive
"Instructions to apply calibrate the headset better to the lenses (this is based on my own headset so you may need to tweak your values to suit).

Plug in your HMD, turn on lighthouses, run steam.

1. Go to: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SteamVR\\tools\\lighthouse\\bin\\win32\\
2. Run: lighthouse\_console.exe
3. Download your current config, using command: downloadconfig og\_vive\_config.json  
(ensure your headset is in view of lighthouses and display is on by activating proximity sensor, otherwise you will get an error such as""Expected 3502 bytes of config but only found 2418. Rejecting config Unable to read config from device""
4. File will be saved in the current directory(make many backups, email it to yourself, save it on a cloud drive etc. so you can reverse this mod if necessary). Make a copy calling it something new such as ""mod\_config.json"" and replace the ""tracking\_to\_eye\_transform"" section with the settings below. (leave all the other code alone).
5. Upload a new config with the ""lighthouse\_console.exe"" using command: uploadconfig mod\_config.json
6. Restart SteamVR and check the result.

To reverse the process just upload the original config file.

"Why do they claim a 10-14x reduction in compute? Is it because the frame with those GPUs would take even longer because of how HD they are?

Regardless, if AI patterns have shown anything, its that algorithms like this can be optimized to be even faster. Think about the status of stylechange filters taking minutes per image, but now we have realtime filters.",Vive

"&gt;The music does half the job that usually developers have to work to create.

You do realize that the beatmaps are manually created, right? They're not generated ""by the game"", someone has to take the time and map them out? And then on top of mapping them out in the first place, to do so in a way that's either fun and/or challenging while still allowing for a steady flow of movement?",Vive
So glad it can be played on Oculus too!,Vive
"I disagree, and the reason is because it's a niche.

Yes, look, I get it, it might be a HUGE niche, but it's still a rhythm game. Some people just despise rhythm games, as the guy below illustrates. Just like you wouldn't have been able to sell the PS2 (let's pretend it didn't succeed the PS1 for a moment) on a DDR mat or Guitar Hero controller, so too is pointing at a rhythm game like BS as a clear, objective example of a killer app faulty.

I enjoy it as much as you, but there's no denying that something like Half Life is more appealing to a massive audience than, say, OSU, even if a LOT of people like OSU and those who do like it are respectively stronger fans of it than most of the HL fans are of that game.",Vive
Half Life: Source is more playable than the original imo.,Vive
I'm here 38 minutes into the post. Go valve go!,Vive
I KNOW RIGHT. It's probably gonna sell out so fast so shh haha.,Vive
"Half Life 3 ... confirmed?  


Does this count?",Vive
Can you play just Half Life 1 and then move onto Half Life 2: Ep 1 then 2 or do you really have to play the other random games? Blue Shift etc?,Vive
enticing proposition to get index controllers if it comes with HLA for free to pair with the vive...,Vive
I'll be buying Index controllers now.,Vive
Do you have a link?,Vive
"Nah, it's a prequel.",Vive
"it's still missing the last 5 levels, they're close.",Vive
"I have played Carly and the Reaperman with a friend that dont feel passion for vr and have a not so good internet and it worked really well. Moreover he lives in another country and remote play is the only way I could show him the vr appealing (appart of vr chat, the forest or payday) with  more vr interactions and now he wants one :p. Other game that is listed is the dinner duo.",Vive
"The finger tracking adds immersion, and Valve specifically designed the game with the Index controller in mind. The fact that they're offering the game for free to anyone who buys the controllers indicates that Valve really wants you to play the game with them",Vive
"I wonder what the locomotion is like, any word?",Vive
Yup. Standalone headsets are already sold out. Gotta get headset plus knuckles if you need to buy now,Vive
Mine arrived last night (I didn't even know about this when I ordered them :D),Vive
Yeah it's gotta be Rhys.,Vive
"Blue Shift and Opposing Force are side stories but they're pretty fun.  If you enjoy HL1 they're more of the same.

Since you didn't mention it, note that there is a Half-life 2 in between HL1 and HL2: Episode 1.",Vive
"It's not about early adoption. Index is a little more expensive, but better in every aspect. Rift S is significantly cheaper... and still better in some (many?) ways. Cosmos seems like a failed product, not an early adopter.",Vive

So are these controllers required for it I assume?",Vive
"""Variety of locomotion options"" I would interpret that as you can pick your poison.",Vive
https://half-life.com/en/alyx/vr has an explicit list.,Vive
Thank you!,Vive
Well yeah but you get the game for free if you buy the knuckles. So a $60 off coupon on the knuckles is something to take into consideration.,Vive
Loving it!,Vive
Xen is still not released. Play the original.,Vive
"Nooooo. Please just play the original.... They are similar, but decidedly different games.",Vive
So I can just buy the controllers and use them with my OG Vive and get the game??,Vive
Same here! I ordered mine Monday morning before they announced their announcement for today!,Vive

"i dont think they can. in the long-term, more and more I'm thinking all of this is headed towards standalone headsets w/ cloud computing over 5g, with only enough horsepower locally to run a version of ASW/motion smoothing/etc and to decode the stream, maybe do controller tracking etc. In fact, I'd almost say that is a requirement for mass adoption. 

These setups I think are essentially a dead-end long-term, but we're early adopters....it's the price we pay!",Vive
"Yeah, I bought an index headset recently and continued to use the Vive controllers but I think I'll have to pony up for them now. The only thing left of my original Vive will be the lighthouses.",Vive

Easily. I’m sick of playing final soccer vr with the same old non-challenging levels all the time. Also, graphics on par with headmaster vr would be excellent too

Anyway I can stay updated on your process of the game? Patreon? Discord? Twitter?",Vive
"Being able to play pes in vr, watching the game from the stands, would be sickkkk",Vive
"What would be really nice is a trailer released on steam as a VR demo, where we can see the same things we saw in the video but in VR.",Vive
Yeah I wouldn’t know any company that would do that... Certainly not a certain subsidiary of Facebook...,Vive
Xen is sort of out. It’s missing only the last few levels,Vive
"As someone who switched from vive wands to the knuckles, they are totally worth it. They basically float on your hands and are much more immersive. The finger tracking is okay but the real thing i like is just how ergonomic they are.",Vive
"15 hours and no multiplayer... Damned, my fears come true :s
I hope there is replayability..",Vive
Wait... is this... Half-life 3?,Vive
More like 1.5,Vive
"Hmm, still not available in Australia.

I notice the index was no longer available on Amazon (out of stock), so I'm thinking VALVE have sold all their initial production run units and are now ramping up an new batch of them. Maybe with increased production they'll open up availability to more countries.

I want to buy but not through a second or third party as that jacks up the price on what is already an expensive unit.",Vive
None if it is available in australia :/ I was looking to upgrade from my vive but whatever.,Vive
"Did you check today??? I'm in Canada, and it was the same, but everything just became available with the announcement. Check!!! If not, maybe soon??",Vive
"Ladies and Gentleman, I firmly believe the era of VR games is actually beginning to arrive.",Vive
Exactly the same here. I'm going to hold off until Black Friday just incase by some miracle the controller's are slightly discounted.,Vive
Its literally weeks away from being finished... The beta is already out.,Vive
"If this is a full immersive campaign the same way half life 2 was, then that’s all VR really needs right now.  

I’ve personally played through Half Life 2 a few times and there’s not much variation outside playing around with the “new physics tech”, in which case VR will be a natural improvement in every way",Vive
"Been looking at wireless from time to time but the price is insane for just an add on.
But today I found it for around 150€ where the normal price I can find in sweden is 370€. Last one apparently too, instant buy for me. Around 100€ price range I would have bought it sooner if it was around that price range but never saw it that low. But I bought it. will arrive next week consider its friday tomorrow. Also saw it was now sold out, so any other swedish person sorry.

I also know NOT to buy HTC battery because they are a massive scam for their price. Where you could find a battery double their size but half the cost.",Vive
"So far they've been able to come up with a superior headset.  Vive over rift,  and now  Index over Rift-S.  Fans of VR have been snapping up the Index as fast as they can, and in fact I'm still waiting to buy in my country.

Long term though I doubt Valve will be able to keep pulling the rabbit out of the hat.  Eventually the bigger hardware players will come up with a better headset at a better price and Valve will stop making them.",Vive
Nope. Black Mesa is a very faithful recreation.,Vive
Watched video. Grinning like an idiot now.,Vive
"Hopefully, im not sure. Saying that, I still dont think im going to purchase an index.",Vive
Of course it's missing arm swinging... But Natural Locomotion will likely support that anyway.,Vive
"VR's too small to have really good multiplayer, plenty of games die of quickly. I'd rather have a good, longer singleplayer experience instead!",Vive
"I don’t remember how long it took me to beat HL2, but probably less than 15 hours no?",Vive
Fears...? The original [half-life 2 was 15 hours](https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=4248) if you took your time. Generally actually 13.,Vive
"I do wish this was an interaction technique that was more widely used / supported.  It has been shown to reduce nausea since you are actively moving your body, which create proprioceptive (awareness of movement) feedback similar to as if you were actually walking through a space.",Vive
Wooo!  I see everything available and in CDN$ pricing.  And every bundle comes with the new Half Life VR game...,Vive
I feel like they're totally worth it anyway,Vive
"There are PC ports of both in development (by hobbyists), but who knows when they'll come out. An early HL1 build is available but it's too buggy to be worth playing at the moment IMO.

There's actually a good HL1 VR port on Oculus Quest already.",Vive
Wow this got lost in the commotion!,Vive
"finally, the first AAA VR game from an AAA company.

more need to follow.

the mod tools will open so much possibilities.",Vive
"Which, to be honest, I think is great. That is the key to making this mass-market, affordable, and introducing competition into the market. Really, these headsets shouldn't be different than any other monitor- they should be dirt-cheap (for what you get) with tons of competition and low barrier-to-entry for new players in the market.",Vive
"Yeah for sure! They do want to make money on SteamVR of course, but also I think they are just passionate for the tech.",Vive
"I have a feeling people will lose a lot more time in a VR HL game than on a 2D game.  The immersion factor and the compelling need to ""stop and smell the roses"" and explore will be so much higher in VR.  Moreso because Valve understands that that is exactly what's part of the DNA of a HL game.",Vive
"&gt; Community-built environments

is where we may find the replay and interest and potential for multiplayer mods.   counter strike started as a hl mod.  What is important is that the single player game is good enough to make the playerbase large to set things in motion.",Vive
Your “fears”? What “fears” are that? That Valve would deliver a groundbreaking single player experience that wasn’t over in a handful of minutes? Maybe the “fear” that they would provide new and up to date modding tools to allow the community to create additional content?,Vive
What about Switzerland ? :-(,Vive
Do you have a link so I can check it out?,Vive
Oh really? I wonder if it have revive support.,Vive
Fuck I have an oculus rift,Vive
"Vr will NEVER work with cloud computing, no amount of technological progress will make it possible. Motion - to - photon latency would go through the roof.",Vive
An excellent interview and a lot of cool info about why they went VR with this title and why they can't port it to flat screen format.  A must watch for Half-Life fans.,Vive
"tl;dr Visuals are much better. Tracking is horrible. 

&gt;  its not compatible with all my steam games

Which ones?",Vive
"I just wish for a high end headset with OLED screens and wide FoV, and ideally no edge distortion. Like the Pimax BE, but more polished.",Vive
"people are already doing it on quest, both locally via wifi streaming, and via services like Shadow (again, via wifi). If you haven't tested this yet for yourself, I understand the skepticism.

The experience is not quite there yet, but is a ""WOW, I CANT BELIEVE THIS"" none the same.",Vive
As long as you buy them this year.,Vive
Its a prequel that takes place before the events of half life 2 so no,Vive
Holy fuck it looks amazing,Vive
"Awesome! I'm gonna get them

*Looks at $300 price tag*

Uhhhhhhhhhhh",Vive
15 hrs? That'd be like me playing War Dust 3 times. I don't understand how people get so excited about single player games that don't have replayability. You practically either need to be able to set up unlimited different scenarios like a combat flight sim or need multiplayer to keep things unpredictable.,Vive
"You're taking crazy pills. Black Mesa is a good achievement, but to say it's ""better"" than the original is a subjective argument.",Vive
"&gt;stolen

Did you leave it in your car?",Vive
"And here I am.. Bought my OG Vive in the first wave.. Brought it with me everywhere.. Set it up on stages, other peoples homes, outside and at my place many many times.. Never had tracking problems. Never had setup problems. Never had hardware problems. Everything still going strong. Just some happy thoughts for you guys out there.",Vive
"No, Quest is their standalone Android-based device.",Vive
"VorpX allows you to play pancake games in VR and some of them work very well , and feel nearly like native VR.  These include Half Life 2, Portal and Bioshock.  I’m currently playing Half Life 2 this way and it is fantastic.  Well worth the cost of VorpX.",Vive
[deleted],Vive
"Hm, no need to enter a key? I wonder how that will work with the holiday season coming up, and people getting index for gifts...",Vive
"Seems unlikely. I had to spend like 2 months on a waiting list for them. With demand that high, they’d be more likely to raise the price before they even consider lowering it.",Vive
It's easily better for someone in a modern audience who has never played a half-life game before,Vive
Suuuuuuper smart of valve they gonna sell a lot of vives,Vive
That's what VR needs and it gonna mark the turning point for the whole industry into the direction of VR. No chance that I will go back to flat screen gaming. VR is amazingly brilliant and gonna sky rocketing from now on (2020 so to say).,Vive
Vr over wi-fi is one thing if computed locally but the cloud??? No way.,Vive
Took me 13 hours,Vive
"its all just latency. if 60ms over wifi is fine, then why cant 30 ms over a cable, or over WiGig work??

How does t work via cloud *right now* if it cant work at all? 

Remember back in 2016 when everyone said that wireless VR was years away, maybe impossible? Well Vive Wireless (even TpCast, though worse) blew that assumption out of the water with an indistinguishable experience. 

so really, you want to go all in on 'no way?'??? even 6-7 years out??????? 

Have you heard 5g is capable of sub-10ms latency?",Vive
Time to buy some Valve Index controllers!,Vive
Maybe you can still get it through the original purchaser?,Vive
Im not ditching my wireless vice but i want the knuckles for sure,Vive

I thought Oculus wasn't compatible with steam games? or am I wrong entirely.

If so, should I get a Cosmos or a quest?",Vive
"let me put it this way :)

oculus quest + oculus link = regular pcvr headset

oculus quest + alvr/virtual desktop = wireless pcvr headset

oculus quest alone is all-in-one vr android device compatible only with oculus quest apps",Vive
same train of thought here. 300 bucks for essentially a fancy gamepad ? No thanks. Payed 1000€ for the vive already,Vive
300€ -.-,Vive
Prisint.,Vive
"Ok, define ""better"".",Vive
Not necessary in terms of story though. Later games just ignore them.,Vive
More accessible in this case.,Vive
I have an og rift and I don't think I've found a single steam vr game I couldn't play,Vive
"I preordered the game before I read that valve made the index available in Canada today... 

Requested refund and ordered a index + knuckles , hope it doesn't mess up me receiving the game.",Vive

Yea. Bought my entire Rift CV1 with 3 sensors and 2 controllers for $200 so...,Vive
"No, I think gabe said half life 3 is likely to be a traditional PC game.",Vive
Countered by the physical exertion required,Vive
This is news to me haha,Vive
Especially now with HL announcement.,Vive

This is what I am excited about. Imagine prop hunt, getting pushed around on a shelf, sitting next to a can of beans.",Vive
Have they tweaked the physics in the Source version? I remember it making some of the jumping platform bits harder than it should have been.,Vive
"However, portal 1/2 are excellent games and should absolutely be on your game bucket list. Especially 2. 

And 2 player local co-op! It does require ‘a friend’ however.",Vive
Blue shift and opposing force are as others said side stories happening at the same time as the main game. You are playing a different character in those and they are fun. Basically they are what we would call a dlc nowadays.,Vive
Wait I have to get out of my chair?!,Vive
"I have an OG Vive and considered Comsos as well.. then i read some reviews. Two thinks basicall made go nah, i don't want it: First, Controllers have no rechargable batteries, requiring a stack of AA or AAA - whatever it was - lying around. OR invest in rechargable AA and charger, still an inconvenience. Second, tracking seems to be not as good as original Vive, and requires a decently lit room. Nah, my VR room is dark for a reason.

These things might not apply to you, but that's my take on it. I'll just wait for something .. else.",Vive
"I guess the question is, how much changes without the Index Controllers?",Vive
Exactly. Whether there will be HL1.5 Episodes 1 &amp; 2 (certainly not 3) is open for discussion.,Vive
"Rather than winner take all this reminds me of the Black Hat Vs White Hats tussles.

I suspect Valve has thus far done what it needs to do VR timing, hardware and software wise, to ensure its relevance in its core business activities, PC game sales, and likely will continue with such tactics as VR evolves. Valve still has the option to pivot, if it needs to.

Facebook has a slightly different VR objective and will continue to do whatever it can to achieve those goals, a genuine walled garden that can be stand alone, but will allow use with a PC. In my view the latter is indicative of the market challenge. While exclusives help Facebook it is yet to stifle the effect of the likes of HL in the PC gaming market, and may never do so, but time will tell.",Vive
Still not available Down Under :-(,Vive
Are the index controllers compatible with the original vive?  I really can't stant the vive controllers and would love to replace them...,Vive
"ah :/ thank you, this really helped.

any idea how well it shapes up against the oculus quest?",Vive
"Yep. They're kinda like the 1955 part of Back to the Future II, as in you get to see events from the original game from different perspectives.",Vive
There's another mod that adds Xen to it or so I've read recently.,Vive

[Vive Cosmos HMD with Valve Wand Controllers (v1.0)](/r/Vive/comments/dzs98y/vive_cosmos_hmd_with_valve_wand_controllers_v10/) by  dunks89


Pretty much what the title says - anyone come across a 3rd party solution to use the Cosmos with older hardware? The tracking on the new controllers is trash, and I'm not particularly excited to wait (and pay) for a $200 backwards-upgrade in 2020.

It doesn't sound like they have two more big VR games about ready to ship.,Vive
"The Cosmos is natively compatible with SteamVR, you need no additional accessories. The Quest needs an Oculus Link cable, but after that you have the combined libraries of Oculus PC, SteamVR, and Oculus Quest games. 

I've tried the Cosmos and can agree that tracking is really sub-par. If you're considering between the two get a Quest and an Oculus Link cable.",Vive
I think you mean indexs,Vive
"Sounds fantastic if you have a semi bigger play space area. Last time I tried to kick something I almost broke my foot and tracker, sad and good times",Vive
"Yes, they are compatible with the original Vive and the original Lighthouses, which is the setup I'm using.",Vive
Sweet! Unfortunately though I see they're 250 bucks for a pair =(,Vive
So just add stereoscopic 3D?,Vive
No he didn't.,Vive
Goddamnit!,Vive
"Not sure if you're being ironic, but apparently the game will support seated, standing or walking play.",Vive
"Yeah, pretty steep. I was sitting on a wad of Steambucks from the previous Xmas when they came out, or I'd probably still be wandbound.",Vive
"that's a factor, but more than that I usually just feel the need to take a break, and take the headset off. it's kind of weird being shut off from reality for too long.",Vive
"Finger and hand presence without having to grip a controller though, is so immersive and amazing. Just sell a kidney mate, you'll be right.",Vive
"I know what I'm going to get for xmas, even if I have to buy myself.",Vive
Time to sell my flight sim controllers for Knuckles.,Vive
No one ever mentions Voltron :/,Vive
I had to get a friend to buy my Index Controllers and ship them to me since I don't live in the states. Does this mean he gets the game? Bummer.,Vive
This is getting expensive. Buying an index plus a new PC. Leaving my old one for my wife.,Vive
Environmental storytelling is a huge part of Half-Life 2.,Vive
"I had VR for over a year now, but I still go back to 2D games. Both are great.",Vive
"No, you need a PCIe slot and even using a thunderbolt PCIe dock on a laptop won't work",Vive
Fortunately the game supports Seated play--according to the store page anyway.  I was a bit worried they'd only support standing but I'm happy to see this.,Vive
I think I've found a solution that doesn't require the slot: https://www.pbtech.co.nz/product/MVROEM0007/OEM-TPCAST-Vive-Wireless-Adapter-for-HTC-Vive-VR-H,Vive
And $60 lol,Vive
Heat is usually the biggest factor for me. Both my Vive and Index seem to have the sauna function enabled at all times.,Vive
"HL1 has an underpolished mod that is getting a new version sometime for VR that might be worth waiting for. IMHO play black mesa, the last few levels for it should come out in a month or so  


HL2 you used to be able to play in VR but not any more, it is a pity because it was the experience that totally sold me on VR. Still a great game pancake, but was amazing in VR",Vive
That was the big news I saw on the site that isn't captured by the trailer. This really is going to be like the next generation of the Tf2/HL/CS Source era.,Vive
It says people who buy it in 2019 will get bonus content. It doesn't say people who buy it later won't get the game for free.,Vive
"Ok so I’ve never owned a different VR platform, just tried the Vive briefly. I feel Index Controller finger tracking is all right (not that precise, but just to go grabby grabby in games that support it), but my favorite part is not having to hold them. Now I can’t imagine using VR controllers that I need to actually hold onto to instead of just strapping them on.",Vive
"It should be noted that the refresh rate on the Quest is still only 72 Hz though, which in my opinion is still a significant downside compared to other PCVR headsets.",Vive
Skyrim VR with Natural Locomotion is a pretty good workout. The world actually feels big again.,Vive
"So I've got an OG vive but I've been busy lately and haven't been keeping up with things. Can I just buy the new controllers when they become available? Or do I need the whole new set up? Like do the new controllers work with the OG sensors?  
  
Gunna suck getting stuff here in Aus it seems. Slow to become available in the first place then through the roof pricing.",Vive
dont forget it goes Half-Life 2 then Half-Life 2:Episode 1 THEN Half-Life 2: Episode 2. Just a little confusing i know.,Vive
Omg thank you for posting this. I think you just saved me 60 bucks.,Vive
You're the first person I've seen that's complained about a VR game being too *long*.,Vive

[Am I too slow for valve?](/r/Vive/comments/dzuaho/am_i_too_slow_for_valve/) by  zincer2


Quick little discussion thread here...   
I bought my vive a few months ago and love it, but now that we have the knuckles i want to know if its worth the get?  
Like I really want to get the knuckle controllers but I fear that my vive is gonna become outdated with how fast things are progressing... Do you think its worth investing in new controllers like that or will my vive go the way of the radio for something new in a year or two?

Oh fuck no: Whatever you do, *don't* buy that one.

The thingies you attach to the wall are called ""Lighthouses"". They increase the speed, accuracy, and reliability of your movement tracking.

Getting rid of those means your tracking is worse.

I recommend either getting a second-hand HTC Vive, or if you've got the money, a brand new Valve Index.",Vive
I read someone cleaned out all the individual little sensor holes (with rubbing alcohol i think) and it helped them.,Vive
You're a godsend. This has allowed me to confirm that one of my base stations in malfunctioning.,Vive
"Be prepared to go from “the touch pads on these things suck” to “the joysticks on these things suck” I made the upgrade from vive controllers to index controllers and don’t get me wrong, I think it’s worth it, but any game that requires you to push the joystick in so you can run will destroy your thumbs in 15 minutes.",Vive
"Sure thing, how did you figure that out? I get a lot of grey screens too.",Vive
"They are useless, should have been two more buttons",Vive
wow.. now I need one.,Vive
"O man O man O man, hope the game will last at least 50 hours :D",Vive
A fix eventually came out and I've seen multiple people confirm it now works,Vive
Me neither. The internetz,Vive
"Awesome thank you for this.
I doubt my CPU would be up to the job, but I'm looking in to possible upgrades VR kit wise.",Vive
Your RAM is fine. A used 4790K and matching mobo would be in your budget and within 20% or so of the latest processors on a per-core basis.,Vive
I recently built a computer with a 3800x and a x570-f motherboard and it works fine.,Vive
I'm still using an fx9370 and it's been great but doubt it will handle the wireless vive's needs.,Vive
"Yeah, probably not. Before I moved to my 3800x I was using a i5 4690k and the wireless adapter would peg it at 100% usage. The wireless adapter is great, but it's cpu hungry.",Vive
I've actually been really surprised how well the fx9370 handles VR with rift cv1. But I take it the wireless adapter reroute your graphics back through the motherboard instead of out the GPU?,Vive
"But Vader Immortal was always touted as an episodic “experience”. If Oculus had called it its Flagship Title that would have been more in line with what I’m saying. But they didn’t, because that would be really hurtful to their brand and their goals in VR to do so. That’s all I mean.",Vive
It's right on top of it. I should move it then...,Vive
"Well it makes your CPU compress the video stream on the fly so essentially, yes",Vive
"I can wear gloves, My main issue is that tube of rubber inside the joystick degrades like butter. Idk what they did differently than the steam controller but its so fucking unusable. However I got a question, what exactly does it do. I have an rc car with a controller that hurts like shit to use at all because Its spiked at the top of the stick, is that what you mean?",Vive
"I mean whenever you have the joystick pushed forward and you need to click it down like a button, it requires you to stretch your thumb out quite a bit and it kinda requires you to make a claw that quickly cramps up your hand. Now I may just have short thumbs but personally it gets pretty uncomfortable pretty fast, fortunately though most games have an alternative run button or at the very least you can always rebind it.",Vive
"I feel like this is a simple question, but....You have the Vive Pro EYE and not just the Vive Pro, correct?

Otherwise there's probably a defect and you should swap it.",Vive
that sucks. Still will probably get it.,Vive
"Yeah I would still recommend it though, it’s a personal gripe that doesn’t come up for me too often. The index controllers are definitely better than the OG vive controllers",Vive
" So it's ok for Oculus to bribe devs and hardware lock their store but not Epic to bribe devs and not hardware lock.

Sure.",Vive
"To others, Half Life Alyx will represent the turning point they were waiting for.

For us, it's just another brick in the great road of VR. :&gt;",Vive
"While I love like 90% of those games, I think it's safe to say they're not ""killer apps"" (for the most part, no disrespect intended to the amazing devs!) I feel like the closest VR has to a killer app up until this point would be something like Beat Saber and Superhot VR (these are the games people who don't have VR are most familiar with, so they're certainly the most visible).


In the same way someone wouldn't buy a Switch for Untitled Goose Game, I don't think people would buy VR for say, Duck Season. But, when you have titles like BOTW and Super Mario Odyssey, it becomes easier to sell the hardware. All of the games on the scale of something like Half Life: Alyx are Oculus exclusives right now, and most are smaller in scale. Half Life: Alyx is definitely a step in the right direction, and hopefully we can continue to get some killer games from Valve to help push other AAA publishers to take VR more seriously.",Vive
"Uhhh... no pretty sure besides Bear Saber, Half-Life: Alyx will be the killer app.",Vive
that one is not bad for people who don't know what the're doing.  At least you can upgrade it once you get more experienced.,Vive
"For people like me who spend 90% of their time in multiplayer games, you're right- this is far from the first killer app. Pavlov and Echo Arena / Combat have all but *replaced* desktop shooters and Rocket League for me (still play with my buddies sometimes, but if I'm alone it's no contest.)

That said, plenty of people *never* play multiplayer games at all and they want something more than a sandbox, a 5 hour story, or a collection of smaller experiences.

Half Life: Alyx is the first mainstream, franchised game that will appeal to those people. 

I also believe that because of this, we're going to be seeing an absolute avalanche of new titles from major developers (and more ambitious indie projects) announced in the next year or two. This is a great time for VR players!",Vive
Contrarian much?.....nah brah you’re right. How’s Water Bears these days.........................,Vive
Ooooh....it’s true; that was a dumb fucking question.,Vive
Woah the dumb-ass questions are full force today...,Vive
"I think the main issue is people have either never tried **good VR** or have only tried it for 20 minutes or less.  They didn't try out all these games to see which ones clicked with them.  They just haven't given **VR enough of a chance** because it takes effort.  

But then you slap Half-Life on a new VR game and now their interest is peaked. Maybe they'll give VR another shot.  It's like Inception is a better movie then then Star Wars 8 but Inception didn't draw as big of a crowd.  It's name recognition.",Vive
"Try Facebook marketplace, seen one guy selling vive for $500cad.",Vive
That's pretty neat :),Vive
I don't know why it's on r/Vive though,Vive
have you tried turning off antivirus protection/defender/firewall?  it might help : ),Vive
Mine was grey-screening when my video card was over 82°c. With a new video card it went away :/,Vive
"Lol... I figured that game would catch some flack. If you haven't tried it, I recommend giving it a shot. I picked it up for the kiddos, but surprisingly enjoyed it myself.",Vive
I believe in a killer app when I see it.,Vive
"Agreed. I always throw people into the quick and easy games; theBlu, SuperHot, Beat Saber, Richie's Plank, etc. I really wish that it was as easy to put them into some of the more complex or longer games, but it's either time constraints or complex controls that prevent that. Hopefully HL will get more adopters, but I think people expected a widespread adoption with Skyrim and Fallout. Regardless of what happens, we'll be playing Half-Life and Boneworks soon enough.",Vive
"Couldn't agree more. I think people who have been on the fence will take the plunge for Half-Life. 

Also, good call on those additions. I hope the newcomers look into the catalog of games that they missed up to this point (and simultaneously avoid all of the trash and cash grabs).",Vive
"it is 3D yes, but don't buy the cosmos, it's shit, and it's htc on top of that",Vive
Agreed:) been plenty killer apps for me. But half life maybe the killer apps bringing VR to mainstream,Vive
"Just listing all the games you have doesn't make them 'Killer Apps'. And you're really stretching the point with a lot of those, I mean 'Waters Bears' come on now.",Vive
"Yes, it's fully 3d. As an example, I've had a friend throw the vive controller to me and I've caught it in mid-air. You can throw virtual balls at targets. You can lob things and easily estimate car braking distances. You can estimate distances pretty well, up to many tens of meters just like in real life. Many games will render stuff more than 100-200m in mono for performance. Yes, it looks very much 3d.  

The original vive is the best for fitting glasses. The rift is a bit smaller, I don't know about cosmos or index.",Vive
Many games you listed don't even have controler support or official vr version..,Vive
"like honestly your budget isn't really where it needs to be for a VR system.   I see your reasoning below and I guess I get it, but what youre talking about isn't really meant for the world of PC VR. 

Go get an oculus quest, you are exactly the target market for that device.",Vive
"Don't jump to cobclusions or try to bait. Exclusivity is never good, but Epic does it so much more often and affects a lot more people due to the lack of HMDs required. A headset is like a console, so exclusivity makes more sense. It still sucks, sure, but it's more understandable.",Vive
"While most of those games are great, they aren't what I'd call a killer app. Sure, you'd spend a long time in them, but they either aren't very big or high-budget, or they're just VR versions/ports of existing games. HLVR is different.",Vive
"There are no dumb questions, only dumb answers.",Vive
Whatever is Viveport anyway?,Vive
Not everyone knows literally every little-itty-bitty thing about VR. Don't berate people for trying to fix the gaps in their knowledge.,Vive
Google Earth VR...,Vive
"You list a lot of experiences, a couple hastily thrown together ports and lots of junk, but forget to list the only really good VR game? Beat Saber is the only game that is good for more than 15 minutes of curiosity.",Vive
Does the Vive Pro base stations (2.0) have a link cable? The Valve Index base stations (2.0) don't come with a cable and couldn't use one if they wanted to.,Vive
Howbout we play it first and work on that pedistal later.,Vive
"Oh, sorry I missed getting back. Based on my resource graphs while playing, I don't believe it's a cpu bottleneck. Don't get me wrong, it will still play anything. But you'll notice that the minimum recommend for a lot of more intensive VR titles is the 1070. And that seems correct to me.",Vive
"&gt;  A headset is like a console,

A headset is like a monitor, not a console.

It's on PC, and out of the major VR vendors only Facebook owned Oculus don't support the entire market yet a single dude in his spare time was able to knock up support.",Vive
If you think all of those apps are killer apps you have lost. This is just stupid.,Vive
"You're forgetting that not one of the games you mention has got a well known franchise in the PC gaming stretching back over decades.

Half Life has been a fan favourite for many, many years and is a well known name in games.",Vive
im gonna save this post for later.,Vive
"It's like Netflix for VR games, but with a vast amount of ""meh"" games/experiences to pad it out.

If you get a free trial it's damn good for checking out expensive VR titles without having to blow £30+ just to see if you like it",Vive
I don’t think you know what Killer App means.,Vive
It's a console in the way that you can't play VR games without it. Entry-level HMDs are also of a similar price range.,Vive
Ditto. I think well known franchise will bring more vr users from casual ranks. Maybe even some who were turned off by Google cardboard.,Vive
"I bought my Vive pre-owned, so the code that came with it was used. Eh, I don't think I missed much.",Vive
"I really think youre missing the point and have gone off on some weird tangent regarding consoles.

Oculus is Epic of the VR world, except due to the additional hardware lock, it's much worse than Epic can ever be unless they also add a hardware lock to their store.

In case you still don't get it. 

Oculus bribe devs to only release on their store which effectively blocks WMR, HTC &amp; Valve users from playing it... at all

Epic bribes devs to only release on their store which only creates the minor inconvenience of yet another store to install. 

Which is worse? Not being able to access the game at all, or installing a store and playing immediately?",Vive
"well 1070 is more or less 1660, so i should be fine hopefully, unless cpu bottlenecks in which case id be super disappointed",Vive
"I think, unless steam starts bankrolling be games the way Facebook has, we probably won't. If those two got into a competitive bid for game devs to make be games, we'd probably see a number of really kick ass games getting made, which would bolster the market, which would give more incentive to make games for it which bolsters the market which gives more....",Vive
Pardon my ignorance. What is a killer app?,Vive
"You do know what ReVive is, right? I can still play Rift games thru my Vive. The exclusivities, while a bummer, are a lot more understandable in the VR market, where the demographic is still rather small. Epic on the other hand is doing nothing but strangling consumer choice, stealing games that were already meant to release on Steam. Not only that, they're not just indies. There are massive, multi-million, AAA games that Epic is bribing, despite the companies developing and publishing them having absolutely zero financial need for the bribe.",Vive
"Man, people are really getting their hopes up with Half-Life: Alyx...

Valve has been coasting on its reputation for a very long time. Let's see if they still have the magic before we get too excited.",Vive
"&gt; having absolutely zero financial need for the bribe.

Ever heard of investors?",Vive
"S... s.. Serious Sam? :(  
Elite?",Vive
"the zero financial need is taken from a realistic standpoint. Of course, the companies will justify it with the investor excuse and the expectation that infinite return of investment is a thing, but that's not how the world goes. The money will not be used to support the developers. It'll either just be thrown onto the massive pile of money in the company's coffers or the CEO's pockets. With smaller games, the money Epic provides would actually be of some use, giving them financial support to be able to continue making games. That isn't a requirement for AAA companies, who are just fine without it.",Vive
"Both ports of an existing pancake game, **not** a pure VR only game",Vive
"Elite, yeah. But Serious Sam: The Last Hope is a VR exclusive. Just because a title is a port doesn't mean its not 'full AAA title' available in VR. The FO4 VR port was shit in my experience, but the Serious Sam Encounters are far better in VR.",Vive
yes the wireless adaptor,Vive
"&gt; the zero financial need is taken from a realistic standpoint. Of course, the companies will justify it with the investor excuse and the expectation that infinite return of investment is a thing, but that's not how the world goes.

It *is* how the world goes. Companies (successful ones, anyway) are devices that at their core produce money. If there's an option that provides a bunch of money with little downside then of course they'll take it.

And it's certainly not like there's anything illegal about these exclusivity deals, either - they don't need excuses for that reason.

Like it or hate it, but publicly traded companies don't need excuses to make money.

&gt; The money will not be used to support the developers. It'll either just be thrown onto the massive pile of money in the company's coffers or the CEO's pockets.

Investors usually aren't too happy about that, either - they'd much rather have it paid out in dividends.

&gt; That isn't a requirement for AAA companies, who are just fine without it.

EA and Ubisoft could throw cash out their windows and still be just fine. Again, their goal is to make money, and turning down opportunities to cut out a needless 10-20% fee is very appealing.",Vive
"&gt; I have no idea what Alyx will be, but I hope that ...

That's why I wrote what I wrote. Emphasis on ""hope"".",Vive
"Bullshit: You haven't even played it yet.

Based on its pedigree, I think it has a shot at being SteamVR's first killer app: And with VR sales stagnating, we need to finally get a killer app if we want VR to reach mainstream appeal any time soon.",Vive
"You misunderstood. By ""not how the world goes"", I meant that an infinite return on investment is completely impossible. At some point, there *will* be a cap on just how much money one is able to squeeze, and companies simply refuse to accept that.",Vive
"&gt; But Serious Sam: The Last Hope is a VR exclusive.

Fair point, I'd forgotten that one. Though I suspect more gamers / non gamers know about HL than Serious Sam.",Vive
Oh no doubt. But there are long standing franchises with AAA titles playable in VR.,Vive
"i fear than you dont know the real meaning of the word ""killer app"",and the funny thing is than the games than are more near to be defined as killer app, namely Beat Saber and Asgard's Wrath, are not present in your long list",Vive

Grand Theft Auto VR mods,Vive
"First... Some of the games on your list are just too short, too linear or poorly made (Plank experience is all of those) to be ""Killer Apps"". Even some ports are in the list. Not that I don't enjoy a bit of a heist with some friends, but you clearly feel this ""It's not made with vr in mind""-feeling.

Second... You are not wrong with the title of your post. Boneworks will release before hl:a :›",Vive
I grabbed this to help my parents adjust to left side driving before their trip to New Zealand. The performance in VR was sub 60fps at low settings for a i-7 8750 and RTX2070,Vive
You just named every game slightly worth playing. A small fraction of those would be considered a killer app at best,Vive
"&gt;  stealing games that were already meant to release on Steam

Oculus have done this at least 3 times we know of. That. We. Know. Of.

&gt;despite the companies developing and publishing them having absolutely zero financial need for the bribe.

Epic themselves took money to release Robo Recall.

Then you have the latest exclusives funded by Oculus which are all bigger teams and the indies are now told they're not getting funds.",Vive
"ETS2 has a car in it since 2 years ago, so that kinda works.",Vive
"I mean it depends how loud you have them and whether you actually use them for VR. If you only ever use the speakers when the base stations are off, then it's less of an issue. I had to move mine away from my fridge because it shuddered when it turned on / off and screwed up my tracking for a second. Personally, I would move it.",Vive
ATS with car mods.,Vive
Arent these games funded by Oculus? Meaning the games wouldnt exist if they didnt get the backing?,Vive
"It wasn't overheating(in general), it's to do with where the strap for the wireless attaches to the headset. It can rub on the top of the head and cause discomfort. I adjusted the strap slightly after having this issue and I've had no problems since.

The wireless adapter does get hot but it's not hot enough to burn you or overheat (at least in general, a small minority may have had overheating issues).",Vive

"I haven't heard of any design changes. 

Mine would get pretty hot. I put a tiny fan on it to keep it cool, but the unit still cuts out occasionally for no apparent reason (maybe once per hour). I used to get black screens and grey screens, but now I just get the grey screens and that doesn't usually require a restart. I think the grey screen is caused by interference not heat.",Vive
"Ah you mentioned Vector 36! Such an amazing racing games. ""Realistic"" atmospheric pod racing on mars. Still in Love.",Vive
So this has less performance than Euro Truck Simulator?,Vive
Does it has decent performance in VR? Is the car interior fully rendered and detailed?,Vive
"Elite Dangerous has been my Killer VR app for almost 4 years. Everytime I play it, my desk vanishes, the room goes away, the world is gone, it's me, sitting in my ship in deep space, looking for pirates, transporting cargo, exploring an interesting looking moon. The ambiance just completely captures and immerses me.",Vive
10th!,Vive
What I was saying was weird was that they haven't had a Twitter account until now.,Vive
"Like many here, I was front line for pre ordering a Vive. We had a slow start but things just got better and better and now I'm onto an Index. I didn't buy VR for a then theoretical HL game anymore than I bought my first PC for a then theoretical Half Life game. I bought in for what was already available.  

I don't believe the term ""killer app"" really applies here. VR is what it is. A tool to be used however the end user see's fit. Be it practical or entertainment application, it has something to offer anyone who takes the time to learn about it and explore what is on offer. The possibilities are endless. 

That all said, people are people and right now, gaming is where VR is most prominent. Half life really popularised PC gaming back in the 90's to the point it was seen ""as good as if not better than"" console gaming at that time. At a time when Nintendo, Sega and Sony reigned supreme (well...Nintendo and Sony at least), it was very refreshing to see console gamer's suddenly want to buy their first PC but Valve didn't do it totally on their own. Other games where there as well and hopefully this is history repeating itself. 

There's no doubt about it, HL:A has generated a lot of buzz and at first glance, it would appear to be the game that gets a lot of gamers prepared to buy into VR. It might not be ""the"" killer app to us (for good reason) but it might well be the game that sells a couple more million headsets. 

Time will tell but VR is very much being paid attention to now so lets see where this goes.",Vive
:O,Vive
i dont have any antiviruses except for i guess windows defender i guess but it's de-activated and i'm pretty sure it doesn't effect anything except for some installations (but defender always asks me if its a virus but in this case it didnt ask me anything),Vive

"It's native supported, so it should be fully rendered. But I can't check for myself rn.",Vive

"You would get a worse headset and slightly better controllers, I don't see this as an upgrade to be honest.",Vive
"If that is the case, then it's very much understandable why they're exclusive. While the exclusivity is a bummer, I'm still happy that large VR games in general are being made.",Vive
At this point seriously consider the top end 3000 series Ryzens. Almost identical game performance but they absolutely destroy the 9900k in everything else. The wireless should also benefit from the extra cores.,Vive

You just end up making so many friends, and have such a great time, that you can't help but want to be fully immersed.

You can put just one base station in A mode and start up Home. It will prevent one from compensating for the other, and let you assess whether it's tracking properly. If your headset works well with one lighthouse and not the other, then you've got solid evidence. 

Also, a quick LPT to make sure your lighthouses are aligned: put your camera in selfie mode and make sure the opposite lighthouse is center of frame just at/off the top of the frame. It makes a significant difference in reliability.

"It looks to me like it relies on the relative motion between the controller (static in your hand) and the finger pads to recreate the sensation of an object grasped between your thumb and index finger moving. Like if you held a virtual draw handle and closed the draw to the end of its movement, but kept pushing, you would feel your fingers being pressed into your hand as you moved your hand forward, as if the thing you were grasping could move no further. I hope that made sense, it's difficult to explain! I'm not sure why they are waving their hand around, maybe just to demonstrate which direction they feel the force in?",Vive

"&gt; By ""not how the world goes"", I meant that an infinite return on investment is completely impossible. At some point, there *will* be a cap on just how much money one is able to squeeze, and companies simply refuse to accept that.

While an infinite amount is impossible, their job is to make that ROI as high as possible.

&gt; That would be reasonable if they simply released their games on both Steam and Epic, but no.

Then most people would probably buy it on Steam, and they would loose out on that extra money.

&gt; They refuse to use Epic unless Epic bribes them.

There are loads of games on both Epic and Steam if that's what you meant - Cyberpunk 2077 comes to mind, along with Klei's lineup.

Epic is well known for paying for exclusivity. There have been a bunch of cases where devs who declined Epic's offering have stated how much they would've given.,Vive
"Sure. The methods I've seen to align the base stations seem to rely on using the room layout screen, which doesn't help if you have a bad station. Since the base station is a cube, you can just hold the back of your phone to the front of it and your camera will be pointing in the same direction as the base station. If you put it in selfie mode, you basically have a screen showing you what its line of sight is.

If the other base station is directly in the middle of your picture, then the camera (and also the station you're adjusting) are both pointing directly at it. Since you want the base station to point down a little bit, you can just tilt it down until the other base station is right at the top of the frame.",Vive
The only thing I know about this game is it's a reason to pretend you know something to attract views.,Vive
Yesssss!!! I'm waiting for this one!! keep it up!,Vive
"&gt;Killer App

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer\_application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application) 

&gt; In marketing terminology, a **killer application** (commonly shortened to **killer app**) is any [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that is so necessary or desirable that it proves the core value of some larger technology, such as [computer hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware), a [gaming console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console), [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software), a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), a [software platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_platform), or an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application#cite_note-1) In other words, consumers would buy the (usually expensive) hardware just to run that application. A killer app can substantially increase sales of the platform on which it runs. 

I appears that *HL: Alyx* may well be the killer app for the Knuckles controller and may also boost sales significantly for the Valve Index and potentially for other HMDs.  Valve is a mega-corporation and there is a huge base of *HL* fans.",Vive
"I see, thanks!",Vive
"That's an excellent question ! Try plug in a usb drive. If it work, then a mic will likely work",Vive
"For a moment I thought Sixense were making this, as in the Sixense STEM. 

Looking good!",Vive
"Eh, this is essentially just a Gear VR with a foregrip. You can't really show the capabilities of VR without the controllers and a little bit of explaining.",Vive
"AFAIK don't use Vive's official wireles adapter. Like with everything official Vive-related, it's overpriced. There's third-party hardware that's cheaper and works fine.",Vive
"The whole concept of a ""killer app"" is stupid.",Vive
This looks cool! I love the super dark with bright neon look!,Vive
Totally [the future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscope).,Vive
Better be good,Vive
"&gt; it's still a third person controlled game (I forget the name, but there was one anime-style beat em up I enjoyed you played with the controller, and you ""watched"" the character do their thing on what looked like a floating platform in front of you).

Sounds like the premise of [Holoception](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1064160/Holoception/). You control a tiny stick figure that mirrors your movements. You can adjust the scale of the game in real time. A word of warning though: It is in early access and there are a few bugs they seem to be ironing out still.

There's also the Oculus exclusive Brass Tactics, which is a similar style to Final Assault.

Personally I think there is a huge potential for additional RTS and City Building type games in VR. I'm surprised there aren't more of them.",Vive

I have VROptician happy with them........ I occasionally hear some bad things about widmo lenses.... appears to be some issues w/ their higher index options. but alot of people ar ehappy with them...... I think both are good options tbh.,Vive
It will work just fine. I have used a wired corsair void headset since day 1 with vive.,Vive
"I purchased a pair of cheap frames and lenses from the pediatric department at Walmart that fit easily inside the Rift CV-1 (which is even less glasses-friendly than the Vive).  I brought my HMD with me when I tried them on to make sure they fit.

I am pretty nearsighted and I was delighted to discover that I don't need any glasses, however, with my Vive Pro.  Evidently the focal distance is closer than with the Rift.

I also experimented with a DIY solution taking apart a pair of old glasses and wedging the frame into the Rift that worked very well.

"the vive pro has no eye tracking, you gotta get the pro eye",Vive
"Of course you’d prefer those specs as would anyone however the majority of people can’t afford to spend $1000 on a headset hence why the Rift is probably the best option for the majority of people.

Also, the refresh rate downgrade was to make sure the Rift S kept the same requirements as the CV1, I’ve used both and couldn’t notice the difference 🤷‍♀️",Vive
Being new it still has some roughness to it but overall I can see great potential.  One of the best I've seen.,Vive
Helll yes,Vive
Why top of the frame? One thing that I found useful was a steamvr workshop file that added FOV displays to the lighthouses in VR so you could see exactly where the lighthouse could reach.,Vive
"I don't wear glasses, but doesn't using them significantly lower your FOV because you have to put the lenses farther from your eyes? Contacts and eyedrops might be a decent option.

Obviously, try and find a solution that's best for you, but VR is noticeably worse for me if I use a headset right after someone with glasses because the lenses are so far from my eyes.",Vive
"I've had the wireless adapter since release on my OG Vive and while I can attest that it can get hot to the touch, I do not notice the heat on my head whatsoever (deluxe audio strap probably helps there). I've had a six hour straight game session one night and I never experienced any sort of overheating that leads to a crash or grey screens or anything like that.

To be honest, Half-Life is going to boost sales, but I don't think we're going to see anything near what people are expecting. The future of mass VR adoption is most likely going to come in the form of something watered down and untethered, like the Oculus Quest. It's simple, affordable, no gaming rig required, and it's still really good for what it is. I'd love to see everyone get into VR, and I've converted a fair share of my friends. However, I'm going to keep my expectations at a realistic level.",Vive
"I've played everyone of those games in VR, supported by the dev. Can you point out one game I mentioned that doesn't have an official VR version?",Vive
I'd probably go for it myself if it wasn't for the fixed IPD. I'm on the larger side of the spectrum and I've found software ipd is *okay* but it always seems to irk me that it's not quite right. It's a shame that ipd adjustment seems to be on the higher end of the next wave of hmds,Vive

And between this (and whatever Valve is cooking up) I'm truly excited for what comes next.",Vive
"It really is. I think that's one of those gems that a lot of people overlooked. It's a bit rough when you first try it, but once you get used to it, it's amazing.",Vive
Absolutely! I'm extremely hyped for both.,Vive
"I've managed to convert quite a few people to VR with some of those apps (probably the ones you have in mind). I think the biggest hurdle for getting people to go out and buy into VR is just getting them to try it.

I thought I had included Beat Saber. That's a huge oversight on my part. I haven't tried Asgard's Wrath. I'll have to check it out.,Vive
"Yeah. It reminds me of when people were getting their hopes up for Skyrim and Fallout. Too much hype. The reality is, Half-Life will come and go. We'll be talking about Boneworks next month, and the following month will be people complaining that there's no killer app for VR. Hopefully I'm wrong, but we've seen hype over killer apps in the past.",Vive
Stop hatin'.  I played some of those games you mentioned...they're not killer apps.  Job Simulator?  GTFO here.  Tilt Brush? What's so killer about that?  Just drawing.,Vive
"Beat Saber definitely qualifies IMO.  It's the first VR game where I regularly have people who are not into VR or even gaming in general asking to play it or asking what the best setup to play it on would be.  It's on the verge of being a ""mainstream"" title.",Vive

"Can be harder to set up, green line, little to no official support form the company, having to flash the firmware for it to work right. Picture quality/latency is supposed to not be as good. It really is more of a hack together solution for enthusiast then a finished product. If you use it and enjoy it that's great, I wouldn't personally recommend it to people though.",Vive
"Ok but what is it about?  
And how are they controlling motion?

Also, the movement of the opponents looks pretty slow and unimpressive from an AI standpoint. Everything in this trailer is pretty static and motionless. Pretty, but meh.",Vive
"You don't know the definition of a killer app my friend.  Think Nintendo 64 when it released Mario 64 with it.  Every game you listed up there is good, but definitely not killer apps.  Not one of them.  Closest we've gotten so far imo is Stormland and Asgard's Wrath and even they are barely on the edge.",Vive
"Honestly that’s a fantastic option as well! Plus the Quest has a slightly better display however it runs at a slightly lower 72hz but most people probably won’t notice the difference, I couldn’t notice the 10hz difference between the original Rift and the S but that’s each to their own. But yeah, if you take anything away from this it should be that VR isn’t unaffordable and you don’t need to spend $1000 like Valve want you to",Vive
My OG rift comes off the shelf again. Come on Valve dont mess up this story and world I loved so much.,Vive
"Yup. 

The Index is gorgeous, no doubt. I only used it for 4-5 hours but I was blown away by how good it looked.

As It can't be before Half Life because Alyx wasn't born yet. I don't know how you could make it after HL EP2 just with how EP2 ended you really just need to start where it left off. Why not call it HL3 at that point? 

I guess they could make it in the exact same time as Half Life 2 as Alyx wasn't with Gordan all of the time. But I hope not.",Vive
"Probably not, but it'd be a nice add-on.",Vive

That means the Vive Pro needs your GPU to push 8% more pixels than 4K. Of course VR-only games are usually made to run on current hardware with current headsets in mind so they're usually less demanding than regular PC games at the same resolution. Red Dead 2 on the other hand seems to be tuned for future hardware at its max settings so it's not a great comparison,Vive
"I went from Vive wireless and thought the same thing as you, and then I got an Index and haven’t used my Vive again since. Just my experience... Massive upgrade.",Vive
"I don't see them releasing a game that requires index, probably like boneworks where its nice and lets you do some neat things like sliding hands on objects without letting go etc. but the idea of valve releasing a game where you really need a controller that isn't even sold globally, let alone to some really big countries is absurd, hell I don't think you can even buy it in america/europe right now because of stock. I don't think they could feasibly release a game tied to that hardware when they can't even supply it to a decent amount of people.",Vive
"The Index controllers offer better immersion, but no new gameplay features.

"Guaranteed.

Here’s my take, only an opinion.
Valve planned to widen the release much quicker but due to the high volume of RMAs (especially controllers) they held off. The manuals have Quebec and Canadian- specific disclaimers and approvals. I have an Index in Canada. ❤️ it’s awesome.",Vive

No disagreement here. It's way too front-heavy as-is. I couldn't even play it for longer than 30 minutes before getting face pain.

But, the $2 counterweigh mod I got fixed that entirely. Now I can play it for hours without any discomfort. 

The Index was very, very comfortable! ...But dealing with a wire was just too much for me. I kept thinking I'd get used to it, and I just kept...not getting used to it.

"“Our flagship VR game” 
- Valve tweet

“Right now we're building three VR games,"" Valve founder Gabe Newell confirmed to Eurogamer during a media roundtable at the studio's Bellevue, Washington office. ""When I say we're building three games, we're building three full games, not experiments,"".
-https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-02-10-valve-is-making-three-fully-fledged-vr-games

It doesn’t take a genius to put these two together and come to the conclusion that this is one those 3 titles.

And since they say “our flagship VR game”, it’s unlikely there will be another Half Life title among those other two.

Personally I’m picking Team Fortress 3, and maaaybe left 4 dead. But they did say that they tried some things that didn’t work in VR.",Vive

"This somehow doesn't flash to the USB's, they just act like normal. Is there something I'm missing? Is there a full tutorial somewhere?",Vive
It's speculation that the playthrough will take 16 hours. From a previous interview we also know that the ability to replay the game was an important part.,Vive
I am guessing a prequel.,Vive
could be a prequel.,Vive
Half Life 2.75 confirmed,Vive
The Ultimate Flame Wars are coming.,Vive
I’m sure after 3 years of work and an unlimited budget they’ll totally have no content.,Vive
"if you like, drop a quick tweet/link about your experience to @VRfounders … they're collecting stories from VR content creators to raise the awareness how small the market still is, and how hard (and costly) it is to make something for VR. The idea is that these stories will rally VR enthusiasts to do a bit more on their end – if every HMD owner would take 10-15 minutes a day to actively like/share/comment VR content, we could make the dream real in no time :D",Vive
"Which is fine, maybe you only like Zelda",Vive
"You can play them all with revive, I’ve done that for 3 years",Vive
"I don’t think it’ll *require* Index controllers, but you can bet it’ll be designed with them principally in mind",Vive
"Hmmmm.... well you’re about to get your own game, even if it’s universal",Vive
"I remember playing BL2VR on ReVive, and it was super janky. Granted, the entire game was jank, but ReVive didn't make matters easier.",Vive
"i really don't think they can lower cost much at all. what a *lot* of people don't understand is how extremely labour intensive making the knuckles is, as well as the index, and how amazingly precise each base station must be and how exacting its individual calibration. 



the index and knuckles are made in china, although the light-to-digital chips were designed in the usa and fabricated in either europe or at tsmc (i haven't chased that supply chain past designer triad semiconductor).  each knuckle (dv version, because it was handy) has 21 of them with attached to photodiodes connected to a pcb via a pfc^(*) unique to each sensor. as these sensors are placed on the front above the trigger, on the bottom by the strap tensioner, on th control surface, and all over the arch knuckle guard (14 there alone), they must be assembled and connected by hand. we haven't even got to the capacitive sensors all over this thing that *also* need to be hand assembled. oh, assembly is a major cost of *simple* devices, and quite often upwards of 20% of the total per unit cost. for complicated hand assembly, we're looking at a lot more.



the hmd is likely also assembled by hand, although it is probably proportionally less expensive to assemble as it isn't ~~a shitshow of complicated curves~~ as critical to design the hmd to minimize volume and weight at the expense of manufacturing complexity.


considering the above, plus support costs, i can't imagine valve's margin on either the hmd or controllers is more than 10%, and i feel this is a significant over-estimation. i wouldn't be surprised if the margin was under 1%, or even slightly negative right now. please keep in mind that this doesn't include recuperation of development costs.



the base stations might be different, as i understand they are made in the usa. at one point, i was hearing rumor that each base station would be $60 in lots of 45 for oems selling them with hmds. i also heard that was valve's cost.



what we *do* know is that the motors are custom made for valve, the base stations are extremely precisely made and after calibration (6 parameters for v1... i think there's 5 for v2, but i'm not confident in that exact number) they're accurate and repeatable in their spindle rotation to a small number of *atoms*. i'm not sure what number this is for v2, but [v1's spindles were rotation accurate to under 2500 atoms](https://hackaday.com/2016/12/21/alan-yates-why-valves-lighthouse-cant-work/). we also know they're $150 each on steam in the usa, and the full kit is $150 less expensive than ordering à la carte.



accounting for the price difference in packaging material, shipping costs, and logistics, i'd estimate the difference is between $100 and $125.



that valve seems more willing to cross/advanced ship base station rmas tells me that failure rates of the complex precision mechanical laser platform were expected and priced accordingly. this leads me to believe the actual manufacturing cost of a base station is around $75, and they effectively give you the second one free if you purchase the full kit as a package deal, leaving $25-75 on the table as ”profit” after costs before r&amp;d recuperation by my slightly informed and experienced guesswork and estimation.




materials costs aren't going to come down unless volume increases astronomically, so the obvious places to look for cost reduction are reducing assembly time and complexity and/or reducing defect and failure rate and the associated expenses downstream (more reliable units means less spent in support and rma)



triad semiconductor, the company making custom light-to-digital chips for valve that each knuckle uses 21 of, also makes the sample hardware for valve's steamvr tracking hdk. as of now, triad has made 2 public versions of the hdk hardware, corresponding with v1 and v2 lighthouse technology, and triad has made 2 versions of their light-to-digital chip.


the v2 hdk hardware has been sold out at triad for months, as well as the v2 light-to-digital chips. 


triad has a new product listed on the website: the [ts8730 tiny single chip light to digital converter with ontegrated photodiode](https://www.triadsemi.com/product/ts8730/) with ”details coming soon...” as the description.


to me, this means that valve is likely taking a stab at simplifying manufacturing and assembly of the knuckles and hmd, as this would reduce part count and sub-assembly count substantially, and probably speed hand-assembly, thereby reducing a major expense. as the part count decreases, the reliability, specifically the defect rate should decrease, increasing margins a little bit.



the other possibility for triad's new part doesn't exclude our previous paragraph's speculation, but if this thing is what i think it is, we will probably be getting a redesigned and streamlined lower cost steamvr tracking hdk based around optimization of v2 lighthouse technology.


lastly, and *this is pure and probably hopeful speculation on my part*, this opens the possibility of a smaller, less expensive, and far better tracking puck, either made by valve or a 3rd party. i've got a few things in the works personally that i need a (very out of stock) hdk for that a new improved hdk or tracker would excite me greatly, and possibly excite *you* with what i make with it and how it works :)

Otherwise, contact Vive support.  They usually get back to you pretty quickly.  During office hours their support chat can help as well.

I hate to say this but your laptop is never going to be brilliant for VR with the Cosmos imho.  High res goggles like the Cosmos, Index, Vive Pro, and esp. Reverb really need a good CPU/GPU combo, together with good cooling in order to give good results.  I retired (now home office duties) my Alienware 17r4 gaming laptop with similar specs to yours 6 months ago and built a proper gaming desktop (i9 9900k water cooled, gtx1080ti, 32Gb 3000 ram, 1tb ssd, 4tb hdd) and this has significantly improved my VR enjoyment.  I'm running an Oculus Rift cv1 w/2x sensors and a Cosmos.  Actually, very easy to switch between the 2 systems on the fly.

If a proper desktop gaming PC is out of the question you may want to consider returning the Cosmos and picking up an Oculus Quest and trying its new PC link.  That way you have a nice standalone mobile VR unit with the capability to also play many PCVR games.",Vive

I just upgraded from a 1600 to a 3700 because the 1600 was bottlenecking,Vive
bottlenecking which gpu? would it bottleneck 1660,Vive

aw man this build is getting too expensive,Vive
Did it work? What games are you playing?,Vive
"from the HLVR door talk, it seems like they're trying to build everything from physics interactions that they can. So it might be that having very high quality finger tracking will let you experiment in lots of interesting/precise ways with the environment, whereas touch users will have a somewhat similar experience, though not as precise, and vive users will be stuck with a few hamfisted gestures. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I think it will be more about interesting consequences of the physics implementation, than it will be about hardcoded mechanics for index.",Vive
Right. That was the whole point of my reply.,Vive
I feel ya,Vive

"There are pancake users who likely said there was no way a HL title would be VR only versus VR optional.

Sooner or later the upgrade train passes by leaving people behind.

But yes ... I don't think this will be unplayable or not enjoyable with wands but the Index controllers have to be a significantly different experience.

Or, in my opinion, we  way overpriced ""Touch"" controller for SteamVR users. Paying for unneeded experimental features when a ""knuckles lite"" Touch clone would do the job just fine.",Vive
"Just confirming. On the subject, where would be the best place to buy JUST the controllers? Price and trust wise?",Vive
"Meh... I tried the knuckles for a week and honestly the only game I felt they improved my experience in was Moss. For every other game I absolutely hated them with a burning passion. Even for gripping items I much prefer the Vive grip button. 

I highly doubt there’ll be anything where I feel like I’m missing out on in HL but we shall find out soon ;)",Vive
Only Valve sells the Index and its accessories. You'll have to use mail forwarding service. Use the search function and you'll find some Aussies discussing this very topic. Good luck.,Vive

It's a prequel to half life 2 but a sequel to half life 1.,Vive

so basically search for a walkthrough on how to unblock the mods.",Vive

I'm so happy for you.",Vive
It's going to use every feature of knuckles but be easily playable on anything. For example you won't have to hold the grip on vive wands in order to carry things. I hope.,Vive
"In my head: ""Why would a monitor vibrate?"" \*quick google\* ""ooh, that sort of monitor""  
I assume you mean mounted to something above the speakers rather than just put directly on top? If it is mechanically coupled to the speaker, then it will probably affect tracking and may accelerate degradation of the base station. Otherwise it should be fine.",Vive
Wonder if his depature is anything to do with the terrible Cosmos launch?,Vive

It's like... I love my PS4 Pro. I bought it for $400. If it were $600, I just wouldn't own a PS4 Pro. Ever. I would wait for it to be $400, because that extra couple hundred bucks is never gonna be a worthwhile expenditure to me.

"Unable to run SR_Runtime is a different problem than I have seen.   On our systems SR_Runtime runs fine, and the robot eyes will even turn green during the calibration check, but the results are garbage.

If the basic installation isn't working then I'd probably start by testing the USB port function, and looking at the SteamVR logs, and then if nothing is obviously wrong and fixable, swap out the boot drive and install a clean copy of Windows.",Vive

I did my reaearch for over a month and a b450 motherboard paired with the 3600 and 16gb of ram (identical sticks) was (and still is) the best budget pc i could come up with (maybe a 2600 or 2700 could work, but i wanted the new processor)",Vive

"Seems to be a solid 8/10, although an 8 in today's gaming market means nothing.

The reason why many VR games nowadays seem clunky or unintuitive is because the technology is new. Control schemes are not standardized, and nobody really knows what the best way to go about doings things is. It's comparable to the N64-era of gaming. We're slowly starting to figure things out, and people are finally starting to make more ambitious orojects with the tech, to stretch their creative and technological muscles.",Vive
Damn fair enough,Vive

"&gt; Yes its one fuck up but its their most recent game in sometime, thats enough to make me cautious

And you are welcome to that opinion.

&gt; on top of that i disagree with preorders out of principle as it inherently requires blind trust.

Incorrect. As i've already mentioned, they've earned it currently.

&gt;  To pay for a game without seeing or playing the game is just foolish, no matter who the company is, on top of that to say you would pay double the price of a standard game? It screams more money than sense.

Also incorrect. All that tells you is *how much* trust i have in them remaining.

I've already seen what they did with The Lab. They were responsible for the Vive, and now the Index. These people by all accounts seem to know what they are doing when it comes to VR.

And this is a VR product, placed (we'll see soon?) in their flagship product universe, and they've had several years now to work on it while having the opportunity of being able to dictate how the hardware is going to function alongside.

There are a *lot* of reasons for me to give them my benefit of the doubt.",Vive

i live in south Africa,Vive
This is just a guess but that souds like somethin someone with a shelf full of Vive Cosmos'es would say. Definite red flag in the very least they don't know what they are talking about. No kit or HMD is referred as the Vieve 1.5 commonly.,Vive
Maybe one cable got loose inside. I would try to open up and fix it if I were you. Check the tutorials first.,Vive
Why exactly don't you want an oculus headset? Just wondering because you could get a 5 year old headset or a 5 month old headset for 100$ less,Vive
"Someone was claiming that it'll use the finger tracking in Index (and Oculus) to allow you to use sign language to communicate with Dog.

We'll see on Thursday if that is true and how they'll handle Vive wands (or if they offer a knuckles package for upgrading)",Vive
"I guess that depends what they mean by ""1.5"". There's no such product as a Vive ""1.5"", so I'm guessing the store is just putting that label on themselves.

First and foremost, there aren't counterfeit Vive units. There's plenty of cheap VR headsets, but nothing in the wild that has the Vive / HTC logo on it and tries to look like a Vive.

My guess, this ""1.5"" Vive is referring to the later revision of the first gen Vive. The later revision of the Vive featured blue (instead of grey) straps on the wands, and had the HDMI/USB and power cables stuffed into one cable (there's still 3 cables inside, but they're bound together). I believe the launch Vive had 3 separate cables. Granted both of these things are easy to swap. As far as I know, there aren't any differences in the PCBs/lenses used in the Vive or the controllers, so there's not any practical difference between the launch vives and the ones that came later.",Vive
"Vive is 2 tears old by now. If they release a standalone knuckles package to upgrade it ought to be ok. 

It's like complaining about next gen Consoles when you don't even need to buy a whole new console.",Vive
"Now Christmas can come and I will be getting some gift cards hopefully. So to be ready when the eagle has landed for pre-order.

Uh oh maybe new PC hardware would be great either. Poor Santa will need to let his pants drop these Christmas. But it is for the better. ""Hohoho..""",Vive
"It's fake in the sense that they made up that ""1.5"" label. There is no such thing. It's probably just regular Vive. It's been discontinued and they are trying to get rid of stock. Very sleazy.",Vive
"who on their right mind want to willingly be part of the oculus enviroment?


the headset is ok, and cheap, probably the best starter headset, but its from facebook... that right there is just a shitstain that wont ever go away.
also that ""5yo tech"" is more reliable than the one in the  ""5mo headset""...",Vive
"youll lose the trial when the end date arrives.

you cancel FUTURE subscriptions.",Vive
"Seriously why is this dude being downvoted. He is spitting facts. To answer your questions, this dude seems to have uncovered it all a month ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaXGA_wSWDA",Vive
I expect at least one new title.,Vive
Great work on piecing it all together. You deserve credit and I honestly don't understand why some people hate on your speculation.,Vive
I guess thats possible but just seems a bit weird and overly complicated.,Vive
"There is a much easier method now, https://youtu.be/8ykyS447OF4 6:03",Vive
Interesting.  Will the Australian customs try to charge you GST when you bring them back into the country?  I ask because I'm in Melbourne Australia and have also wanted to buy. I note they can b bought through intermediaries but we end up paying extra for the trouble.,Vive
"You really don't know that, and why do people blindly upvote comments like this without giving it a thought. Valve's strategy for making money isn't centered around selling hardware. It never has been their strategy, and it likely won't ever be. They are invested in, first, getting people into PC gaming if they're not already, and second to get those people onto the steam platform where they'll buy games.

If the math works out that the cost of lowering the price of the hardware is less than the value of those additional people on their platform, then they'll reduce the cost of the hardware.

Steam is also the reason we've not seen more Valve IP over the last decade. They have the luxury of being able to wait for really great ideas to pursue before pursuing anything, all while the checks keep coming in due to steam sales.

Your comment wouldn't annoy me so much if not for the fact that you started with ""Are you kidding?"", as if the premise for his/her statement was so ridiculous....",Vive
"It’s 3.5 years old actually... and will be 4 by the time the game is released. Not the point though. I guarantee the game will be playable perfectly well with Vive wands and Rift Touch. There’s absolutely no way they’ll require knuckles for any sort of key gameplay function. 

On a separate note, I played with the knuckles and I hated them.",Vive
This guy is hilarious,Vive
"Tone does not carry well over the internet.  My comment of ""Are you kidding?"" was more meant as tongue-in-cheek.

That said, the Index has only been out for a couple months.  One other thing Valve prides itself on is listening to customers--and itʻs going to piss off a lot of people who have already spent money adopting the Index if they suddenly drop the price on it.

Economics of it also donʻt make sense.  If you have a thing that people want, you charge people for that thing.  Converse to your argument, if the math works out that they can keep making money at the current price, then theyʻre not going to drop the price.

I don't think we'll see any price drop on the Index until well into 2020 at least.",Vive
"I like this technology!

It would be great for deep sea exploration.",Vive
BANGBANGBANGBANGBANG*TVSMASH*FUCK,Vive
"Ok, hopefully you’ll at least get this up and running ok in VR.  As long as you don’t push game graphics settings and SteamVR super sampling too high and keep an eye on cpu/gpu temps you should be ok.  If you stick with VR for a while I think you will come to the same conclusion that a good gaming desktop is far better for good VR.

Also, make sure your win10 is up to date.  At least 1903 and preferably 1909 (I’m using that now no problem).

Only other things to check is your nvidia control panel 3d settings.  Make sure you select prefer max performance on your power option.  I also recommend selecting a high performance power plan ( when plugged into your wall power supply) and disable any USB power savings.

Like everything, if you can find some good local PCVR help that will help.  Good luck mate.",Vive
Watch it come out before r/HL2VR,Vive
I already got Index controllers with my Vive headset just for VRChat XD,Vive

Hey so I had a thought recently. My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship and I thought maybe getting her a VR headset could help us. Are there any online games that play like GTA5 in the sense that it's open world, you can drive around, and has things we could do together like explore a new area of the map, play tennis, watch TV, etc. Almost like a real-life simulator.

yea exactly what i was thinking because i have a vive and both vive and oculus are avalable here im just hoping that one day we are able to obtain the index as i am interested in getting one.,Vive
"I STRONGLY recommend you not to buy the index from a third party and settle up with the vive pro like i will do, because not only ur gonna void ur warrenty but also pay much much more for the shipping (US shipping adress or something like that), and iv'e ben following the r/valveindex for 
A little while, it appears that they receive a defective controllers with the thumbstick doesn't click and also the drift issue that occurs after 2 or 3 monthes of play with the controllers, so they are requesting mass Rmas because of the defective product, and if ur gonna buy it from third party ur warrenty is rendered useless and you cant do anything if you received defective controllers or it broke after some monthes of play, so be like me and say F*ck you valve and buy the vive pro, since vive pro has the amoled OLED lenses and the wireless advantage, and index has some certain advantages over the index but its the best alternative to it, since you cant do anything about it because of the limited shipping like me.",Vive
"Do you have a picture of the Vive 1.5 from your local retailers? What retailers? What country are you in? How much does it cost? What is included?

It seems odd that multiple retailers have a Vive 1.5 for sale wherever you are since as other people have said no such thing exists. But I'm curious now about my questions above. Thanks in advance for any extra info you got!",Vive
Yea no index for me until they get wireless.  Wireless vibe is too good to ever wire up again.   I did get index controllers though.,Vive

"Yep 100%, totally compatible with the original base stations and they sell them separately specifically so vine owners can upgrade controllers.",Vive
I doubt it. You still can't buy an Index in most of the world. There is still a lot of pent up demand.,Vive
"That's awesome! I haven't looked into upgrading since the vive is still great, but if the index controllers work with existing base stations, I'm sold!",Vive
"I don't get how this makes the Steam Controller dongles Watchman dongles? They turn Vive Controllers into trackers, while I'm just trying to get the dongles to connect my Index to Steam.",Vive
This has got all the default subs buzzing about VR and HL3 again. This was a great move by Valve to support adoption to VR by the masses!,Vive
Yea and they are awesome!,Vive
"I am not sure why that is so unimaginable. Look at Vader immortal....one of the biggest gaming franchises and it is great but still just a smaller experience. I think it is reasonably possible that Half Life Alux could be something like Vader Immortal. I hope not, but it isn't unimaginable.",Vive
"Just my 2 cents....I think the HMD is the bigger upgrade. Going from a Vive to Index was like going from an SD TV to an HD TV. It was a big upgrade. 

The Knuckles ARE better, but personally I think they are less of an upgrade than the HMD upgrade. If it was me I would get the HMD first and knuckles later.",Vive
"I have noticed this with some games as well. No Mans Sky is a perfect example. When I have the desk view active, the performance is noticeably worse. As soon as I minimize it the performance hit goes away.   


I don't know if it is simply poor optimization from developers, or if there really is an overhead load with the preview window all the time but I mostly don't notice it.",Vive
"You are good. 

Source: Aussie with Index controllers. :) 

I ordered the Index kit and had it forwarded through Shopmate. The kit I have is from the U.S. Just be aware that there aren't any stores selling the Index in the U.S (AFAIK)., so you would need to order one and have it shipped somewhere for you to pick it up. But that will require some work as you will need a U.S. steam account etc.",Vive
Half-Life: Combine,Vive
"&gt;It's not nearly as bad as Epic bribing AAA companies

It's worse though. 

At least you don't have to buy Epic hardware to access the games.",Vive
"Frankly this is exactly the problem with the Index controllers. They are way too expensive for just a casual upgrade, so they will never be in enough homes to make it viable for game developers to include anything but cosmetic or inconsequential features for the controllers. And that of course means that people are less likely to buy them at the cost they are because it is a lot of money to spend to get cosmetic features.   


Personally I think Valve should have bit the bullet and released lighthouses for $40 each and the Index Controllers for $100. If they had done that then nearly every Vive owner would have upgraded, because $100 is a hell of a lot more justifiable than $270, and even Oculus and WMR users might have bought the $180 bundle to get knuckles and lighthouses. But at $500 for lighthouses and knuckles, they will never hit critical mass.",Vive
"How long ago was that? I've been battling Vive for months to replace an in-warranty cable, and they say it's literally impossible because their replacement stock is out and they can't give me the ""for-sale"" cables.",Vive
YES,Vive
"Can't remember exactly... April of this year I think (so around 7 months ago).  


I live in NZ where there are some pretty strong consumer laws. I don't know if that factored into it or not as I returned it to the retailer and they got it replaced through Vive for me.  


The only contact I had with HTC was me E-Mailing their support, following their trouble shooting steps which resulted in them telling me to take it to an authorized service center for repair.  


Once I got that response, I took it to the retailer, showed them the E-Mail, quoted the consumer guarantees act and they dealt with it.",Vive
Difference is Epic is a distribution platform and VR is comparable to a vrand new gaming console. VR experiences are *completely* different from any normal PC game.,Vive
which dp-&gt;mdp adapter are you using?,Vive
"Of course. There is plenty of middle ground between $20K and $265M though, so anything higher budget is good. It gives something for the people complaining about any worthwhile high-budget games to chew on. The industry is also steadily chugging along as tech is improved and prices are lowered, so the user percentage on Steam will go up.",Vive

"My theory is that it starts before HL2 introduces alyx and it revolves around mechanics using alyx and dog to solve puzzles and win fights. Mainly because I feel like being dog in VR would be cool but also because it's obvious dog will be in this game so why not make the game mechanics revolve around him? Maybe it's a child version of alyx and You have to pick alyx up, move objects around and save her from danger. Or maybe it's right before HL2 and it's adult alyx and you get guns but you also have to order dog around to do things... who knows.",Vive

won't work. 3rd party dongles use a different chip.... and are bluetooth not the custom protocol steam controller ships with.,Vive
"Also it is good to know that is even better 3d than any previous 3DTV or cinema you have experienced because you were always at a fixed point of view and also the content you are actually watching. 
BTW, There are movies that you can see in VR that you are actually watching it as another actor. Also there is game called The invisible hours that you are an invisible actor while the movie is happening around you and you can handle the time and witness what happens at any specific moment on different locations.... another mindblowing VR moment :P",Vive
As long as your glasses aren't too wide to fit inside the headset you'll be fine. There is also an adjuster to move the lenses away from your face to avoid glasses scratching them.  Otherwise there are companies such as VR Optician that sell prescription inserts that you can place inside the headset.,Vive

[Base station updates then won't turn on.](/r/Vive/comments/dyuquy/base_station_updates_then_wont_turn_on/) by  ManWithQuestionsPC


So I bought my VIVE last Christmas and it worked fine for a few months until I updated both base stations and one just refused to turn on. I had this issue for a few days before I manually restored an older version of the software inside the base station which seemed to fix it but calibration was hugely off. This solution worked fine until I upgraded my PC and in a moment of stupidity updated the base station and the issue has started again.   


If anyone else had this issue and knows of a solid solution it would be greatly appreciated, I followed what instructions I could find on VIVE's website to no avail.

"Virtual reality replicates how 3D vision works in the real world. Stereopsis (different images for both eyes) is just one aspect of it. Due to that, it's a quite a lot more ""3D"" than 3D movies or anaglyphic (red/blue) images.

I think the best way to explain the difference it is to explain how VR works on a perceptual level: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ0TV2jgNoc (25 minute talk).",Vive

"If real, it’s likely that an announcement would include information he doesn’t know about in advance, e.g. a trailer with gameplay footage.",Vive
"Obviously the 9900k can handle it, it’s literally the best gaming cpu and has 8c16t",Vive
"The deluxe audio strap is a solid solid investment if you've got the og vive.

I'm pretty sure I picked it up for a hundred bucks on Amazon.

And while you're there and getting spendy look into replacing the foam mask thingo with the leather ones from Amazon, they're awesome and don't turn into a wet sponge after 20 minutes of beat saber.",Vive
"I feel like I regularly see the deluxe audio strap for 75 bucks on eBay. It really changes the experience. If people say your OG strap feels like it's going to fall off, consider placing it so that really cups the back of the skull. It is supposed to grip that bulbous part really nicely, not just fit like a sports cap. So you may have to loosen the top strap more and really fit over their head.",Vive
Yep the leather pad was the first thing I bought haha. I hated the foam.,Vive
Are you trying to flex or?,Vive
"Is that a joke? Flex what? That I have a 5 yr old 4th gen cpu? I didnt mention if I did get wireless it would be used. So I guess I have to ask, you bitter?",Vive
You said 9900k it’s literally the best cpu,Vive
"Speaking from experience or just 'it's a 9900k'?  Obviously beat saber, aimple games it'll be fine, but how about those already cpu intense games like fallout, dirt, is the 9900k maxing out there?

Thats why I'm looking for actual owner feedback.",Vive
Wireless Vive Pro Runs perfect on my I7 8700,Vive
"Vr can break the chicken and the egg problem with a foveated rendering and 4k per eye headset. Right now there is a trade off for all VR games: you get an increased sense of immersion in exchange for inferior visuals. With foveated rendering this trade off disappears, and playing a game in VR becomes both better in terms of immersion and in terms of display fidelity. 

If we can reach that point it then makes sense to simply port most 3rd person action games to VR and have people use a controller to play them like they would normally. At this point the chicken and the egg problem is solved as VR ports using controllers are not very expensive to make, but with a sufficiently advanced VR headset they could be quite compelling. Unfortunately this means motion controls and the VR game market as we know it will largely be left behind, but it will be necessary to take VR mainstream.",Vive
"9900K is literally the fastest gaming CPU in existence. If it couldn't handle wireless then almost no one could use it.

Anyway, as far as what you need for the WA, for regular Vive anything with 4 cores/8 threads+ is good enough. You may be able to get away with 4/4, but it's not completely ideal. Vive Pro you need 6 cores+, with SMT also being a plus, but not necessarily required. 

I'd recommend something like the  Ryzen 3600, 3700X, 3900X, i7 8700K, i7 9700K, i7 9900K. Second gen Ryzen (2600/2600X/2700/2700X) can also run it (personal experience), and i5 9600/8600 probably would also be fine, but if buying new you may as well get one of the previously listed CPUs.",Vive
"Don't go with a Vega for VR. Vega/Fury and older AMD GPUs perform worse in VR than they should. Apparently that's been fixed with Navi (5700/5700 XT). 

Used you can always get a better deal, but try to buy from a reputable seller and preferably a card that still has some warranty left.",Vive
"VR you're honestly almost always GPU limited, even with an older CPU, except with a few rare games. You have to push a lot of pixels to maintain VR resolutions at 90 fps.",Vive
"I have a desktop with i9 9900k over clocked to 5Ghz on all cores and water cooled.  Also a gtx1080ti with some oc (100 core, 300 memory), plus 32Gb 3000 ram.  I also have a Vive Cosmos and I recently bought the wireless kit for it.

For me the application that hammers my pc the hardest is X Plane 11.  This is mainly because it is currently poorly optimized for multi threading.  This should improve in the next 3-6 months as it starts to use Vulkan (Vulcan?).

I’m able to run xp11 wired at pretty high settings and still maintain a nice smooth 45 FPS.  With wireless this drops down to 35 fps.  So the wireless system in this case is knocking off about 20-25% performance.  In order to get back to 45 FPS I need to drop my super sampling down quite a bit.

Assetto Corsa performance also suffers a bit as well, around 15% loss when using wireless.

None of my other VR apps/games seem to play differently with wireless.  I’m not a big gamer so I don’t really have many of the latest games.

Anyway I hope this information is of some use.",Vive
"Motion controls are not going anywhere. They are need to differentiate the experience in VR. That’s why we do not use game pads with 99% of VR games.
The tech you talk about its still years away in becoming affordable ($400-500 all in)
Porting 2d games to VR is not easy you will not get a good experience a lot of the time unless you work at it.
This is going to be a slow hall until the tech gets cheaper, better and we get some killer AAA games to sell it.
At least it seems like we are on a path to get there",Vive
"Yeah I sadly don't really have 75 bucks for the strap sadly. The vive to me feels alright, I finally found a point in turning the knobs to make it feel right, it still just feels kinda weird.",Vive
"I'm interested to know what knobs you are talking about. The real OG vive is all velcro &amp; elastic, perhaps I haven't seen yours if it's an updated model. But if you do have just the elastic, maybe think about modifying welding mask headgear, which is made for this purpose and has a similar backing to WMR or PSVR headsets, a knob that contracts or expands. That's what's recommended for the DIY project North Star Headset. Here are some [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=welding+mask+headgear&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2) as low as $5. I bet you could also get one used or trashed.",Vive
"Whoops, nevermind. I realized I was thinking of the wrong thing, I meant like.. I found the best position for the velcro for it to be the best length to actually fit right.",Vive
It's not really any different than watching others play football or other sports on TV.,Vive
"The best advice I ever got was from my close friend who convinced me to get a vive . 

“Tighten it, so tight it is almost uncomfortable*

I just did that till i got used to it and it doesn’t bother me anymore.  Probably just my paranoia of it falling of my head and breaking.",Vive

VR is my wallet's downfall.  My main monitor is only 1080p, and honestly 4670k serves just fine for that, the cpu upgrade would be solely to keep up for VR and wireless.",Vive

"1080s are 300 on eBay. If you're a flat gamer, I'd save up for an rtx card. Ray tracing is going to be huge once consoles incorporate it. 2060 supers are 400 new though.

I went from a 970 to a 1080 and I literally used 250%ss on almost every game before buying a pimax 5k so you'll be set with that card if you go that route",Vive
"It's worth noting that OpenXR (and Oculus's LibOVR) support layered rendering.

The idea is that some elements of the screen can be drawn at a normal resolution, but things like UI elements can be rendered much higher with strong anti-aliasing and (depending on what they are, eg rectangles) the HMD driver can play some special tricks to make them look sharper.

IMO the effective angular resolution on most 2nd-generation headsets (Quest/Index/Rift S/Vive Pro) is fine for game worlds (though obviously higher would be better), but text and UI elements could really do with a resolution bump.

Interestingly, this approach tends to be used quite heavily on the Quest - giving you sharp UIs while rendering the world at quite a low resolution.",Vive

Hmm,Vive
"This is a pretty cool way to get a low cost solution for the resistive feedback I still think having things pull back on your fingers is the way to go because it has less limitations space wise, but it is more bulky and costly. 

For small scale operations and feedback this would work great if there was a way to fill them with an air/water mixture you could make it also simulate the weight of objects but this would make it more bulky and it would be hard to drain the ballon without changing its shape drastically. Also you would have to deal with the inertia of the water filled balloons if you move your hands around quickly.

Some online stores have stock like eBuyer but I assume it might depend on the country you are in,Vive
"I mostly agree, though I can see some solutions to those issues. A compressed air canister that can be refilled and and inserted into an arm mounted rig could work, and balloons can be made out of a lot of different things, not to mention inserted in more places, like on the pads of your palm and insides of your knuckles, a much better solutions for long term use, as the balloon would inflate to fill your hand while the pinch balloons could be used more sparingly.

you don't use canned or compressed air because it will blow dust into the optic tube, and that is damn hard to remove. also, most canned air is really some form of aerosol propellant, and this can fuck with optics and coatings, especially plastic lenses... even if you hold it upright and it's not shooting freezing liquid propellant.",Vive

Where are you guys getting the lenses?  The kits sold on eBay?,Vive
"Motion controls will still exist as an optional add on for headsets, but the real mass seller will be playing ports using a controller. Motion controllers are needed right now because playing games you could otherwise play on a TV on a vr headset is simply not that compelling. The vr mode will need to lower the graphics settings and will simply look worse than if you viewed it on the TV. With foveated rendering those graphic compromises don't need to be made, and with 4k it will look close to as sharp add it does on your tv. 

Price is another advantage of this approach. If motion controls are optional headsets should be able to be made for around 250-$350, which falls nicely into the normal consumer expected price for an add on product. Porting non motion controlls games to use motion controls is hard, which is why we don't have many good ports, but porting to use a controller and a vr headset really isn't very hard. 

Vr can survive without going down this route, but I wouldn't expect the same kind of growth we had the last few years. Lots of companies lost lots of money in the vr market. Investors expected a larger market by now and are getting spooked. AAA games require a lot of money to make, so it doesn't make sense to expect any for a long time. It will be indie games, slow growth, and a few larger games made at a loss for the foreseeable future.",Vive
You would need Vive Tracker USB dongles in order for the controllers to communicate with the computer. Or Steam Controller dongles that have been flashed to do the same thing.,Vive

"Just removing controllers obviously won't lead to mass adoption, but removing them on a much better headset with controller ports to AAA games will. Oculus was fundamentally right that controllers were the right choice for mass adoption, the problem was that the headset tech just wasn't good enough to justify the annoyance and cost of VR yet. Yes this headset tech is probably 4ish years out still, but by then the vr market will still be small and dominated by indie devs.

This is coming from one of those indie dev who is currently working on a vr title with motion controls. Motion controller games will always have their place, but mass adoption won't happen any time soon if motion controls are required to make vr compelling.",Vive

motion sickness is a matter of slowly getting the body used to it to develop resistance.  It's likely doable for most, but a vocal minority seems adamant they can't do it...",Vive
"alright, sounds less expensive, thanks!",Vive
"Tried this.   Wow, was it ever stuttery.",Vive
"Just to be super duper clear, you need one dongle per controller. There are guides out there as well for aligning the SteamVR playspace with the WMR one, since even though the chaperone boundaries in SteamVR show up properly, the coordinates for tracking the controllers will be off at first.",Vive
"Probably because he actually does not know in any way, and may be proven right if the rumors he's started/ heard just happen to be true.  Either way its kind of funny",Vive
"So is it possible to use Veryjos to get the head tracking and 3d then use the grandtheftvr.com to handle guns and movement? Is this ok to use just this first one as it lets you shoot from in vehicle.

"&gt; So first of all, can she see clearly up to to 2m away IRL ? if she can she doesn't need to wear glasses in the HMD.

I think you might be overestimating the level of vision of some of us",Vive
"Maybe a driver issue? Have you contacted htc support? Any error codes?

What steps have you taken so far?",Vive
"Im not overestimating anything, i m not assuming anything, i m asking if she can,... 2m is the focal distance of most hmd, if i remember right the vive is more like 1,5m",Vive
"Thanks 💕💗
Sadly it's none of these ^^""",Vive
"Didn't work for me unfortunately.. So I'm guessing the Bluetooth dongles themselves got kinda screwed up due to whatever caused the random reboot

Might try to flash them or something but will wait until I reinstall windows and see if that does anything!
Thanks again tho! 💗",Vive
"Simply turn on mirroring and you can see everything on your screen, some games have a display on your screen by default.",Vive
"Thanks. Ended up having to change my floor layout to face my monitor, but honestly, doing that once was less effort than getting up and walking across the room to put on the headset every 10  seconds over and over lol.",Vive
"I’ve always thought the solution to this would come from essentially a full body suit, with cables that run throughout. 

The cables would tighten and loose based on what you were trying to do. Running through water? The cables built into your legs give more resistance. Trying to pick up a heavy object? Cables in your arms and back make it impossible. Grabbing a rock? Cables get tense at the exact dimensions of the rock so that it feels like you grabbed onto it. 

I think it would work well in simulating resistance in the real world.",Vive
"I keep my floor space facing away and just make sure my HMD is facing the monitor before starting Steam VR and I've not had a problem yet. Try that and see if it helps.

I've been using this a lot for modding Skyrim / FO4 and checking fps with different texture mods, it's so much easier :)",Vive

answer 2: not yet

answer 3: nope

"Man, it would be awesome if max vollmer could get the HL1VR public beta out before then--that would be amazing for the stream.  But maybe he's also waiting for the HL anniversary and we'll get lucky",Vive
"That sounds amazing and I hope they one day get to that point- the one thing I can't help but picture is it would have to be ""light tension"" as if it tightened too hard it could seriously hurt the wearer.",Vive
Thanks! Yeah I ended up getting and testing it out with my sony ones and while it sits a little more tilted forward it hasn't been an issue :),Vive
"they're not actually bluetooth. they're steamvr, which is why there's no lag and why you need one per tracked device.",Vive
"where do i get the veryjos mod? I found this https://github.com/veryjos/GTAV_OpenVR

Cool! Seems to be pretty bulky though especially for consumer use,Vive
[This ](https://haptx.com)  exists,Vive
I really liked their demonstration of button-style interactions in AR. Turning flat surfaces into malleable ones. Cool stuff!,Vive
"Yeah, unfortunately this is a general issue with the Oculus friends matchmaking right now. It's being discussed in the Revive discord, but the gist of it is that if no Oculus headset is connected, then the Oculus service will not send a needed heartbeat and eventually the service will consider you disconnected and remove you from the game... There are some ideas for possible workarounds being explored, but right now, without Oculus hardware, it doesn't work :(",Vive
I see. Thanks for the information.,Vive
I just bought a GearVR from Amazon and had my adapters printed using 3dhubs.com,Vive
"Definitely not at that wear and go level everyone’s after, but it seems inevitable that it will exist at some point. So cool",Vive
"I'm glad yours work for you so well but ""no distortion fix needed"" is not a valid claim they can make. 

At best they test their lens and ensure you win the GearVR lens lottery to minimize issues but ""no distortion fix"" is basically a lie. There is no universal distortion fix either. It's a calibration process unique to every headset/lens combo.

Just applying some settings from another user isn't enough. It might be ""good enough"" for the average person but it's still far from distortion free will be worse than the stock lens.",Vive
"Can't find it either, been using VPN and trying different countries, but no luck. Usually setting my VPN to UK does the trick for this kind of content.",Vive
Can you not buy it on eBay?,Vive
Currently $60 extra and ships from China. I’m doing this for work and they were not ok with this route.,Vive
Loads to headset but this is not 3d looks like borderlands 2 VR did at launch,Vive
"Yeah, they are all gone. I managed to snag one from Amazon.ca last week, but they are also out of stock there.",Vive
Are you connected to a USB-3 port and not USB-2? Also try running the software as Administrator plus the usual stuff like make sure all drivers are up to date and the OS is patched. Mine is running very well and any issues I've had have been transient and I've never had a problem with the setup so it seems to be a local issue on your PC's that;s why I mentioned the USB connection. Tracking is still a on-going issue but they just released a new firmware [1.0.8.3](https://1.0.8.3) BETA (you have to join the beta program in Vive console (once you get it running) which greatly improved it so in my estimation it is almost the same as Windows MR HMD's at this point tracking wise but much better visually. Also in a few months the Vive base stations and tracking attachment for the HMD will be available if you prefer that. Let us know how you go. Cheers!,Vive
"Like I said, it's because modern vr headsets do not provide a compelling experience without the addition of motion controls currently. Once that changes then motion controllerless vr makes a lot of sense for the average gamer. What I'm saying is that foveated rendering fundamentally changes the game. It didn't make sense to play AAA controller ports on your vr headset because they just looked worse than on your 4k tv, but once we get high res and foveated rendering vr objectively becomes the best way to play normal games.

I could be wrong about high res and foveated rendering headsets. They could end up being still less compelling than the tv/monitor for most games. If that's the case though, I wouldn't expect the mainstreaming of vr for at least another 10 years. It would require hundreds of millions in game development investment loss to get past the chicken and the egg problem. I just don't see that in an environment where investors are already pressuring companies like Facebook about the lackluster vr growth.

The most likely future for a motion controller based vr ecosystem is slow but consistent growth, indie games, and a slowdown in investment. That's fine by me, buy we shouldn't expect AAA vr content any time soon then.",Vive
"so you can hands down play any vr game (most at max settings) for at least a couple of years with gtx 1660 and rift s? (boo asking this in a vive subreddit, im on a budget)",Vive
"Holy mother of VR, its happening!",Vive
I fixed this a while ago by connecting my dk2 camera to the computer. If you have one try that.,Vive
Are you sure that is an official twitter account? - there are lots of fake ones.,Vive
My buddy at Valve just confirmed it with me. It's definitely happening.,Vive

"An announcement for an announcement, what a world we live in. But then again, what a good announcement it is.",Vive
HOW DO WE KNOW YOU ACTUALLY KNOW SOME ONE AT VALVE.... is what people say all the time to me when I comment on Blizzard or Obsidian games lol. I'm excited!,Vive
"I've used the Vive, Oculus and Index. Index is the only one I own now and it's fantastic.",Vive
"Keeping my expectation low. I am betting its less HL3 and more like HL VR ""tech demo"" spin off which is mostly independent and doesn't expand on the original games",Vive
"Ya without even trying them, im sure Valve got it spot on. I mean, VIVE and Oculus only exist thanks to Valve showing Oculus their VR room.",Vive
"The screen is fantastic, it lowered motion sickness compared to the other models, the controllers are solid and so are the light houses. No complaints at all.",Vive
"It's weird that valve never had a twitter account before and that they're using this to mention the game.

But it looks like the steam twitter account is retweeting this, so it's almost certainly legit.

I'm curious as well. I have the Index running on a GTX 970. Upgrading in the next few months. Was set on the 2080Ti. But if I could save a few...,Vive
Idk 2080 ti's can't handle red dead on ultra at 60fps even,Vive
youre going to sell your gtx 970 right? also is there any game unplayable on 970?,Vive
4k is more demanding than vr tho isnt it,Vive
Valve and ex-valve staffers have already retweeted it,Vive
"Not really at max settings.  The Rift S and the original Vive are about as demanding on a video card.  and I would never recommend an Index or a Vive Pro for a GTX 1660 Ti or Super.

Always buy the best video card that you can afford for VR.  If you are going to spend a few hundred dollars on a HMD, don't ruin the VR experience by cheaping out on a video card.  Continuously playing at 45Hz/45 FPS is less than ideal.",Vive
"A RTX 2080 Super might be able to save you some cash over buying a Ti:

"Yeah that is a very good point, but it does have a Verified badge and it has survived for 3 months so far, also a few news sources are picking it up. So far I am hopeful.",Vive
Aaaaaaaaa! Great news! Finally! A valve game which is a half life game and in vr 😍,Vive
I can't even get it in Canada still =(,Vive
"second that! og vive/oculus go before. it´s a complete new experience.but with a bit less vivid colours because lcd and not oled.wouldnt go back though,maybe only for a few(space) apps..",Vive
"Are you kidding?  People will buy the Index just to play this, it's not likely they're going to drop the price.",Vive
"neither can i afford index or vive pro, so ill be fine with gtx 1660? i could actually live with lower settings?",Vive
I win.,Vive
See you on the front page!,Vive
No fuckin way. Finally a reason to pull the vive out of storage!,Vive
"Yeah I doubt it will be a HL3, however they did say it is going to be their ""flagship VR game""  So it better be more then a tech demo",Vive
"This is the way to go. 90% of me is keeping hopes low, but 10% is thinking, ""Oh fuck VALVE is finally showing off a new game, and not a MOBA card game but a ""Flagship VR title"" so that gets my acorn on wet ngl",Vive
This really should have come out three years ago with the release of the Vive.,Vive
"yeah, I hope it wont be wolfensteinVR or similar rubbish,but I dont think so..it´s valves first vr flagship title in the dawn of index..i bet they will use the cameras for something or another totally new gimmick :) fingers crossed,that it will released in 2019 and not march 2020,like the leak stated..",Vive
Alyx in Latin is 3.  I'm pretty sure...,Vive
Tyler jizzing hard on stream,Vive
"Which GTX 1660?  

If it's the vanilla 1660, consider it entry-level VR.  It will work OK with an OG Vive or Rift CV-1 at lowered settings or with older/less demanding games.  Just make sure that your expectations are not too high for newer VR games and do not push the setting beyond what your hardware can achieve or you run the risk of ruining your VR experience.",Vive
"well all i want is play popular vr titles, idc how bad quality or resolution, just playable, on a rift s because i want inside out tracking for portability",Vive
The application for VR porn is certainly there!,Vive
It's green.,Vive
9 women can give birth to one baby in a month!,Vive
"Don't ask how I know this. 

But I'm hearing that their may be a second Half Life related announcement in the cards.

Don't hold me to it though.",Vive
"If valve announced an announcement of an announcement of an announcement of an announcement of a Half-Life game, it would've been a big deal.",Vive
its probably the reason why they removed the HL2 VR mod capability which they released for the oculus Developement Kit. And never added back for their own vive etc. This is probably just HL2 with a little bit improved motion controls and on source 2 engine.,Vive
I just wish they had a wireless adapter,Vive
"Valve isnt trying to make a quick buck off headsets though.

If they feasibility can lower the cost, they will.

I wouldnt even doubt if the reason they released it so soon without HL:A, is so they can hopefully sell enough that the cost of production drops, and thus, the cost can drop.",Vive
How much will this game be or was it not said? I love VR but spending 40-60 dollars on games that barely take 5ish hours to complete D: idk,Vive
Literally everything official we know about the game is in the tweet above.,Vive
Valve pricing is usually pretty reasonable (ignoring Artifact of course).,Vive
Gotcha thanks. At work so I can't click links right now my bad,Vive
For sure :) I'm sure artifact wouldn't of been so bad if it was free to play like MTG:arena/hearthstone lol,Vive
You're not wrong.,Vive
"Lol, no fucking way that this is just a mod for HL2. It's a prequel single-player campaign.",Vive
that it is going to be a prequel has never been announced no?,Vive
"Could you imagine if the switch came out and three years after it’s release Nintendo had zero first party games?  No Zelda, no Mario (Kart, Party, Odyssey, etc.)",Vive
You can always lower the resolution and the quality settings.  Good luck!,Vive
"Just went through this. Probably spent a dozen hours fucking around with my computer, drivers, switching out HDMI cables. The fix was to remove the HDMI cable from the linkbox to the computer and replace it with a miniDP (on the linkbox) to the DP on the graphics card.",Vive
"Bro, it hasn't been released worldwide yet.. don't hold your breath.",Vive
"Either this is half life 3 or it’s a demo but also confirms that HL3 is coming, and it will be on VR. I’m stoked either way.",Vive
Will be interesting to see if Valve announces a Index+Free copy of Half Life:Alyx deal,Vive
"A lot of people will get VR for this, but basic economics suggests that the majority will buy lower cost headsets.",Vive
Oh yeah this is their first tweet ever! The account was created this June.,Vive
Chu motherfucking chu chuu!! All aboard!!!,Vive
"I for one do not care if it 120$, i still know i will be pre-ordering it. Valve is one of the few companies i still have confidence in.

(except for Artifact, that was doa)",Vive
"You arent wrong. I had not yet upgraded to an index, but this is probably what will do it for me.",Vive
"I suspect this is because there were some leaks, so they ended up having to give some kind of confirmation to avoid rumor craziness.",Vive
The lab was their tech demo. This will be the result if years of development following that...,Vive
Yeah that is super weird.,Vive
Wonder if Index will ever be available outside of Europe and the US?,Vive
"Ya not sure why they dont sell on Amazon.

There is fake ""valves"" on amazon selling it for double the price.",Vive
Lol everyone who owns VR well buy half life at any price.,Vive

[HTC is out of Replacement Parts](/r/Vive/comments/dydokh/htc_is_out_of_replacement_parts/) by  dornadigital


Be warned if you attempt to get replacement parts from HTC... Apparently they don't have any. They spent weeks messing with me before admitting they couldn't do anything. That was months ago, and my in-warranty headset still can't power on. They also said they couldn't extend the warranty, so I guess I just have to sit and hope I get the part sometime in the next decade.

"I’d jump on a Rift S tbh with you, it costs $399 saving effectively $600 compared to an Index and you’ll get access to the whole Oculus library which has some fantastic exclusives as well as anything on Steam through Steam VR, there’s not really a big reason to buy an Index for that much extra.

**Hardware** \- I go into a little detail about the past and why I think VR didnt take off as much as industry insiders expected. I then talk about the new headsets we have had launch this year

Oculus launched the Rift S and Quest in May, Valve launched the Index in June and HTC launched something called the cosmos no one gives a shit about.

We now have 3 new headsets that cater to different audiences and give more options with the quest an affordable option for people without a pS4 or Gaming PC, Rift S is priced well and easy to setup with inside out tracking and the Index for those with deeper pockets who want less compromises.

You also still have the PSVR which is the cheapest and most affordable of all of them if you have a PS4 already with them dropping to $200-250 on a regular basis.

Its now never been easier for someone to get in to VR gaming, the Quest is selling well and overall we have turned a corner in terms of accessability and ease of use while having a significant step forward in visual clarity and comfort.

**Software** \- Back in the beginning of Consumer VR the games were very basic with lots of short indie wave shooters and things that felt more like tech demos rather than the Fully Fleshed out VR games we want. Developers were playing it safe with lots of games using Teleportation movement, especially the exclusive stuff from Oculus and Sony.

Big AAA games take along time to develop with large teams of people working full time on them and cost alot of money. Only now after 3 years of Consumer VR are we starting to see the big games we have dreamt of like Asgards Wrath, Blood and Truth and Stormland with Iron Man VR, Medal of Honor and Lone Echo 2 on the Horizon. 

They are all exclusives but we are also seeing smaller indie developers really start to get to grip with VR game development with some of the earlier studios bringing out some next level games terms of scope and world interactions, Games like Boneworks, Walking Dead Saints and Sinners, Espire:1 etc and we have lots more games in the works that we know of and alot that will be announced next year.

Overall I think this has been a massive year for VR gaming with some big steps forward for both hardware and software, we also have the PS5 confirmed next year which will support the current PSVR plus loads more excellent games that feel like a generation forward.

Do people agree with me or am I just talking out of my Poo Pipe?",Vive
"&gt;Get the GTX1660TI. It is comparable with the GTX1070, except it is newer, in the same price range and contain various new features for VR and non-VR titles due to the tuning architecture, such as ray-tracing.

I have the K version without an overclockable board and a GTX 1080. I can still play but get plenty of frame drops and less then stellar performance. The CPU also needs an upgrade.",Vive
"Where in the world are you?
If you live in a country with decent consumer rights laws then you should be able to get the unit fixed/replaced without too much hassle.

My HMD was a little over a year old and was unusable because of its tracking issues.

Got it replaced and its been perfect ever since.",Vive
https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/dx2ohb/possible_gta_v_vr_revive_fix/,Vive
"Hard to say.  Your tracking issues are kinda unusual, assuming you've done all the normal stuff to try and deal with it(get rid of any notable reflective surfaces around, etc).  

There's certainly other options, but I dont know your use cases.  

I get your frustration, I hate when shit just doesn't work properly, but that's my warning with the Index here - there's a lot of potential frustrations down that road, too.  I think lack of common compatibility in whatever VR game/app you want to play would probably be my biggest issues. Plus, depending on what's causing your tracking issues, given it still uses Lighthouse tracking, there's a chance that issue will remain, too.  Just seems like a big risk given how much it costs.",Vive
"This could probably be tested out.  Unplug one of the lighthouses and with the one still active, play something that lets you stay mostly forward facing(towards the lighthouse).  Then try the other one and see if there's any notable issue with either.",Vive
"Happens with several games! Observer for example, a technohorror Blade Runner inspired game starring Rutger Hauer, would boot straight to a Vive if you have it -vr. Albeit terrifyingly janky with you floating above your character's headless body.",Vive
Lol,Vive
"Despite the new hardware I sold my headset this year and am now waiting for some more substantial progress. As an early vr enthusiast im looking forward to more compact micro oled headsets and more immersive high quality aaa experiences. I think social vr done right has a lot of potential but that’s gone nowhere really with most of them not amounting to much.

I feel even if everyone was given some future advanced high quality headset today we simply don’t have the quality games or experiences to really make the most of it. Nothing with any depth or longevity that people return to daily at least.",Vive
"Yeah, my bad",Vive
Tracked controllers finnally added to that mod?,Vive
Link your channel.,Vive
"Sorry brother, but none of this happened to mine. I could rant about Index though.",Vive
"So Veryjos = Downsider and now = Romeo615Videos? 
Either way think he had issues with it being too violently real in VR to want to continue working on it. Was the best GTA V mod out of all them still though.",Vive
"From a technical standpoint yes. Appealing to algorithms tho is not something I would call good artistry. I did watch the video in the end so here it goes:  


Yes dude is very likeable. Yes he speaks in a manner that makes it understandable. Yes this video is very well edited. Yes hes doing his best to be entertaining. Yes hes not bad at playing this game. Yes he has made a 6 minute video and called it a guide.",Vive
"This would have been a really good VR game. Valve should give them a check and a ""hint hint."" It's an interesting game.",Vive
"My headset used to take forever to start tracking - like upwards of ten minutes sometimes - and had lots of problems with greyouts while playing. I thought I had a bad lighthouse as well, but it turned out one of the sensors on the headset itself was bad. I'd disconnected one lighthouse when trying to track it down, and the headset would connect quickly and track perfectly, as long as I was facing away from the active lighthouse. The sensor below my left eye was screwy. I covered it with electrical tape and since then it's been rock solid, and that includes using tpcast wireless.

Maybe worth some experimenting - tracking that down was one of the most frustrating things I've ever dealt with computer-wise and I've been around a while. :)

Good luck, I hope you can solve it.",Vive
"That's odd, because the game has very positive reviews on steam. A lot of people saying ""expected this to be bad, but it's surprisingly really good""",Vive
Looks awesome!,Vive
This still doesn't work properly (yet).,Vive
"nope, sadly. I hope they add it soon. I'll add to this thread when they update the gta vr mod.",Vive
"Software is lacking... content is king. There isn't much compelling software out there yet, and I find myself looking at the money spent on my Index and PC...and wondering if it was worth it?",Vive
"Try OpenVR's [Manual Redirected Walking](https://youtu.be/9INusykanzQ) feature. You rotate your VR space with a controller so you can walk in any arbitrary direction, any distance, without leaving your room.",Vive
"I saw it there a day or two ago.

Apparently, it's a Viveport Infinity exclusive, so keep looking. Are you not searching for ""game of thrones?""",Vive
"Shit, you just reminded me of the horrible customer service of HTC, and it's so close to Christmas too! why would you do this to me?",Vive
"no problem here. I'm pretty sure the trackpad issue is fixed on newer controllers.

My launch Vive (and the one after that) both had trackpad problems.",Vive
Thanks!,Vive
It's getting great reviews on steam as well. I really hope someone can work on this,Vive
"Lot's of VR games for Vive require fast bow shooting, so I didn't really have any trouble with that part. The only issue I had was that since movement is mapped to touching the touchpad and buttons are mapped to clicking it, clicking buttons would cause me to move.",Vive
Yes both super and non I believe,Vive
SSD and 5.0ghz cpu solved that problem for me :p,Vive
"Some questions and ideas

Questions 
1. Why did pc crash?
2. What did you do to stop the pc from crashing again?
3. Did you try hook vr to another pc ? Btw does not need to be fast enough to run it just to see if start normal
4. Have you uninstall all software related and reinstalled them?
Ideas
1. For a lot of pc issues increasing ram helps 
2. An anti-virus and or anti-malware program will interfere with any file in use' make vr software an exception
3. Make sure there is enough space free even after all software installed 25 gb+
4. Some time plunging hi traffic usbs in separate bus helps with hiccups lag
5. Unplug any and all unrelated usbs ex: microphone, web cam, external HD

Hope any of this help.",Vive
"I've tried this a couple times but it always messes up my play space to the point where if I stand in the center of my space, I can see the room bounds like ten meters away from me.",Vive
"Minecraft VR mod is probably the best experience I've had. Also mind blowing that it's the full game and just a mod to create a reasonable VR interface, so you can add other mods. 

That one was one of the first available though so it's a little telling that nothing has beat it in 4 years.",Vive
"I sold my Vive Pro and was thinking of buying a Valve Index but now I'm thinking about the Rift S, if at all. As a day 1 Vive owner, day 1 Vive pro owner, I feel like the content has not progesses this year (we finally have 2 good games just released, Oculus exclusives).

The Rift S is going on sale for $350, so that makes the Index almost three times the cost. I don't mind if they have enough games to make up for the price, but they don't.",Vive
the vorpx version will run without vorpx soon https://grandtheftvr.com/,Vive
"Sarcasm is never wasted! 🤣

Being a former Vive, and now a Rift S user I can sympathise with OP's VR woes. VR is rarely a consistently seamless experience, but at least the rift hardware seems to be a little more robust!",Vive
I remember updating my basestations' firmware when I first got them May this year. I had a quick google and I don't think there's any new firmware updates for the basestations.,Vive
"when they are on an operating, do you see the array of dull red leds, as well as a red smudge on each of the 2 inside edges of the array? in other words, do you see the array and 2 dull red lights that aren't the array on each base station? the ones that aren't in the array are the lasers, and should look like they move when you move your position, the array will stay fixed.


you are hoping for an array and 2 lasers visible on each base station. if in doubt, you can take a picture with your phone of each one and post them here and i'll take a look.",Vive
"It *really* depends on each game! Many simpler VR games are quite easy on cpu, sim stuff often is not, I suspect Talos may be fairly cpu heavy.

Get fpsVR on steam (it's cheap) and find out if any of your games have a cpu bottleneck. If you turn up game details *and* also reduce SS (i.e. make sure the GPU is not limiting fps, while loading the cpu) you should get a good idea.

The 16X nvidia's do not have ray tracing hardware, despite what people here keep saying. They do have some improvements for new VR rendering that make them a better bet than ""equal"" performance older cards though (at least in newer stuff that can take advantage of it). 1660ti/super are probably the best value.",Vive
"I have vorpX (which is god damn amazing by the way), maybe I'll give it a shot.",Vive
The GTX nvidia's do not have ray tracing hardware. RTX cards do.,Vive
"There is certainly no were near as much VR content that is being release compared PC games and consoles. You have literally 100’s of games released every day on those platforms. It’s to the point that there is no way you could play all them even if you want to. With so many games you have a few each week that are very good and worth playing. We are awash in 2d content.

If you look at steam there are 1 or 2 VR titles released almost every day. Most of it is shovel ware. But we are getting something worth playing at least once a month. So there is a good amount of content. Just stuff that is not the highest quality, or might not hit a genre that every one is interested in.

We are not going to get the 30-100 million games until we have 100’s of millions of hmd’s (most big 2d titles come out on all platforms)

It’s just a fact the current hmd’s (and hardware needed to run them) while cheaper than before are still too expensive (though getting better with the quest), skepticism still abounds (this has improved a lot in 2019) and AAA titles are not there every month. You also have to remember most people already have a gaming device, so this is also a deterrent in buying yet another gaming device.

We are getting there but it’s going to take a while. Even if we had the perfect HMD we would still be in the chicken and the egg problem. But at lest right now it seems like the chicken is trying to lay the egg where before we didn’t even know if it was a chicken.",Vive
"This post is do disjointed.  So what are you saying?  The mod works and is awesome, or it doesn't work cause its not complete?",Vive
"You might want to pick up a quest instead and get the link cable for it. I love my index. Really the best quality hmd I have ever owned. But the ease of the quest just makes it a very fun hmd to use anywhere. With the link you can also enjoy all those pc games. It’s not as good as the index, but it’s good enough.",Vive
you first!,Vive
"i wrote a guide a while back that should help you.

"I'm completely in the same boat. Dk1, dk2, Vive. First it was awesome with the demos and the potential VR showed. After a couple of weeks the novelty war off and I only started it when family or friends were around as a party gag.

All current content feels like a minor refinement to what is already there. It has been gathering dust for months now. Time to sell and skip 2 generations",Vive
It's terrific in both senses of the word.,Vive
"If it makes you feel better, I had similar tracking issues and since switching to the index, I've probably only had two or three short instances of tracking failure over 2 or 3 hundred hours of in headset time. This is in a large playspace with multiple windows and with pictures and paintings hanging on the wall. I did also purchase a third lighthouse just because I wanted to be sure tracking issues were behind me",Vive
"I bought my Vive headset on eBay  for 100€
And some lighthouse from eBay as well combined with index controllers. I really wanted the index controllers but a full index is really expensive so via eBay I got index controllers and a Vive for 500€ instead of 900€",Vive
"The rotating lasers are present. I've taken pictures with my Huawei P20 Pro camera so you can see for yourself:

"Except it's only going to 72hz and compresses video through the link cable. It looks like a fun device, but not for me. I don't know, might get the Index as I want the best experience.",Vive
[deleted],Vive
"Yeah true, but sometimes convenience and location beat out best experience.

I still use my index (it’s in an unfinished basement) but quest gets more usage due to those 2 things.

Also I do watch 3D moves on the quest and even TV shows when the main tv is being use so there’s that aspect.

Have you used the quest? If not you should try it.  I’ve been doing vr since dk1 (dk2, cv1, vive, index, pimax) and I am very impressed with the experience",Vive
"Index owner since launch. 4 pairs of controllers, 2 headsets and 2 ear speakers all replaced under RMA's..my Vive was bombproof in comparison?.",Vive
"I'm on the second pair of controllers myself, so far so good, but I've heard the wands are the faulty ones, and mine are going strong for more than two years.",Vive

"The thing I'm, as the silly person I am, kind of curious about, from rumors, regards the capabilities of some sort of grabbity *glove*, that Alyx would supposedly wield...

...so if the new game were to take place before HL2, and there is such a device, and it is really powerful; How did we regress from a handy compact wearable, to the front-heavy glowy monstrosity we have previously twice seen poor Alyx struggling to lift? :7",Vive
"Good point, though perhaps it’s because they’re not able to access the same parts and manufacturing resources following the Combine invasion. The Gravity Gun and Dog both look kind of like they’ve been built out of scrap.",Vive
"I have it on an SSD and run an i7 chip, but only 4790k. 😟",Vive
"Yep. Have to assume the fancy glove is lost as some point, and it's back to reassembling the old scrapheap challenge teams... :9

...assuming there is such a glove in the first place, or course.",Vive

"If real, it’s likely that an announcement would include information he doesn’t know about in advance, e.g. a trailer with gameplay footage.",Vive
"I think it's region locked, can't find it either. (Netherlands here)",Vive
"I just spent a few hours playing H3VR, Gunjack, and The Gallery while swapping between the Vive, Rift, and Index. The contrast difference really isn't a substantial difference. Maybe there's something setup wrong on your end?",Vive
"I don't have an Index but I do have a Lenovo which looks great...except for the shadows.  It's substantial and breaks immersion.  Still playable though.

take a look at the Index sub and it pretty much confirms everything.",Vive

I don’t understand why people watch other people playing games. Fair enough for 5 minutes or something to get an idea of if it’s worth buying. But why would you watch someone for a whole day?,Vive
"I don't know if it is true, but I hope so!",Vive
"Question is, have you actually tried?  Watching something like Shroud get insane plays is entertaining.  He often explains his strategy and why he is doing stuff, you learn tricks to play the game better yourself.

Watching TI9 grand finals of Dota 2 can be edge of your seat and shouting at the screen just like any sports.

Sometimes you don't want to have the stress of playing the game, but rather watch someone good excel at it.  Its the same reason sports has been a thing for thousands of years.  We like seeing people at the top of their profession.

Also most people (like me) just have it on their second monitor and aren't watching it at 100% attention.",Vive
"I usually put on streams as on my second monitor while I’m playing games that aren’t dialogue heavy. TV shows and movies require too much of my attention, with a stream I can listen and look over at the most interesting parts. Also, the chat experience is often an entertainment of itself if I do feel like fully focusing myself on a stream. The only thing I could compare the chat experience to is like the difference between watching sports on TV and attending a game in person. There’s feedback from other people watching and a shared experience.",Vive
All the simulator games such as flight and racing sims are some pretty deep content.,Vive
Inside-out tracking has come a long way since it was introduced. I wouldn't disqualify it out of hand. Oculus' implementation is solid. The Cosmos still needs some work.,Vive
"They *literally* lack the hardware, and are generally in line with the last gen, and while sometimes better than might be expected, there is a gulf between them and the RTX cards.

Maybe in a couple of weeks if she hasn't gotten enough hits.,Vive
Please don't buy an OG Vive for the price of a Rift S.,Vive
I typically don't do it myself but I have a couple times. The allure isn't necessarily watching the video game but watching a very entertaining and charismatic person entertaining you who just happens to be playing video games.,Vive
"Ah, region locking.....didnt think about that 

I'm in Ireland, so thas probably why

Thanks for the info guys",Vive
"I hope they don't patch it out like the Devs did with _observer.

Honestly though, I probably won't buy this unless the Devs respond that they're not going to patch the VR camera out, or better yet, that they might add native support.

Anyone tried Vorpx on this?",Vive
"These are good questions you're asking. I had an R9 390 I was continually frustrated by the months and months it would take new VR tech to be implemented. I can't recommend AMD for VR. 

That said, I didn't run into  problems on less intensive games. I think for entry level, basic stuff, that setup is workable.",Vive
"It's entertainment. You usually watch someone that plays really good or is fun to watch, not because of the game.",Vive
"because no one knows what it looks like, how it plays, etc?",Vive
"Sorry the model didn't pan out, but congrats in cutting your losses and learning from the experience. That is a tough thing for lots of people to do. Good luck with your next project, social IS going to be huge in VR, it will explode at some point.",Vive
"You know how in Boneworks and Blade&amp;Sorcery you can pick up swords and guns from a distance by pulling them in? Maybe the gravity gloves do that, where they *only* work with *small* things like guns and tennis balls, where as something like the gravity gun is needed for bigger things like picking up barrels and crates and pushing cars.",Vive
"Personalities, and to watch people play games well that I suck at. Mostly Mario Maker.",Vive
"It's the same appeal as watching sports with commentators, but with video games you get a much wider variety of things for them to talk about.",Vive
"Shorter review: great Pinball game in VR hampered by a lack of future development. The tables available now are probably the last tables you will see. Get it and the expansions on sale if it seems like a good enough value, knowing that you will have to buy a separate game if you want more. Still the tables that are available are great fun, and worth it if you get it on sale if you like pinball.",Vive
"It's kinda sad watching these attempts at something new burn out, but it's good to know you'll be trying again.  I saw the same thing happen with VReal, and I was JUST getting into it when they pulled the plug on it.  

I think part of the problem with these sorts of things is that it's still early in VR's timeline to try to make money with something that will probably depend on a userbase in the millions.  Even if we've got millions of VR users out there now, you won't have all of them interested enough to try it.

I never tried it because it sounded way too personal for me.  I wasn't interested in hanging out with a handful of strangers in someone else's apartment feeding their dog.  It sounds cool and all, but it sounds cool for someone you're close with to me.  

Anyway, good luck with the new project and in a few years when VR becomes ubiquitous maybe you can try this concept again.",Vive
"Could be, could be. We'll see, I guess. :)",Vive
"Yeah but no one cares if *you* don’t know if it’s true, and no one certainly cares that *you* hope it’s true....your feelings, as everyone else’s on the subject (or any subject) are completely irrelevant and have no need to be shared....to anyone...ever.",Vive

"Now I'm happy that I was browsing Reddit instead of getting some sleep, otherwise I wouldn't have stumbled upon this message! I visited your place through the GonzoVR (including feeding Gonzo), and it just *blew my mind* that someone would open up their home to total strangers, even giving them to ability to move around a bit and explore. To me it was a little peek into the VR possibilities of the future :)  


So thank you for your hospitality and your courage to try these sort of projects out. Let's see what is gonna be possible years down the line! Take care.",Vive
"Games that are based off of decision making is often very popular.  For example in a card game you are able to follow along and go ""Well I would do X Y Z"" and then yell at the streamer when he does something better.

Other than that, you can often learn a lot about your favorite game that makes you better at playing it.",Vive
It’s about being entertained by the personality that’s why streamers and you tuber have such a big personality,Vive

Regarding HL2, it can still be played in VR but maybe motion controllers are not working. Last Time I played it was with the DK2 and Razer Hydra controllers.

HL2VR can be played through a VR Mod on Garry's Mod not the best but hey it works! if i remember about this when I get home I'll edit this to contain a link to the mod on the workshop! Its only for stuff that support SteamVR app.,Vive

"&gt; a very entertaining and charismatic person entertaining you who just happens to be playing video games.

Such a person exists on YouTube?",Vive
"This reminds me of My Hero Academia's movie introducing gauntlets that let Deku safely (if temporarily) use 100% of his power with no downside and fail to mention any reason for which Deku couldn't use them again.

Nope.. They are on Twitch  :),Vive
"Very weird, I moved it closer to my PC/linkbox to monitor what was going on and it updated. 

Steps I took: reset warnings, reset usb, reboot all devices, restart update, 3 retries and it worked.

Maybe a bug in the bluetooth firmware? This recent update from what I remember had something to do with power management/bluetooth which might be in line as to why some people report having only one update go through. Pure speculation though.",Vive

Have you tried v4.0.1? It has fixes for motion in a lot of previously problematic setups.,Vive
Just wanted to give you all a quick update for anyone who gives a shit.  the entirety of today trying to fix this garbage and it still is having its stupid tracking issues so i'm switching to an index for sure now.  Thanks for everyone who commented and gave advice but I am defeated and honestly can't even look at it anymore without getting pissed off.,Vive
"Oh, has it been an hour already? People post crap like this about that kid all the damn time.   
Yeah, that sounds fun, sit and watch some guy refreshing his browser all day, just to see his reaction to some piece of news that never comes.    
He's like those doomsday cult preachers. And for some reason, no matter how many predictions don't actually happen, people still obsess over him. It must be the same as trump; nobody in their right mind would call him some kind of godlike chosen one, but all your followers are out of their minds, they just latch on for dear life just to be part of *something*, *anything*, that will let themselves feel important.      
""OMG! The guy on twitch said my username out loud to thank me personally when I donated money to him! I'm special now!""     
A cult of personality is never a good thing. Ever.",Vive
I think they're phasing them out due to cosmos and vive pro being out so probably quite unlikely they'll be restocking,Vive
ray tracing? it doesnt have ray tracing module/chip. It do able to do ray tracing bya DXR tho.,Vive
"There's an HL1VR mod in development that is supposed to have an open beta release very soon.  Has motion controller support, two handed weapons, etc etc  
&amp;nbsp;  
There's also an HL2VR mod in the works but with the pace of development I think you'll be playing HLVR first.  The VR Mod for Garry's Mod is your next best bet",Vive
"plot twist, all those interview scene was made by an AI",Vive
Its perfect for those games.  Even beter if you find one with a deluxe audio strap,Vive
Can you still buy them from the site?,Vive
"Cosmos is a budget system for people who don't want to splash out on Lighthouse-based inside-out tracking.

The non-Lighthouse inside-out tracking used by the Cosmos is notoriously shit.",Vive
"Sorry, not really my department.",Vive
You can buy [certified pre-owned Vive VR systems](https://www.vive.com/us/product/certified-pre-owned/vive/) from HTC's site for $399.,Vive
"For me when I went on there it said they were sold out

Thanks",Vive
"Wow, sorry friend.  I should point out too that they didn't say anything about warranty or whether or not the Deluxe Audio Strap was part of the kit (although it is shown in the picture).

However, it's HTC's legitimate link for purchasing refurbished Vive systems if you at least need a way to return to the manufacturer for defects.after receipt.

I wonder if the location is important too, I just went to the site and added to my cart, it showed as ""In Stock""; I am in the US.",Vive
"This might help.

It looks like the index may be coming to Canada soon

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/dwykus/for\_all\_those\_canadians/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveIndex/comments/dwykus/for_all_those_canadians/)",Vive
"I just went to that link again, went to purchase and it showed in stock.  I hope it's not a case where they only have one item left and I keep blocking you.  Wait 15 minutes and try again, I've removed it from my cart.  :)",Vive
If it’s out of stock or low or something I can always wait,Vive
"If you are looking to not spend too much on intro-level VR, the Vive is great, especially if you can get it at the $399 price with the deluxe audio strap and you already have a PC capable of supporting it.

While I love my Oculus Quest for many reasons, I still love my Vive as well; I did invest in the version 1.0 trackers which still work with my old base stations.

It is not the latest and greatest, but when it came out, it worked with my Nvidia  GTX 970 card.",Vive
I got a very capable pc it’s just I have no clue about VR googles,Vive
"*Hides money bags

Yeah the wireless pro is stupid, get a Facebook face lens",Vive
Nah...worst quality headset on the market but the tracking is good.,Vive
"Tie an elastic band to the usb cable base and band it around the battery, I dance like a lunatic and have never had a disconnection. Once the battery flew out of my back pack and still failed to disconnect. 

Good luck!",Vive
"In that case, you might want to determine what is important for you.  The Oculus Quest, for example, is completely self-contained but is getting a cable to allow it to be tethered to a PC and play Oculus titles with great graphics.

The Vive has similar visuals to the original Oculus Rift, but a different tracking system altogether.  The Vive and Rift are 1st-generation VR HMDs.  WMR (Windows Mixed Reality, Microsoft's lead) headsets like the Lenovo Explorer, Samsung Odyssey (two editions) and the HP (including the newer Reverb) came after.

WMR seems to have fallen by the wayside for consumer VR; Vive, Vive Pro, and Vive Cosmos (in that order from HTC) Oculus Rift and Oculus Rift S (from Oculus) and Valve Index (from Valve) seem to be the pretty much the de-facto consumer-based HMDs that are tethered to a PC.

Aside from the classic phone-holders, the Oculus Go and Oculus Quest are the newest self-contained mobile HMDs (by Oculus) with the Quest being the best offering for it's 6DOF, mobility and decent tracking.

Then there is considering the content.  I could go on a while here, but it's best you do a bit of research and make a more informed decision.",Vive
Get wireless adapter plus galaxy gear mod and you’ll be quite happy trust me,Vive
So I have a capable pc but I’m not in great shape for money like 500 to 600 and the only VR headsets I knew of was Olathe oculus and the vive so this just made things a lot more complicated.,Vive
"Well, you have a capable PC.  Oculus Quest goes for $399 or $499 (same system only different storage capacity).  The Quest will be able to link to the PC for tethered play for better visuals soon.

However, the Quest does have immersive visuals on its own and while you'll need a cell phone (and internet connection) to set it up, it's the most portable solution out there right now.  To be honest, I use my Quest more than my Vive because it's so mobile.

However, if you just want to dedicate one space to play, don't mind being tethered to the PC (perhaps paying for wireless later) and want to spend as little as possible, I'd go for the refurbished Vive.

As the market grows and certain fragments evolve (Oculus had already started with its exclusive content and time exclusives), but Oculus does have some of the best-curated content, while SteamVR has a reasonable amount of shovelware to hit the store.  Fortunately, we're already more than 3-years in and there are some pretty good ratings on established VR content for SteamVR.

I understand the complications; simplest thing, come up with a wishlist of what you want in a VR headset and see which points match what are already out there. :)",Vive
"I'm looking to add a second system for multiplayer and I'm struggling with the choice as well. I love the wireless on my current vive, not sure I wanna go back to wired. Cosmos tracking sucks vs lighthouses, but the pro is way too expensive for not much more of an upgrade. Index seems pricey for no wireless &amp; the controller issues I've seen people report having. Only other consideration is a Rift S, but then no wireless/lesser tracking. 

Considering just getting another used vive for \~300ish &amp; adding on a 2nd wireless unit for a total of 500ish.",Vive
Wise man.  I would think a person who showed any sign of being helpful (even if they scrubbed the toilets) would be bombarded by not only support requests but contempt by dissatisfied customers in general.,Vive
Get the Quest or Rift S depending on if you have ready PC.,Vive
Just get wireless for the vive. The rest are minimal upgrades.,Vive
"You'd be surprised how much disposable income a person has these days, until... they get married... and have kids...",Vive
"People are already complaining about sweating too much into the device.

Potential bodily fluids exuded from facial orifices is certainly going to require one to acquire those silicon gel covers before they can get standard warranty coverage.",Vive
"my god! thk you all. first time in my reddit life that i got a lot of reply ! :D really want to buy that index but i may just upgrade my htc vive and MAYBE put some money for a quest just to bring this for friends house.  i got enough money for that . and one day i will sell everything for that beautiful valve index  ( but here in canada, we still cant buy steam controller or things from valve.  :P )",Vive
"I've played hundreds of hours of VR with the Vive wireless (mostly War Dust)  and I don't notice any problems what so ever with tracking.  There will be the occasional resolution downgrade or compression artifact in the video signal that will happen for a split second, but this isn't a really a problem when playing. The benefit of being completely wireless far outweighs any concern about any subtle performance compromises. 

I'm not going back to a tethered VR experience. 

I'll upgrade only to VR experiences that are wireless.",Vive
"I'm so glad we are at the point we can finally admit Oculus is a good buy in certain situations.
Used to be you would be Downvoted to hell",Vive
"Ya that is weird..I was not claiming under warranty. Purchasing it as extra to share between my family members, sharing sweat sucks haha.  


Maybe it to prevent people from buying wrong facepads like the reply above...hope it's not some policy where one HMD cannot buy more than one facepad, etc...that will be stupid.",Vive
"Hmm, hopefully that is their intention.",Vive
what,Vive
not like the Index grey blacks.  You haven't seen grey blacks until you've used LCD.  It looks so fake that almost breaks immersion.,Vive
He talks a good game.,Vive
"I have an oculus and enjoy it, but there are no trackers for the thing",Vive
"HTC VIVE PRO ALL THE WAY!!! It’s so much better it’s not even funny.
The index is garbage anyways, you won’t be able to stand how washed out and shitty blacks it has, be glad you can’t but it.
I recently got the Vive Pro, and at native resolution is AMAZING!
That’s all.",Vive
"This is no starter vr,  this is a finisher vr!!  


Still rocking OG vive.",Vive
"HELL YEAH!!! Just got mine, it’s so much better it’s not even funny!!",Vive
LCD is garbage for VR... end of story.,Vive
You can link your phone in the vive port program.   Don't know if that was what you were using before.,Vive
Hell yeah!!,Vive
Not until you try the Vive Pro. It’s a huge difference.,Vive
yeah I've been rocking the Vive Pro for about 8 months now.  It's almost perfect.,Vive
The OG Vive is excellent for military games.  The most important thing is perfect tracking.,Vive
"If this were an email I’d received, I would have assumed it was a phishing scam.",Vive
"I reallllyyyy wouldn't say worst quality on the market... at all. It has far better quality than over half the VRs on the market right now, with only the currently big three companies (playstation, Vive, Oculus) matching or surpassing it.",Vive
"Hello, everyone! In an effort to make boss fights more rewarding in [the game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/755410/Vengeful_Rites/), we've added a new type of equipment that can only be crafted with boss rewards. We've also added a quick slot belt for faster access to a couple of items so you don't have to always go into your backpack for something that you might want to use quickly. If you'd like to keep up with development and provide feedback to help us improve the game, you can do so in our [discord](https://discord.gg/zvZdAAQ). Thanks for watching!",Vive
"It really hasn’t, screen and lenses are worse than RiFt, WMR and PSVR. Comfort is crap too.",Vive
"I have lots of very thick, fine hair, and the deluxe audio strap only makes that aspect of the discomfort worse, and I need lens inserts because wearing glasses in one sucks, but I still find it more comfortable than an Oculus.",Vive
"The Vive is fine, but they don't make them any more so finding one may not be easy.",Vive
"Cool update. When I tried the demo it was a lot of fun, I did find the backpack system super annoying though. Glad to see that is now improved. 

It does seem like the rings are a bit hard to see right now. Adding a subtile glow effect or immissive texture would help a lot I think. 

Keep up the good work!",Vive
"Having owned the Vive (And loved it) owning the Index (And hating it) I now own a Vive Pro (And love it). The fit is much improved with the deluxe audio strap. I'd consider going to Vive Pro if you want an upgrade, but I'm an OLED snob so my options are limited. (Found that out when I played Elite in the Index..)",Vive
it's easy to find.  They sold them worldwide so countries where VR is not popular still have a ton of them.,Vive
"&gt; Vive Pro

I have a Vive Pro. I really like it, but I have been intrigued by descriptions of the latest Pimax release. The extra FOV sounds pretty game changing, IMO.",Vive
"Thanks! Yeah the current bands are very likely placeholders. We'll be improving the look of them over time, probably having them change based on the type of gem placed in them as well to better reflect their benefits. :)",Vive
Get the Vive Pro with wireless!,Vive
"Thought I checked there initially but obviously not well enough! The games are there now, thanks for that 😊",Vive
The rift s is a huge step up from the first rift. That USB tracking solution sucked.,Vive
This seems so niche i doubt it would happen,Vive
"AFAIK if you install just Viveport it doesn't install the extras for individual headsets. You have to go to settings and select ""Set up a Device"". With the Cosmos it downloads and installs a lot of things that are needed for the Cosmos to function one of which is the Vive Console which has a blue Vive icon in the taskbar.

In the settings you will also find an option to ""Set up a Phone"". Try it first but you might have to first setup the Vive to download required software.",Vive
"if you place it on your desk somewhere, or somewhere that it wont have any hot air blowing on it, or somewhere exposed to air (like on your desk) you should be fine, ive played 5+ hour sessions snd not had too much problem",Vive
"If u are getting a rift s , please try it on before u buy since it don't have an IPD adjustment.  


If lucky u might like it.  


If u are unlucky (like me with an IPD of 71.5) the rift S gave me eyestrain within 10 minutes of usage where the VIVE can last me for hours.",Vive
Almost every multiplayer game could make use of it,Vive
"At least if you got a Vive Pro, you could still use your steam library.. it's pretty sweet if you can afford it.",Vive
her vision is the problem. she needs to either wear contacts or you can get prescription lenses to insert into the headset itself.,Vive
"Dang, I was worried that might be the case. Thanks for the tip.",Vive
i wear my glasses in VR,Vive
Maybe. But even then I cant imagine most people would be willing to spend. Money to just track lips.,Vive
"you know that Carmack is looking at this and saying ""hmm, maybe I should get my AI chops up...""",Vive
I'm not sure what the problem would be unless it's her glasses. I have just mine with glasses without any problem and I have a fairly strong prescription.,Vive
"The cosmos would give youa much better resolution, but there have been some complaints about the tracking. I have heard good things about their last updates for the tracking, especially with the wireless attachment. Wireless atachment and audio strap are worth it, perhaps wait for black friday sales if considering some upgrades.     
       
The wands can be awkward for some games, im waiting for the knuckles to ship to Canada as well, they seem better than the new cosmos controllers.   Hopefully they start to do so soon, shouldnt take them this long to sort out a delivery system through a carrier.",Vive
You can adjust the headset so the lenses are farther away from her face so her glasses won't scratch them.,Vive
I'd say your friend needs new glasses. Or reading glasses.,Vive
"Have you tried voicemeeter? You can install it, set it as your default audio device and set your normal audio device in voicemeeter, example [here](https://i.imgur.com/2CmW3xg.png). That way, if the Vive dies, the default audio device will still be voicemeeter, so you just need to set your device in voicemeeter. It works great for me.",Vive
"Hers a prescription lenses. She can see fine with them on, just not in VR.",Vive
"&gt; Where the fuck do you get all that money?

Works for HTC, so probably gets at below retail cost",Vive
Why can't she wear them while using the headset?,Vive
"I‘m using my wireless Vive for art design nowadays and can’t say that tracking changed under it. It‘s still vulnerable to windows and I need to cover the big mirror, but I‘m also two years behind with firmware upgrades I guess.",Vive
"I own several VR HMD and rank them like this:

1. Valve Index
2. Oculus Rift S
3. HTC Vive (Wireless)
4.  Samsung Odyssey+

I haven't used my wireless Vive since getting the Rift S them the Index, once back in stock. The visual upgrade for me it's enough to prefer it over the wireless Vive.  Others my not feel the same, but the visual upgrade is worth giving up wireless for me. 

Here's hoping the Index and Rift S get a wireless option in the near future. I can dream right?",Vive
"Yup, one of my friends is blind as a bat, when he used my headset I would just put the lenses out a couple notches so his glasses would clear and he was good to go. Might still be an issue if the glasses have thick frames though.",Vive
"She does, the problem is that the vive is blurry for her no matter what we change in the headset.",Vive
"You left a later comment saying she already wears glasses in the headset, but here you imply she doesn't. 

Which is it?",Vive
"I implied no such thing, you incorrectly inferred that. The previous poster simply mentioned she would either need to wear contact lenses or get prescription lens inserts. Hence why I said I thought that may be the case (the special lens sets, which wouldn't be worth it given she'd only be using it occasionally when she visits.",Vive
"So first of all, can see clearly up to to 2m away IRL ? if she can she doesn't need to wear glasses in the HMD.

Secondly, the lenses are made with a circular sweetspot (where is it clear) at the center. So having the top part blurry would mean the sweetspot is too low, try finding the right position without using the strap first. You have to know that the sweetspot is pretty small, you have to find the right position by looking straight, and finding the edges of the blurriness, for example if when you look straight the upper middle part is blurry, move the headset up until you find the lower middle part blurriness and then get in the middle of these, you can do the same for the IPD, but it is way more subtle... so i would suggest measuring it)

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, there is a possibility that what your friend perceive as ""blurry"" is just the natural resolution of the HMD. The sweetpost is not 4K clear, especially if you try to look at things close to your face.. to find the sweetspot i usually use the bright chaperone boundary lines",Vive
Stupid question: Are they transition lenses/modern bifocals? How strong is the prescription? I found when ordering custom lenses for my Vive to retrofit that -4 was the highest prescription offered. I have-3.75. Even with the prescription lenses I get a little blur at the very outer edges. It’s still more comfortable than glasses for long-term use.,Vive
You had been playing for 9 hours straight?? Jesus Christ that's some dedication!,Vive
"To my knowledge there wasn't a deal on the original vive last year at $499, so I would make a guess they won't lower the price on a refurbished one. Other retailers might give some slight discounts on other newer headsets, but again, this is just a guess.",Vive

Your definition of ""human rights"" is arbitrary and highly opinable. Every country has the right to keep illegal immigrants outside.",Vive
"Yes, that's a good summary of the above comment.",Vive
"Had a free day off work and tons of fun in VRChat.

...i mean, can you blame me? Lol",Vive
"I had a day off from work and had tons of fun in VRChat.

....i mean, can you blame me?",Vive
Lens swap. Really. It’s awesome. I just don’t use my vive anymore because I have random tracking issues,Vive
nice looks very good.  nice sound fx too.,Vive
"I'd have said the sound needs a bit of work, but I'm loving how much it's looking like Gmod VR. It's amazing to me that it's not already happened. But yeah with the amount of hours I could spend in Gmod building contraptions if this is similar those clanging noises would get old quick.",Vive
"While objects in VR may appear closer, the images generated by the goggles lenses and screens are effectively projected a few meters away.  The apparent distance is achieved by having different images for each eye.  The user does not need to accommodate their eyes to different distances as one does in natural scenes.

This means that, if the user is nearsighted, he/she has to use their corrective lenses to be able to accommodate to a distance of a few meters.  This also means that one does not need reading glasses to see ""near"" objects in VR since, optically, they are not near.

I am unsure if this is what is being asked.  I certainly need to wear my glasses inside the headset.  I have not have much of an issue with this.  I hope you can solve problem.  Good luck!",Vive
"Yeah, but screen, colours, SDE and lenses are worse.",Vive
"Yeah the sensitivity need to be tuned, and i forgot an exepermental setting that changes the pitch based on how hard a prop hits a surface on too. But will do!",Vive
"Love it, we really need a Garry's mod for VR",Vive
And will be coming to steam with workshop support for props/maps!,Vive
"I love physics sandbox shenanigans like this.

Does it have sort of a time scale slider? In games like this, i sometimes use cheat engine to slow the game down. Due to how steam vr works, that lets me interact with the world as if im the flash moving at super speed. Amplifying the force and speed of my interactions with the game, relative to how much i've slowed it down. Its great fun.

So does this game now, or will it have a time scale setting?",Vive
"Huh good idea, I'll throw in a setting that allows for that tomorrow!",Vive
Neat!,Vive
Looking forward to it!!,Vive
Do you know of a place to get those perscription inserts?,Vive
"Hmm if I were you I'd wait till I could get the index (I'm going under the assumption that Canada will get it soon but I'm not sure, there may be info I don't know about). I was going to pick that up (UK) when it dropped in price a bit but I got a deal on a Vive I couldn't resist so am using that until my eventual upgrade. (I live in the UK and I got it at a US price which is why the deal was so good for me). Either way I think the index is the way to go, not only is everything just improved in general but man, those controllers. They make me tempted to just wait for boneworks even tho it looks so good just because of full knuckles support, maybe even an upgrade to those controllers before you get the full kit would be the most viable upgrade? If that's even possible. I say this because it seems there aren't to many straight up upgrades (a few compromises though) aside from the index (I mean I guess the Vive pro is but that's not even a a massive upgrade) so it seems there aren't many logical upgrades. Maybe the deluxe audio strap could help your experience (I love mine). The wireless upgrade also sounds nice (and I'm wireless crazy about most things) but I don't think it's personally worth the extreme cost (maybe it's not too bad in Canada?)",Vive
Really cool game keep up the good work!,Vive
"I'm still rocking the OG Vive, though I'm thinking about getting an Index.",Vive
"Tried the quest yesterday (as someone that returned his cosmos due to uncorrectable facial misplacement)

And I must say that the visual quality almost almost as good, I can barely see the difference and the quest is clear from edge to edge. Also I had concerns about the refresh rate as someone who watch films in 60fps. Same thing, hard to see the difference. Tracking is also 100% better. 

There is no doubt to me now, get the quest with the pc cable.",Vive
Interesting note the 8350 fx cpu still holds the world record for overclocking. Since 2012,Vive
"In terms of the most played gamemodes Pavlov has prophunt, various TTT maps, and a crappy zombie mode that's fun in short bursts. But it's primarily a FPS and it shows.

This game looks pretty neat, hope it takes off.",Vive
"Yeah, I enjoyed those game modes from time to time but it was really the building that got me hooked on Gmod.",Vive
"I am nearsighted and have to wear my glasses for the OG Vive and for the Rift CV-1.  However, I don't need them when I use the Vive Pro.    Each of the HMDs project to a different focal point and the focal distance of the Pro appears to be closer than that of the Rift.",Vive
Oh man that'd be cool! Quite the challenge too,Vive
"This is really cool! Keep working on it, I think it'll be really cool. Best of luck!",Vive
"Thanks for the support, I'll be making detailed guides in how to make custom props and maps.

If this game takes off it will be the community content around it that will make it possible.",Vive
but oculus quest with cable link is something like that ...not?,Vive
im surprise . i got a quest ....with thoses good controllers i was thinking i will hate my wands but i still like them for the feeling to hold something..like a sword or a gun.. weird! i love them both actually :P  ( touch controller and wand htc vive),Vive
Sorry mate didnt watch but I wonder why is a bigger part of your setup guide literally just you either speaking to camera or dancing,Vive
Go to controller bindings. Advanced Settings adds a bunch of extra actions to the available list.,Vive
"Yes, kinda. But it it won't be as good for PC VR than the Rift S which has native PCVR support. It might be closer enough to not really matter for most people, but we won't know for sure until it actually and we can try it on various games.

Oculus Link renders everything on the PC at a lower resolution than the Native Quest screen, foveates the image, compressed it, them seems it to the Quest to be decompressed. There is a cost to this process:

1. latency
2. A softer image

Again, may or may not make a meaningful difference. Some fast actions games may not perform as well.

If I'm playing PCVR, personally I'd rather use a Rift S, especially if I can get one for $350 over Black Friday/the holidays. If portability is important to you, then the Quest might be you choice.

I also have a Quest, and like it. I do like my Rift S and Index better.",Vive
"I love the look of this game, it seems better than modbox and seems less finikey to work with!

How about destructible object gun, where you shoot it and it becomes destructible so you can break it",Vive
"It seems good and I like the physics, but there was literally nothing to do in it but spawn some blocks and spin them around.",Vive
"These things, they take time.

Plus I'm working on the fundamental toolguns, fun and interesting props + thrusters will come sooner than later.

Plus you can always make your own, that's a big part of the whole concept.",Vive
"Some quick clips of the new breaching charges in Crunch Element. I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback!

**Propaganda:**

&gt;Crunch Element is a physics-centered VR infiltration game where the player can  siege compounds in whatever play style suits them. Whether that’s scaling walls quietly with a suppressed pistol taking the roof entrance, or using a breaching charge as a hole-puncher-for-walls with a  sawed-off on the hip, Crunch Element’s goal is to give the player as much freedom as possible and allow them to express themselves through  whatever play style suits them. Many of these play styles are complemented by the flagship mechanic of destructible walls, doors, and  floors. My goal is to include the community in the development process as much as possible by allowing early hands-on testing and considering  player feedback at every step of the way.

You need some mods. Vanilla weapons are boring.,Vive
Nope,Vive
Not here,Vive
My only dig on pistol whip is that there are times when you should be shooting enemies for full points where there is no beat.  It’s off putting to say the least.  In this case a good example is the spawn of three guys up top at the beginning.,Vive

Yes! But not at launch..,Vive
Aww bless her :) watch out guys she will be a pro in the future!!,Vive
:),Vive
Launch it today.,Vive
"Beat saber is very very exercise-y!! I sweat so much when I play and get out of breath. You can also download mods for a calorie counter to see exactly what you have burnt. I would deffo recommend, its my faviourite VR game going. Its something you can play for ages while getting a good work out. :)",Vive

[Vive display isn't working](/r/Vive/comments/dx9tne/vive_display_isnt_working/) by  LtGray6


 I could use some help here - I've been using the Vive for 2 months and it's been fine, no issues (or very minor easy ones), but then all of a sudden, the inner display in the headset stopped working. Everything else works, the tracking, the LEDs are all green, and the display mirror on the PC shows it's moving, tracking with no issues. I just can't see anything in the headset, it's black.  


Do you think its the HDMI inside of the headset?

I also wear my glasses inside my VIVE. You can buy a cheap pair of prescription glasses from a website called zenni.,Vive
"I just saw that multiplayer isn't i yet. I think that's like the #1 thing this needs before launch. Other than that, the community can make the rest of the assets.",Vive
man i didnt realise Open VR had push to talk. There's so many reasons to want to mute your mic temporarily it suprises me that no headsets seem to have a physical button.,Vive
"Well you aren't wrong, multiplayer is a must for sure.

However since it isn't free to rent servers, I can't afford it at launch if I where to make the game free at least in the start.

So most likely the code will be in the game, but won't work at least until I get some revenue from the game..",Vive
Respekt my bruh,Vive

[PC For Wireless Without Black Screens](/r/Vive/comments/dxa1sr/pc_for_wireless_without_black_screens/) by  krogenit


Hello. I have issues with black screens on my system: Vive Pro, MSI Z370 Gaming Plus, i7 8700k, 32 gb 3200mhz, Thermaltake TR2 700W 80+ Bronze, 1080ti. I readed a lot threads with that problem and i think PC with Ryzen will works better or AMD users have black screens too? Also i think that black screens on Vive less frequently as on Vive Pro. So i'm asking Vive Pro users.

If you playing wireless without black screens completely at all, i just want to know what's you PC components, mobo, cpu and psu?

 I have fan on the top of adapter and i'm using new USB cable for connecting adapter to powerbank. I tried everything except different PC and maybe my power supply not powerful enough.

Yea.. you get full points cuz there’s no beat and only scored for accuracy.. but there not just gonna put no enemies lol,Vive
"Interesting, I'll have a look at that!",Vive
Highly unlikely,Vive
"For what it's worth i literally only play my Vive with glasses on at this point because I'm too lazy to put in my contacts. There's no good reason it should be blurry, it makes me wonder if she is just expecting crystal clear and the fact is VR is not crystal clear. Perhaps her glasses are jammed up against the lenses or are otherwise being offset when the headset goes on? You can bump the lenses farther away from your face a couple notches to possibly help with that.",Vive
this looks incredible! im joining the discord!,Vive
I'd consider getting the Blaster for the game but it needs to be supported straight from the box. And it needs custom songs too.,Vive
Looks like the dude is a big fan of himself.,Vive

Apparently pillars and enemies are generetaed using the audio rather than beeing hard-coded",Vive
Huh. I’ve never heard of voice someter. So it will work with the deluxe audio head strap?,Vive
I’m rubbing the game through Mod Organizer with over 200 mods. So it takes a bit longer to reboot for me.,Vive
Yikes. I wonder why.,Vive
"That’s ridiculous that HTC would sell a not so cheap device with such a cheap port. People love to complain about Apple products, but the one issue I’ve never have with them is cheap hardware.",Vive

Well that's interesting.,Vive
okay,Vive
"Check out this website, you can compare tons of GPU's

"That is the fall on normal. No way it can be “generated by audio”. That’s like saying beat saber can do that. This game is gonna be hard to be actual good custom levels because of the leveling systems, how it’s not just an open plane but a specific set that correlated to the song.",Vive
"there are a ton of online stores that sell them. first you'll need an adapter for the lenses and then lenses themselves. it's rather expensive for what it is, but if you can't or hate wearing glasses in VR it may be worth it to you. VROptician is one such example of the lenses.",Vive
"My RTX 2060 I got last month is doing pretty well with beat Saber, Arizona Sunshine, and even some high power simulations like Universe Sandbox^2.",Vive
Isn’t that what ModBox is?  I haven’t booted that up since it launched so not sure...,Vive

Recent AMD cards (5700 series) have issues with some UE4 based games, dunno about older AMD GPU's tho. Maybe AMD will fix their crappy drivers eventually, maybe not, so I don't recommend AMD cards for VR.  
Bought 5700xt, had to return it and now I'm using 1080 with vive pro (same specs as Index in terms of resolution), works fine in with almost any game.",Vive

Uh.,Vive
"The program I used was installed with the Vive HMD setup software Viveport was not necessary to have at all.

No it was part of the HMD setup software &amp; was available regardless of whether I installed Viveport as well. The main thing I need is the audio boost function and I don't think you can do that through Viveport to my knowledge.,Vive
"Yea you know its at least irritating when someone who doesnt have much to say wouldnt shut up  


Not to mention you are really mistaking self confidence with egocentrism",Vive
"I've been out of the loop on the GPU scene so pardon my question - are the 5700 XT driver issues present with pancake non-VR UE4 games? What are those issues exactly?

The /r/amd sub also seems disappointed with the 5700 XT driver situation for similar reasons but folks there seem divisive about the issues.",Vive
Ego centrism? Jesus the guys tryna make a good YouTube video that increases watch time and succeeded from an editing standpoint,Vive
"The bad reviews put me off a bit. Is it possible to customize the physics to some degree? (eg.: in Eleven, I feel like I have to swing like a wuss to keep the ball from launching into outer space)

As a side note, never expected to hear KPop music instrumentals in a trailer video for a ping pong VR game..

"Than anything else on the market? Definitely not. Than most of the other headsets released by major VR developers, such as Vive, Oculus, and Playstation? Yeah, for the most part.",Vive
"Some recent flatscreen games worked fine for me (Forza Horizon 4, Gears5). I think that AMD applying fixes for flatscreen games ASAP and looks like they doesn't care about VR so much.  
With early Radeon driver versions UE4 VR games was crashing so hard, that my PC was stuck with blank screen until reboot. With later driver update there is no blank screen, only crashing.",Vive
What algorithm and how does it pick up dancing in the videos?,Vive
It's a program you install on windows https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/index.htm,Vive
"the idea is that more watch time on a video makes youtube reccommend your video more, hes padding here but in a pretty entertaining way. he doesnt get straight to the point for a reason.. which is more views",Vive
"&gt; The bad reviews put me off a bit. Is it possible to customize the physics to some degree? (eg.: in Eleven, I feel like I have to swing like a wuss to keep the ball from launching into outer space)

It's possible to customize it in Eleven by changing the bounciness of the racket.",Vive
"No seriously, which are worse?

The cheapest WMR headsets maybe, but those are very few.",Vive
"Virtually all VR headsets not made by those three companies, honestly. For instance, there's a lot on the Chinese market that are really, really horrible.",Vive
its pretty fun in Arizona sunshine as well,Vive
"Finally got to try it. He started in vr, I swapped in and made good progress with me there. Fun game. We got to I think level 12 before he had to go.",Vive
I went from a 970 to 1660 ti and I'm happy with it,Vive
Any 1080Ti cheaper than a new 2070 Super is a good deal.,Vive
"The idea isn’t dancing, it’s that he added the dancing as filler so you stay on the video longer and either watch it or skip through to the point. Either way your in the video longer than if he were to just get straight to the point without the dancing",Vive
"Lol ok man...and those turkish and arab ones....come on, let’s keep the discussion reasonable.",Vive
Yeah man... for real...,Vive
I'll be back...,Vive
He thinks his mclaren pro is better than my pro,Vive
"It is a reasonable discussion. These are prominent VR models on the market. Unless you want to limit the discussion to exclusively those three companies, in which case you're not really... saying anything at all.",Vive
I'll post a video of where it's at now,Vive
If he doesnt get straight to the point on GUIDE video it makes it a VERY FUCKING BAD GUIDE VIDEO,Vive
Don't. It doesn't accurately reflect gaming/VR performance.,Vive
I strongly disagree as a YouTube creator myself this is a very well made video,Vive
"Here's a vid of what it looks like right now
https://youtu.be/1hf2XSHyeU8",Vive
"&gt;This also means that one does not need reading glasses to see ""near"" objects in VR since, optically, they are not near.

&gt;I am unsure if this is what is being asked. I certainly need to wear my glasses inside the headset. I have not have much of an issue with this. I hope you can solve problem. Good luck!

Thank you, this was the answer. She tried without her glasses and she could see and had a blast. I hadn't even thought of trying without them tbh.",Vive
"Get the GTX1660TI. It is comparable with the GTX1070, except it is newer, in the same price range and contain various new features for VR and non-VR titles due to the tuning architecture, such as ray-tracing.",Vive
"1. configure the bindings. the easiest way to do this is to at main page click the ""bindings"" above the ""settings"" button.
2. PTT is in the ""Misc"" actiongroup (tabs at top)
3. make sure in Advanced Settings you have the ptt checkbox enabled, if you want it as push-to mute instead you need to have ptt and push-to-mute both enabled",Vive

"I guess I'm not 100% sure what you're after because you can physically walk in any standing or roomscale game and only need to rely on artificial locomotion if you run out of room...

Do you mean games that just keep the play area within approx 5'x5' and have no artificial locomotion?

Look up Tea for God. It allows you to walk around seemingly large areas while keeping you contained in your play space.",Vive
Whats the one game?,Vive
"yeah without artificial locomition, I'm just wanting to know if its being developed more now. And thanks I'll have a look",Vive
What is the one game,Vive
"I've been searching all night and i cant find it, I think I saw it in a CES Video",Vive
"Look up Unseen Diplomacy. It is a short, procedurally generated, replayable secret agent game. It uses a really cool mechanic where as you walk around your space it changes behind walls.

You do need a fairly large space however.",Vive
"It seems most games aren't heading in that direction currently, but hopefully the techniques used in Tea for God do get put to more use eventually.

I recall some older games don't use artificial locomotion. When I played them years later it seemed like a dated gameplay mechanic (or lack thereof). One that comes to mind is Accounting. IIRC the set changes but it's always a smallish area forcing you to walk around it.",Vive
woooow...great finding!! how is this possible?,Vive
How much room do you have?,Vive
Fast and Low,Vive
"Noooo, don’t used compressed air. If you can, work in a room that has little dust (no carpet etc.) and try to do the mod with the headset upside down so that any dust around doesn’t fall in. If you do happen to get any dust in there, just try a rocket blower that they use for camera sensors (rubber hand power bellows) at most. Don’t want to cause additional issues with compressed air :-). But as long as you are careful, you should be fine!",Vive
Hahaaa lol.  Definitely not like Oculus Subreddit.  Shame,Vive
"That’s the promise they give every tech lead or person who loves coding once they get a lead position. Then you get a few more meetings. Then you gotta do hiring. Eventually that 50% shrinks to 30, then 20, then you can’t do your lead job effectively and people are paying you to stop. It’s just what happens.",Vive
After getting a business degree I went into coding because I wanted to do things instead of manage. Now 5 years later I’m a senior dev and my next path up means I’m right back to managing. A lot of people who love to code switch between senior and lead because they want to make more money but they also want to code. Happens all the time in tech.,Vive
i bought it used on ebay from a very reputable seller.,Vive
everybody moved to r/vive_vr,Vive
Everybody...there are 77 people there right now.,Vive
Because there are about 77 butthurt crybabies who come here strictly to downvote everything.,Vive
Ouch. Sounds frustrating,Vive
"&gt;""leaves to work on a hobby AGI project that he has never really expressed interest in before""  
&gt;  
&gt;he said in that same jre episode that agi is potentially only 10 years away if the right amount of effort is put in trying to achieve that. he must have seen some sort of coding problem that he believes he could solve, and to be honest the prospect of a real ""AGI"" is way more lucrative than vr.",Vive
"&gt; Facebook's stated goal is to have ""1 billion people using their VR"". At it's current pace, the Quest will only take a 1000 years to get there. See where expectations and reality have a little of a disconnect here? 

I think this is a bit unfair. Adoption of new tech is never linear.",Vive
"hey, you take that back!

it is at least succinct and informative.",Vive
"And half the posts on the front page is just a bot linking back to popular threads on this sub.

lmao",Vive
Perhaps he could now continute working on VR at Valve? Bring back Abrash with him?,Vive
"According to *The History Of The Future*, Carmark joined because of GearVR.

IIRC basically all his Oculus Connect talks have centred on Oculus's mobile hardware, and that's what he really seems to care about.

I'm pretty sure he's never really been working on PCVR.",Vive
Next: Duck and weave,Vive
That worked! Thank you so much!,Vive
"As someone who owns (and has fairly extensively used) both, I'd recommend you get the Rift S, with a couple of exceptions:

* The Vive can handle unusual IPDs much better than the Rift S - if you're IPD is within range it'll be fine, but if not that will be a problem.
* If you intend to (within, say, six months) upgrade to the Valve Index you should get a Vive - though IMO if you want and can afford the Index just get that.

The Vive was an *excellent* system back in 2016. It's been three years, and I cannot reasonably say the same thing about it now.

Keep in mind that HTC has actually discontinuted it, and is no longer producing the original Vive (the Vive Pro is still in production though).

Every modern headset - the Valve Index, Oculus Quest and Rift S, HTC Vive Cosmos, HP Reverb and Samsung Odyssey offer **far** superior image quality.

This is not a minor issue; the lower SDE and higher pixel density make text which was almost impossible to read on the Vive easily legible.",Vive
"He may have a mortal lifespan, but he's no mortal.",Vive
Serious answer? The Vive community splitted up some time ago and the Vive itself isn't that popular anymore.,Vive
I think I will try and buy one. I don't have any other choice anyway.,Vive
We need certain GPU power for the ray casting therefore this would not work on mobiles,Vive
"Yeah it's sad.  I got a PM from one of their bots 

""Hey! we noticed that you made a popular post on /r/vive.  We would love for you to make the same kind of high quality post on the vive_vr subreddit...""",Vive
whenever an application is used medical you need an approval of the particular county. with the new medical device regulation this is quite strict even an app on a mobile counting steps would be a medical aplication.,Vive
There are millions of PC gamers with a capable PC who don't have VR.  More anectodal evidence but I would have to imagine those will will be the largest group of potential adopters...people who are already gamers.,Vive
"I'm very interested in this game I hope to see more levels and dungeons, etc.  seems like that is what's missing.",Vive
I don't know what I did but it's working now. I Was restarting closing all related apps. Thanks for the help anyways,Vive
Do you want to manage again or do you enjoy coding more?,Vive
I guess you could use that hole to put your penis in.,Vive
I also have the Cosmos wireless kit.  It should work fine with your Vive Pro.  You may just need to use a little extra velcro strapping to fix it to your pro rear top headstrap.  Should be pretty easy to figure this out imho.,Vive
"Understandable, I couldnt get the valve because of the tracking boxes unfortunately otherwise I would have taken them too.",Vive
"Oled is why i might keep my rift pro over the index. The blacks are amazing. Also I am sure you know this but you could use revive for the Oculus store with a Oled vive pro lol.  But I am happy to hear you are enjoying your cosmos :D. Just curious, what do you have against lighthouses?",Vive
"Nothing really against them, or even my Rift cv1 sensors.  I just prefer inside out for its simplicity.",Vive
"A lot of people were banned, including devs (for self promotion). I think the mod added too many rules and got ban happy.",Vive
"Yes, there is. But it costs more than the game itself. Even though I own Thief Simulator.

If you open the lid of the haptic motor you'll see 2 wires. These are the 2 wires you solder on to,Vive
"This is the same guy who did Unedited Video of a Bear, House with People In it, and Alanturorial",Vive
"no, it can't, as the radios necessary are inside your vive, not the link box. the link box contains a bluetooth 4.0 (ble) radio that communicates with the base stations for power and firmware updates. as the index doesn't use a link box, the hmd itself has this ble radio, as well as the 2 nrf24 radios for tracked devices like controllers.",Vive
"search this subreddit, there's a couple posts a week about this.",Vive
i bloody hate the vast majority of memes and videos. most are nothing but a plea of ”give me attention” from someone who doesn't actually have anything to say.,Vive
No. I can’t imagine it would. It’s just a conduit to split and extend the power/data. It also contains Bluetooth to communicate with the base stations. That’s it. The link boxes are surprisingly simple.,Vive
Ah ok thanks.,Vive
"it also contains an active hdmi and usb repeater/redriver, as well as a mdp-&gt;hdmi converter, power regulator, and the bluetooth radio you mention.


yes, it can overheat, and signal timing will likely get screwed and cause tracking or video issues before damage occurs. i haven't any idea about what temperature it overheats, though.",Vive
"Hmm ok, so far I have no issue with tracking or anything else for months at the same place..nvm I just move it away to be safe...thanks",Vive
"the vive has been discontinued.


if you have a good computer, with a gtx 1080ti class gpu, i'd recommend getting valve's index kit.


if you absolutely need wireless and don't mind a loss in clarity, you can get a vive pro kit, an htc wireless kit, and the wireless vive pro adapter kit, although you will need a free pcie slot and a 6-8 core fast cpu as well as a gtx 1080/ti class gpu.",Vive
"I was gonna say, seems like punching with the controller n hand could easily lead to injury. Still, it’s really awesome what you’ve achieved",Vive
"Year ago when the VR headsets first came out, there were some good memes. Anyone remember the Palmer Luckey / Rift train going off the rails and Gabe saving it with the Vive?",Vive

I bought a HTC vive on eBay (only the headset)
I plan on using Lighthouse stations with the steam index controlers I don't have the base stations jet
So I connected the vive to my PC and started steam vr the head set screen then goes white is this normal or is my head set Dead on Arrival
To be clear I don't have controls or base stations

"&gt; Lol ok you dont have to outsell everyone to get AAA games. 

You don't have to outsell them, but you have to get close. Just look at the Wii, sold like 100 million units and still never managed to attract solid third party support.

AAA games are being made right now. What you wrote is bs",Vive
"The issue isn't so much that Quest isn't attracting those numbers right now, but that nobody has figured out what would actually attract those numbers. It's simply not clear what problem VR has to solve to be attractive to that many people. It's not even clear what VR has to do to attract the average PC gamer.

Making the graphics better and the device cheaper can't hurt, but are those actually the problems that stop people doing VR? DK1 got everybody hyped up with 720p 3DOF, so why hasn't the vastly superior and vastly cheaper $130 WMR been sold out already?",Vive
"My original Vive is a trooper, but it's definitely showing it's age. The only reason to get a Vive or Vive Pro right now is for wireless or if you just get an absolutely amazing deal on a used set.

Since it's discontinued you're going to be on your own for repairs and replacement parts, so expect zero support from HTC.

At this point any of the newer gen headsets are going to be better if you're sticking with wired setup, and I'm even including the Cosmos there.

I love my Vive (non Pro) but the resolution really does suck compared to even Windows WMR sets. As soon as the Index gets any kind of wireless solution I'll be upgrading.",Vive

"&gt; but that nobody has figured out what would actually attract those numbers.

I think we have a pretty clear idea: VR needs to fullfill some core role in our everyday lives. Gaming is mostly just about entertainment, while I can see a successful VR game pulling in millions of players in another generation of hardware or two, I believe there's still a large market outside of games that'll slowly but surely adopt VR too. It is the ultimate tool for telepresence. What if you combine this with streaming of live light-field video capture? People could be present at events, meetings, and whatnot that are at the other side of the planet.

The steps we need to make with the hardware and technology are actually quite simple in concept, but will require years and years of engineering and design work.",Vive

It uses advanced quantum entanglement cooling, so even if you were to fire it directly into the sun, every atom in the device will radiate its heat through a wormhole and into the hydrogen ice core of a planet orbiting PA-99-N2 in the Andromeda galaxy.

Pimax all but took over the vive sub for awhile, and alot of vive users didnt like it and started downvoting any Pimax thread till they made their own subreddit.

And you must get some vive lighthouses for tracking. Dont buy the kighthouses from Pimax just yet. They cant deliver due to supply issues.

&gt; **SWORDS of GARGANTUA Announces Adventure Mode Tesseract Abyss, Coming December 5**  
   
**TOKYO - November 14, 2019 -** gumi inc., and Yomuneco Inc. have announced the release date and details for the next update to VR online arena-combat action game “SWORDS of GARGANTUA”. The “Tesseract Abyss” update will be free for all players on all platforms and is scheduled for release on December 5.  
   
**Introducing Adventure Mode: Tesseract Abyss**  
Tesseract Abyss puts players into the deepest layers of the 4D space known as the “Tesseract”. By using weapons and coins earned by playing this mode, players will be able to continue into the abyss, gradually becoming stronger through equipment and abilities.  
   
**Level up your character!**  
Player rank goes up as your performance does. As your rank increases so do abilities of your choosing.  
   
**Become stronger through your abilities!**  
You can use your earned coins to strengthen your abilities, such as overall HP or your strength.  
Therefore, the more you play Tesseract Abyss the further you can progress!  
   
**Increase your strength through weapon smithing**  
You can combine duplicate weapons to make stronger versions of themselves. Depending on your strategy, you can collect and strengthen a lot of weaker type weapons or earn more powerful weapons later on and speed up the process.  
   
**Give yourself a temporary boost through artifacts**  
Artifacts are consumable items that players can purchase for temporary buffs, such as strength or health boosts. You can purchase with your coins and bring them into battle.  
   
**Carry items with you into the abyss**  
Bring your items and weapons into battle! Up to four weapons and/or artifacts can be brought into battle.  
   
Players can test their sword-wielding skills against the mighty Gargantua’s minions:

I've owned 6 headsets including  
HTC Vive  
Vive Pro  
Cosmos

Rift S

I got rid of all my HTC products.  

The Vive Pro is insanely overprice and used to get super hot for me.  I actually got it replaced and the second one was still super hot.  You will also be stuck with the wands

Tracking on the Cosmos is terrible even after the latest update and it's overpriced.   I was not a fan of this HMD at all

If you have a really beefy PC and want the arguably the best HMD, see if you know anyone in the states who can mail you an Index and controller set.  I just mailed one to a friend in South Africa

Otherwise I would recommend getting the Quest and Oculus Link cable (once available)  
or the Rift S.  It's definitely a big update from the OG Vive but it's a huge downgrade from the Index.  With the Quest you also gain a nice portable device and with the link cable it basically before a Rift S.",Vive

have you even signed up for the free steamvr tracking hdk, let alone read the documents?


there's a ton of people already using the controllers a trackers for their feet using natural locomotion.


each tracked device needs it's own radio. vive hmds have 2 built into it, one for each controller. a radio can't run more than one tracked device, so if you have two controllers and two trackers, you need 4 radios... 2 come from the vive, and 2 come as dongles with the trackers.


if you have 4 controllers, you need 4 radios, regardless of using them as trackers or not. as the hmd has 2 radios, you need 2 more, hence the dongles.


cross flashing firmware is useless, as it's steamvr that determines what shape and role each device uses.

"Im on the Vive with the Deluxe Audio Strap and am also considering upgrading.  I did, however, get the index controllers which are a crazy improvement over the original wands.

Slapping a controller on your foot and flashing a steam dongle is readily available, very documented, and plenty of people are doing it. (The reminder about the radio limitation was useful though)

I am talking about custom tracking solutions. More like this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz14Qv--I6A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz14Qv--I6A)  

Sure, two years ago htc said they were opening up their sdk. But I've seen very little implementation and I'm trying to gather info on other people's projects before jumping in and reinventing the wheel for custom tracking solutions. While the controller method is fun and functional, it's not custom tracker development. It's a slapdash workaround. 

As for questioning my credentials? Well, I spent the last four years running one of the largest makerspaces in the midsouth region where we were in discussion with htc about securing two HDK's for a local initiative to empower students through vr development. So yeah. I've read a good bit of the documentation. So I'm trying to catch up on any new developments in the last 24 months.",Vive
"Everyone complains about ""true blacks"" as if they are playing every game in total darkness.  I would agree that it's not as good as OLED for representing black levels, but it's not immersion breaking unless you're playing a game that requires you to be in near total darkness.   

Just about the only game that comes to mind for me is that one section of Arizona Sunshine.  I haven't yet tried it on the Index so I don't know how much worse it is, but even if it's absolutely terrible, that represents like 1% of my game library.",Vive
Not really related to VR; the interview is about his Palmer's more recent work with the DoD.,Vive
"Yeah, I already have that &amp; unfortunately there is no audio boost function. The program I'm referring to displays a little blue Vive triangle icon in your system tray, you right click it to access all the vive settings like being able to show notifications on your HMD from websites like FB messenger while in VR or link your phone and display notifications when you get a text etc.. I don't remember all the functions, I didn't really use any except for the audio boost. It was always part of the default installation before and now it just doesn't show up at all. Was pretty much essential to me and now it's mysteriously absent.",Vive
Downloading this now through viveport infinity. Excited to try it,Vive
"As someone who upgraded, the resolution/SDE is a major factor in wanting something better.  Also, FOV is a consideration.  I backed the Pimax 8K on kickstarter (and later switched to the 5K+) because of these two reasons.  I also have an Index and the resolution is way better than the original Vive.  It's not saying the Vive sucks...it's just that I had one since 2016 and I wanted something better now that something better is out there.   

I also tried a WMR headset or two (Lenovo Explorer and then later an Odyssey+) and the resolution is great on both of those, but the tracking isn't as good.  The Odyssey+ in particular did a great job of obscuring the SDE on OLED.  I know there's a way you can mix vive tracking with WMR and get the best of both worlds so maybe that's another option OP could consider.",Vive
"Pimax is great... if you're willing to tinker and put up with less than 100% compatibility with every game out there.  I mean, I know most games work and another handful of games work ok with Parallel projections, but it's not something I would heartily recommend to everyone out there.",Vive
Is it possible to get knuckles in canada?,Vive
The Vive is way better than rift though and you already own most of the hardware. Those 2 add-ons alone will greatly improve your comfort level. Comfort is a huge thing people don't account for much in VR.,Vive
"I think Pimax ships worldwide, and as for Revive, I haven't used it for that, but it was my understanding that you could actually play Oculus games without the need for revive at all.  That may have changed because I haven't been following it, but if you're heavily invested in the oculus ecosystem you might really want to consider Pimax.  

However, as for compatibility:  some games just don't seem to work on the older games, or if they do, you have to engage a special mode that eats up a bit more processing power to fix the image for the angled screens.  Modern games compensate for angled screens, but older games on older game engines expect the screens to be parallel to each other, so you have to use a ""parallel projection"" mode to get those to work right.

I'd say if you expect your headset to ""just work"" without tinkering or troubleshooting then avoid the pimax.  It does work great, but it's far from flawless and it uses an extra layer of software (Pitool) between itself and SteamVR to get it working.",Vive
Make out simulator haha.,Vive
This is actually Palmer's evil twin who sold out to facebook. You can tell by the facial hair. Now he wants to profit off our societies descent into fascism. Definitely not the lovable nerd who sparked the VR renaissance. Fuck this guy and fuck the other companies that are building technology for the future dystopian state.,Vive
"I don't live in Canada, so I don't know the direct answer.",Vive
"Motion smoothing causes seriously annoying screen stutter on my PC, I always switch it off &amp; consider it useless.",Vive
"Ah okay, I tried to find a way to purchase them but had no luck so far. Will probably start with the wireless adapter though as I've heard/seen good things",Vive
"I haven't used my pimax since August, but even back in August, I had frequent bouts where I would have to do a lot of restarting of the computer and/or the software just to get it running properly.  That's also not even counting the fact that there are games that require parallel projections to work properly, so if you plan on playing one of those you have to restart SteamVR with it enabled.  

On the other hand is the Index where I never need to restart, the software works pretty much flawlessly and I have no problems with parallel projections needing to be enabled.  

That's pretty much the main reason my pimax has been sitting idle since August.   I figure one of these days the software side of things will be on par with SteamVR but I'm pretty sure it's not there yet.  Hopefully they'll start working on getting that OpenXR support into everything and maybe then everything will be better.  I still wouldn't recommend someone buy a pimax without telling them first about the potential problems.",Vive
"i upgraded to the Vive pro and wireless, its incredible",Vive
And also sometime Vive PRO is the only option for people where Index doesn't ship..,Vive
"Thanks for answering. I made a Unity proyect and imported vrsteam and the SRanipal sdk packages. I opened one of the scenes from the sranipal package, the one where you can test the eye tracking. The eye tracking didnt work, I will try to start srruntime manually before y run the Unity game. My question is, the eye tracking is all dead already, or is there a workaround for it that you know. Do i need to calibrate to be able to use the eye tracking? thanks in advance",Vive
I think the vive pro with wireless and index controllers is best of both worlds. You can keep your basestations and use the wands as backup. I used a cross border service to get them.,Vive

"Without calibration you only get accurate relative eye movement, not accurate gaze vectors, but even relative eye movement depends on being able to detect the pupil accurately.   With what it is doing right now on my systems, none of the data is useful.

After successfully completing calibration you should be able to tell whether eye tracking is working  since it will show to a verification UI where it will highlight dots as you look at them.  If you can't get as far as a 'success' then the tracking is too broken to be worth looking at, at least as far as my own work is going.

If you can't get that working, then eye tracking data won't be valid in your own applications or in the demo applications either.",Vive

It's not that simple. No one knows why Valve are not selling in Canada currently but since the manual (at least my Index manual) references Canada in the warranty terms, it'll be out there sooner or later.  

&gt;  is the vive comos worth it? 

Absolutely not. It's overpriced crap. 

&gt; got a lot of comments about the rift or the quest as a better choice.

They're not but each to their own. 

&gt; Need some help! is the upgrade not big enough that i keep my htc vive ? 

The Index is. Everything else is not. 

The Rift-S is a sidegrade, not an upgrade from a Vive. Quest is it's own thing and not really something a PC VR gamer should be considering as a main PC VR headset, Cosmos is way over priced and the Win MR headsets are really good for sim pit players but not roomscale.    


&gt; can i use rift controllers with my htc vive?

No.



Everyone will have their own opinion and mine is that your best solution is to wait for the Index to launch in Canada. It will sooner or later as I said. At that point, you'll be able to just upgrade the headset and controllers or just the headset if you wish and use the rest of your Vive kit with it. Everything else you mentioned is a downgrade on tracking or not worth the price when you could, like I said, just buy an Index if you wait.",Vive
"Right, well it's not enough to ruin the immersion for me.  I mean, I suppose if I wanted to be disappointed I could go looking for it and I'd surely find it.   Unless I'm switching back and forth between OLED and LCD, it's not enough of a difference to bother me.",Vive
"It would only be better if you really really don't want inside out tracking. The Rift S is miles ahead of the OG Vive in every aspect aside from the the tracking, and even then it's still plenty good for pretty much everything.",Vive
"That's likely an issue with Skyrim itself and not something you can fix. There are lots of PC games that will both refuse to change audio streams to match the Windows default device, AND they will not re-initiate the audio when their selected device disappears and comes back. I believe even flat mode Skyrim will behave this way.",Vive

Thank you!,Vive
Thanks!,Vive
"Fuckin ""ugly wands"" - those are the best controllers out there besides the index'

Cosmos is trash, the controllers use batteries and have 2hr battery life, and you're paying too much for what you get. Get a friend you trust in the states to mail you an index or something

I've stuck with the base Vive for forever now, and I'm only gonna upgrade to the index.",Vive
you work for htc? Answer me this: why is your customer service so horrible?,Vive
"I always forget about the damned IPD. Though to be fair the vast majority of people fall in that range. I had one person at the arcade who was at the minimum of the OG Vive. She complained that the last time she was in she had a headache at the end. Just looking at her face I figured it was because the IPD didn't get set for her.

It's a very unimportant feature until you need it, and then it's a make or break thing.",Vive

"I work close with them and their enterprise side isn't awful, so maybe thats where they put most of their resources... nonetheless doesn't make it acceptable.",Vive
I’d just keep the vibe by its self. The deluxe audio is just a headset which isn’t all that good and not worth the price,Vive
...and that's not just lip service!,Vive
"I have an index and also still use my vive DAS + wireless. The wireless is a neat experience in its own and tbh if I'm really immersed in a game, and crank up the SS- I tend to tune out the SDE and focus on aiming and trying to kill someone etc. With that being said the index is clearly the superior product, but the vive is still pretty baller currently. Wouldn't buy again though from HTC given how many controller problems I've had with the wands.",Vive
Agreed this is the best advice tbh.,Vive
"As someone with the wireless adapter on Vive Pro, I don't think I could go back to tethered. 

But at the same time, the clarity bump from Vive OG to Rift S might be nice",Vive
Needs tongue tracking!,Vive
Doesn't the Vive already have grey blacks to avoid OLED purple smear?,Vive
"You could go Vive Pro or Index

&amp;#x200B;

The nice thing with Vive, is that all the parts are interchangeable. Aka you can use the original controllers, base stations, etc.

Cosmos are a downgrade like someone else said, anything without lighthouse tracking usually has trouble.",Vive
"I've just gone through all the research for this, as I have an OG Vive with the DAS, but after 3 years of solid use it's starting to get a bit shabby. Basic outline of the latest choices:  


Vive Cosmos: Sounds interesting with no lightboxes and a PC-grade inside-out tracking headset (no base stations) that can take a wireless module. But I've only heard problems with it and it's not current ""best"" at anything.  


Quest: Sort of like a Gear VR-level unit but with inside-out tracking.  


Index: Best FOV (which to me is a bigger deal than screen door), reportedly best picture of them all because each pixel has full RGB subpixels, which apparently makes a visible difference and completely eliminates screen door effect (I can't confirm this first-hand. Yet.) Plus, it'll work with your light boxes and wands if you want to just get headset only which will be cheaper. Audio is amazing. Downside, no inside out tracking, no wireless, at least for the foreseeable future.  


So everything's some form of tradeoff. I just ordered the index; headset only is sold out at this time so I'm getting the set with controllers and using the light boxes I have. I'm with Ripsonfools on this: either wait until you can get your hands on an Index or see if you can get it some other way; I saw in another thread that there was site someone used a site to get it overseas; apologies for not remembering the name but some research should dig it up. I'll update if it helps after the new headset comes in.",Vive
"&gt; Vive Wireless

This is why I haven't gotten the Index. Any time I use a wired Vive (when I'm developing) it always sucks and ruins the experience. I'm thinking about getting the Index controllers and waiting for wireless before I get the Index.",Vive
"The cosmos is pure garbage, stay away from it",Vive
"Try the Pimax 5k+. It's awesome, such a good upgrade.",Vive
The USB port on the battery eventually goes bad. I have 3 batteries now and all of them easily cause the wireless to blip off. The solution I found was the head mount the battery snugly with a short thick USB cable so it does not move around at all. It works fine now.,Vive
"I'm gonna throw a more controversial pick, a pimax 5k+

 it's fully compatible with the lighthouses and controllers. It's got similar sde and clarity to the index, but a much wider fov. 

The biggest problem is it is much more uncomfortable than the index at stock. I have mine with the DAS

Rift s is also not bad, unless you have a uncommon ipd. Vive cosmos has been largely regarded as not good.",Vive

Wait it out. Put some money aside each month in a little VR fund. Wait as long as you can stand to wait for as many hardware generations as you can stand to wait, and then spend the money on what's available then.

Just buy the Vive wireless. None of the others do wireless as of right now so go all in with htc Vive,Vive
Cosmos is a budget system for people who don't want to splash out on Lighthouse-based inside-out tracking.,Vive
Cosmos is trash. There’s not even a dispute. It’s shit b,Vive
"Yeah but he has a Vive already so you can knock off the base stations and optionally the knuckles. Still pricey but it would be the best experience due to the wireless plus clarity (plus knuckles if you splurge). 

I'm hoping HTC sell the cosmos headset without controllers and with the lighthouse module standalone but if not, well... yeah.

Honestly happy to jump ship to another headset if they release a wireless module as good as HTC has. HTC gives you a lot of options but pricing is definitely expensive once you add it up.

There really is no single best option on the market I think.",Vive
Ya I thought that too except i figured if they got $1600. It’s cheaper and better to just pay extra to have someone or a company ship them the index.,Vive
I had to return the Oculus Go for this reason.,Vive
Fund a way of getting an Index. I used to use a vive for work. Recently upgraded to an index and the vive feels like trash. The controller tracking in the cosmos is very poor. If you cannot upgrade to an index yet your best option is to wait.,Vive
"Having upgraded from Vibe to index, I’m happy with my upgrade. However, I was (and still am) very pleased with my Vive. Just stick with it for the time being.",Vive
"Think of it like a phone. If you wrap your phone in a blanket and leave it on the charger. It’s gunna get warm. It’s not a good idea and maybe could even be a fire hazard. But is it gunna break the phone? Nah. 


But if you leave it in a hot car all day, there’s a good chance summins gotten fucked. At the very least you’ve lost a LOT of ur battery life. Leave it in a hot car on a regular basis and the phone isn’t gunna have a stable battery for long oh and don’t be surprised if it finally got too hot and just stops working. That’s inevitable as well. But that doesn’t mean it’s prone to overheating. 

If it’s hot to the touch, u have it in too warm of a spot. That’s the only concern here. It’s normal to get warm. But don’t intentionally make it endure heat. It can handle it but a problem down the road is more inevitable the more you allow it to happen.",Vive

So now I have a ""guest"" Vive too 😎",Vive
"&gt; The Vive is way better than rift though

Vive is marginally better than original Rift, but that's debatable. Better tracking but worse controllers. 

Vive is in no way better than Rift S. My Rift S has long taken over my Vive as my default headset. The resolution and comfort are way better. The inside out tracking is good enough for me to not notice any difference in games and the controllers are much better than the wands. The only downside is audio, but I can live with putting on some overear headphones.",Vive

While I do expect to pay something for a networking asset, I don't need a Cloud-based subscription model.  Maybe in some other lifetime if I ever make money at a hobby. :)

As for other Unity networking assets - I've only tried basic UNet (on which Photon is built), which I clearly can't recommend, and one other custom in-house framework, but nothing else that's publicly available.",Vive
"It has two big problems. 

The tracking is noticeably inferior to other inside-out headsets, both for the headset itself and the controllers. It's been improved in the latest beta firmware, but it's still not as good as the Quest or Rift S, or even WMR headsets. 

The flipup design means you can't get a good seal on your face and lots of light leak, hard to maintain sweet spot.",Vive
"I also have a Rift cv1 w/2x sensors and I bought the Cosmos (preordered it).  While there are still some tracking issues and difficult to get lighting just right both of these issues are slowly improving with each update.  I’m pretty confident that these will be addressed over the next month or two.  During this period I’m continuing to run my Rift as well and the 2 systems seem to play well together and I’m finding it handy to have both installed.

I also bought the Cosmos wireless kit and I’m really enjoying this.  You won’t be able to use this with your laptop though since you need a pcie3 slot for the wireless card.

That being said I read discussions regarding tracking issues when riftS was a released as well. 

I read somewhere that the cameras on the cosmos are RGB compared to the standard IR cameras used on the riftS and quest. IR tends to perform a lot better in low light.. makes me wonder why they didn’t go the IR route.

"Ick.

You are definitely rolling multiple pairs of dice hoping an egpu configuration will work with a VR headset. It's not a supported configuration. A headset still having birthing pains makes it more risky to get fancy in a setup.

Look at video reviews of the Cosmos and you will see the tracking with hand positions needed for serious shooters is completely broken.

If you are looking for a not-facebook travel friendly headset with quality parity to your Rift I would look at Samsung Odyssey. Of course researching to  seeif if those WMR headset drivers puke with egpu.

The tracking on that headset is reasonable for inside out and the optics are top tier for VR first wave headsets. The software support is generally increasing for WMR. 

The facial fit tolerances are a weakness. It's too constricting and uncomfortable for many people's faces.",Vive

Yeah can’t even update it...,Vive
"There is a lot of misinformation out there.  Only the front 2 cameras are rgb, like the Vive Pro and this is why you get color pass through.  The Cosmos cameras are actually superior to the Rift S and Quest camera’s imho.  Vive just needs to get the tracking/lighting algorithms right.  Once they do this the advantages of these cameras will be evident.

Also, I do not notice any light leakage.  Just a little below my nose but less than my Rift cv1.

I have do have multiple setups and systems to test it, the egpu will be a deal breaker if it doesn’t work, as I purchased this for travel (I am fairly optimistic I can get it to work though, I haven’t had an issue as of yet running an egpu in any configuration I’ve encountered ) worst case I’ll just return it if need be.

3 - My friends with glasses completely satisfied with using my OG Vive (and now Vive Pro) with GearVR mod. Only one ajustment they do is lens-to-eye distance so they din't scratch glasses or vive lens.

For me there is no way back after this Mod, god rays almost nonexistent right now and image much more clear than before. SDE became a little bit noticeable with GearVR lens and there is some barrel distortion, but I am perfectly fine with this.  
And be careful with dust, I recommend you to buy get canned air / gas duster, just in case. Because even smallest dust particles on your lens or screens would be perfectly visible through the lens.",Vive

You have.  Cancel the order.,Vive
"ok there is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimvr/comments/a645lm/guide_how_to_install_skse_vr_and_skyui_vr/) guide, which gives different instructions for installing than the SKSEVR readme, neither worked. im using Vortex.",Vive
"At those specs and budget the Rift-S would be a good option. 61 is on the low end of the recommended IPD range for it though.  *“Best for users between 61.5 and 65.5mm”.* Test it somewhere if you can.

Another option to consider is the Quest, especially if you want to have portability. It will get a Link cable soon which means it will double as a PC headset. I would recommend waiting for reviews of that though.

As a third option you have WMR headsets like the Odyssey+, but do note that they do not compare to Oculus solutions in controllers or controller tracking volume.",Vive
"I watched that when it came out. They are great.

Something about the Cosmos controllers and the gaudy battery killing lighting is poking at my gut.

The low light performance and bright light controllers has me wondering if the problem is optics deasign problem not a computer vision software problem

A classic problem with lighting, exposure and dynamic range like all cameras could have.",Vive
"Hmm, I'll have to look into these. Thank you!",Vive
"I modded 2 vives one with fixed and one with adjustable.
Fixed one is my daily device, as other had said once done and barrel distortion correction aplieds never looked back, been using it for more than a year now.

Modded with adjustable lenses one is my father's device, he tried it once and never used the device again. I think there are mods with orescription lenses thst would be more interesting.",Vive
"Can you let us know which games work well with this feature? H3VR definitely doesn't, and neither does fpsVR, which is tough to deal with.",Vive
Yes :(,Vive
"I'd also say Rift S is better for traveling, for being less bulky and lighter. I was really surprised how bulky hmd and especially controllers are- they somehow took much more space where I was storing them than Rift S does.",Vive
"I didn't update, but my base station is showing the same symptoms. Mine is probably dead, as I could see that one of the lasers weren't lit (described by someone else here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/990dzt/im\_sad\_base\_station\_internal\_fault\_02\_error\_10009/e4k1hvx?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/990dzt/im_sad_base_station_internal_fault_02_error_10009/e4k1hvx?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) )

[Are you able to upgrade?](/r/Vive/comments/dw69pu/are_you_able_to_upgrade/) by  YeehawMagic


I'm ordering an older-gen vive and was wondering if I could upgrade my kit later down the line individually or would I need to purchase an entirely new set

"They are still working on it. Just checked and they just updated saying built in stereo rendering coming soon!
https://grandtheftvr.com/",Vive
"Welp, guess my wallet will now be 15€ lighter...",Vive
Ordering expensive toys without doing proper research first is always a mistake imo.,Vive
"Yeah I’m cancelling my order in the morning and will wait it out... only time will tell if the cosmos gets better..I’ve been reading shit all night about this product, it’s making my head spin. 

The specs on paper look damn good, but 4 hour average battery life on controllers? I’d be replacing/swapping batteries all the time. For me, little things like that are very annoying, and represent a lack of attention to detail. It may be possible that HTC and Valve ending their vr relationship resulted in the significant oversight and problems plaguing the Cosmos at the moment. 

You have a point about the controllers, something doesn’t seem right that they need to emit that much light to be tracked well.

 
 I think you might be right about the Quest, and with their release of The link cable coming soon, it’s probably the best travel option on the market at the moment. 

How does lower refresh rate feel on the quest?",Vive
"Yeah, that was def my mistake. I’m gonna cancel the order in the morning. 

The OG Vive was such a great product I ignorantly assumed the cosmos would live up to the name. 

We’ll see, I’ll keep a close eye on the progress of updates over the next couple months.. if they iron out all the bugs and fix the tracking issues, it may be a very worth while purchase, it may also be cheaper by then, who knows..",Vive
"Cancel your order, and good luck getting your money back.

I returned mine and it’s been 18 days and counting since they got it back, still no refund.",Vive
"I was actually not happy about Eleven either until I tried the beta with the improved physics. That one is good enough, but in the beta I'm (for now) stuck in a single room with a bad AI opponent, so I hoped VR Ping Pong Pro would bring both good physics and nice environments. Instead they just removed their stated Index support.

Something that doesn't feel like real table tennis would **not** be more fun for me, no matter how it looks.",Vive
"I ordered through dell with my business account, should be easy.. After reading reviews of the cosmos all night I’ve heard People complain that HTC customer service is abysmal.",Vive
"Good advice, thanks.  I will be raising a dispute.

The support feel like you’re talking to bots, generic answers and no real progress or updates.",Vive
"Got mine from ebay with the lenses fitted (non adjustable) and I've used in my OG Vive and loved it, moved them to my Pro and they are still the best lenses I've seen in VR. Crystal clear view edge to edge, look around with your eyes and not your head, no glare or godrays... basically I'm never going back to the Fresnel crap lenses again and refuse to buy any HMD in the future that sticks to Fresnel lenses.",Vive
"Ive used lots. Mostly normal hdmi cables. No active ones

I used an active one for 30ft andvtgst worked fine but for a few metres s normal 4k compatible one worked.  My rule was not cheap... not expensive.. just get mid range... you can always return if it doesn't work",Vive
"What are you even talking about. Just uninstall, sell your pc and start playing mobile games because this is not for you.",Vive
"Could that be you have some overlay enabled, like Wolf Overlay or Nvidia Experience ?  
I had same problem some time ago with overlay auto-enabled after updating drivers and some games crashed.",Vive
I don't think so. I didn't do anything since it worked last time. Maybe I should try to reinstall Nvidia drivers,Vive
"&gt; The flipup design means you can't get a good seal on your face and lots of light leak, hard to maintain sweet spot. 

It seems that can be remedied by removing the facial padding, and modifying the headset with Velcro straps.

"The Cosmos controllers are not set up for all games yet.  
In steam you can add controller settings for the cosmos controllers. 

[https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-custom-keybindings-steamvr](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-custom-keybindings-steamvr)

Try to look at the controls of the vive and try copying it as good as posible. Dont forget to add the action proces, haptics and skeleton since these make sure the tracking is right!.

Some games (pavlov) have some community settings that work fine but other non populair games do not.

Game devs havent set the controls for the new Cosmos controllers yet so you sadly ave to do it yourself sometimes...

Hope this works if not let me know and I may be able to help!

"There are 2 mirroring options and one seem to have impact on your performance, while other does not.  


1 - using game ( application ) rendering window

2- using steam VR display mirroring  


Using option 1 may impact your performance and I've notice some stuttering. Off course this depends on the game.  
It's nothing more than rendering game on 2 hi-res screens at the same time.  


Option 2 is to use Steam VR display mirror (option in steam VR) it can run in full screen and it's nothing more than just direct mirror of what's displayed in your VR.  Briefly speaking it works in the same way as playing a movie while playing game. No rendering happens, at least not as much as in case of option 1.  


Personally I use option 2 for VR parties, recordings from VR or streaming. Personally it's better as it displays your controllers and some additional screens as such as OVRDrop.",Vive
"well... let's not get things too complicated then :)   
I'll try to help and let's see it this works.  


\- Since steam VR updates itself via Steam maybe some of the settings got corrupted. Sometimes you just need to reinstall Steam VR, especially you WANT to reinstall VR runtime.

\- Disable   Steam theater setting if enabled. That often makes games crash  
\- Disable STEAM BETA participation if enabled, sometimes that may cause some issues, especially after STEAM update.

\-Another thing is Direct X. I assume your problem is only related to VR, while same games work on monitor ?  
If not it would be worth to reinstall Direct X.  


Also it may help to share error logs.... \\steam\\logs  - in there you'll see all the logs for steamVR   


Good luck and shout loud if you need some help...",Vive
"So there WILL be custom songs in this game? 

I bought and refunded this almost immediately when I saw there were only ten songs and who knows when the devs would release more official titles.",Vive
"It feels like there's something more going on at Facebook that meets the eye. I mean just recently he was on JRE and was very enthusiastic about VR and its promise in general, you can tell through the conversation that there was no way he was thinking about quitting back then.

Now just two months later and he's suddenly ""disappointed"" in the pace of VR development and leaves to work on a hobby AGI project that he has never really expressed interest in before. Maybe it's too much tinfoil, but it really feels like there's been some shenanigans behind the scenes and he just said screw it.",Vive
restart steamvr and see if update goes away.,Vive
"He also hinted at in that jre interview that he most enjoyed coding and didn't care much for managerial aspects. He talked excitedly about following new technology trends as well. Maybe he just reevaluated his life and decided to get back to the parts of his life he enjoyed the most and go back to a coding position.

I could be reading into it in the wrong way but that's my perspective on it.",Vive
"I look forward to Carmack making something that can be utilised in games. This is the guy who revolutionised gaming, he was wasted at oculus.",Vive
"He has expressed interest in AGI before, though that doesn’t discount the possibility of there being something more going on. He expressed some mild concerns about the way some things were being handled in his Connect talk.",Vive
Ok this is not exactly what you asked. But I left the cv1 to get a vive pro. I bought a vive used for the sensors and controllers. Than bought the vive pro HMD.  I was originally set on a Index HMD but it was out of stock. I got a used vive pro for cheaper used anyway. Tracking is a huge improvement to the cv1. I also ordered the gear mod and put it in my OG vive while i waited for my vive pro. Sure their is the screen door but it looked way better than the CV1. When i recieved my vive pro it was great. It was way better with the gear mod. I do not even plan on getting a index HMD at this point. I keep seeing issues with the rift s. Some people have had to get replacements and the issues still exist. so they repeat and repeat. Rift s is great if it works for you. But the tacking well not be as good. Still playable but not as good. I got my vive pro setup for about $700. plus gear mod was $60. That is close to your Cosmos cost. The vive setup came with DAS for the original setup. Great deal. Plus i have a backup headset if my vive pro breaks  and with the gear mod i was really happy with the original vive honestly. I think this is a better route. return that shit.,Vive
"believe it or not the physics is actually the easier part. VRPPP is starting from a good place.

Eleven, which has had about 45 updates and refinements was a complete mess when the game launched.",Vive
The Vive has been discontinued and is obsolete in most ways anyway. Don't waste your money on it unless you can get it really cheap.,Vive
"Yeah, but he was allowed to spend 50% of his time on coding despite his managerial position and he worked directly on the GearVR and Quest codebases. Unless that changed, it just seems like a very weird quick turnaround. 

Anyway, that's just speculation of course.",Vive
Yeah I noticed that. I hadn't looked in awhile so I wasn't sure if that was new or normal or not.,Vive
"He was anything but wasted, the stuff he pulled off for mobile VR is quite a feat. But I can imagine he saw he solved most of the hard challenges at this point and just wants to move on to the rest of the challenges on his bucket list.",Vive
Maybe weak Quest sales?  He was the main driver behind Quest. if it isn't a knockout success Facebook probably isn't interested.,Vive
I can't blame anyone for wanting to distance themselves from Facebook.,Vive
I upgraded recently and didn't notice much difference.,Vive
"&gt; before buying the Vive 

Vive has been discontinued, I recommend buying something that is not nearly 4 years old.",Vive
"So, what did he steal this time?   lol",Vive
So the original HTC batteries are no good with Cosmos? I imagine those Anker powerbanks everyone recommends are also no-go? Damn.,Vive
what would be good? Index is much pricier,Vive
"Depends on multiple factors like your pc specs, ipd, use cases, budget etc.

However generally speaking the popular options are:

* Index
* Rift-S
* Quest
* WMR headsets

If you give more details, we can give more specific recommendations.",Vive
"Specs?
1060 6GB
IPD? should be slightly smaller than the normal adult
Use cases? non commercial
budget? don't really have a limit, ignore this for now",Vive
"Maybe, this mod you replace 1 of the songs in the game with another. As long as the BPM is close it works pretty close",Vive
"You can't get the best out of the Index with a 1060. 

With use-cases I meant more on the lines of ""what you intend to play/use it for?"", because the recommendations are very different for flight/driving simulators for example.

If you want a good PC based ""can do anything"" setup, the decision is realistically between the Index and the Rift-S. 

However the Quest is also worth considering, it gets a Link cable soon that will allow it to be used also as a PC headset. If portability is something you woul value, the Quest really has no competition as of yet.

On the WMR side the Odyssey+ can be ridiculously good value if you can find it when it is on sale, however its controllers and controller tracking volume can't compete with the other setups listed above.",Vive
"I mean, MSI Afterburner solves lots of problems ;)

I am slightly inclined to Index because it is from Valve and well, people can finally see you flipping them off without the game censoring swears.

I think I would play Rec Room, Beat Saber, HOLOception. Maybe some experiments of myself in Unity3D too.",Vive
"Afterburner wont solve this problem. Running the heavier titles with good settings on the Index at 120 or 144 Hz refresh will leave a overclocked 2080 Ti crying for mercy.

But at 90 Hz you should be fine. 

Do note that you will get like 80-90% of the experience on the Rift-S for a third of the price. But if you want to pay the premium for the Index, it is better.",Vive
"I started VR on a cardboard so for me anything above 2 fps feels awesome.

If you switch between headsets you will notice.  It is like screen door effect though. Some people stop seeing it while immersed and some can't unsee it

A definite trade off. You are bringing that laptop so it's extra difficult a decision.

For me though the amount of flexibility you get and fun you get for the price is too compelling even if I had a mobile super?omputer.i think you said it's your work laptop.?

Leave that damn thing at home. Go on vacation, get a suite and invite over some local hotties to ""play beatsaber""",Vive
"I know Afterburner won't help much..

Well it is just personal preference to pay $500 extra for finger tracking",Vive
Hearts and minds.,Vive
I mean perfecting middle of the line hardware to me is wasted.,Vive
"I've never done this but I do know something about adhesives don't use cyanoacetylate ( common variety super glue ) that would be very bad. I'm not aware of replacements being sold.

 I would look at using something like adhesive velcro strips from 3M or similar. Obviously you would only need one half and could cut and trim to suit.",Vive
"That makes sense...  Robots covet the organic assets, after all.",Vive
"""before he gets to old"" lol",Vive
Yes. Sure. I'm bad at PCs. Right. Barely heard of them. Right.,Vive
There is now a foundation for others to build off of. Everything they need to add to make it THE VR system is now obvious and in capable hands. He planted the seed that will become mainstream VR.,Vive

Quest sales have exceeded all expectations wildly.,Vive
at launch...how is it doing now that everyone who wants one got it already?,Vive
"Everything functional about the Vive, the display, lenses, tracking, controller design, all of it was developed by Valve.  But valve had no interest at the time in mass-producing VR hardware, just in developing it, so they partnered with HTC who changed the top of the controller from looking like a top-hat to looking like a donut, and designed the housing of the Vive headset itself, the plastic shell.  

Everything everyone loves about the Vive was built by Valve, not HTC.",Vive
John Carmack looks like every generic lesbian in her 60s.,Vive
Very well still. Huge game sales too.,Vive
"Hey thanks for sharing that, I’m too not familiar with the valve and HTC relationship. 

Oddly though, I was just watching a video from 6 months ago regarding the rift s tracking. It had similar issues out of the gate as well. 

I think these problems will be resolved eventually tbh. Another poster mentioned that they are using IR cameras on four of the 6 sensors, so low light shouldn’t even be an issue with the right calibration. 

It will be interesting see how this headset develops over the next couple months. I do see potential for sure.",Vive
"Maybe the pace of VR is what he means. He might just want to work on something that he feels he is having more of an impact on and getting more back from (in terms of pace). VR was his most recent passion but he has shifted through many fields over the years, so might just be time for him to work on something else.

Hopefully it's not signs of oculus/Facebook having issues. Although I wouldn't be surprised.",Vive
"My bet is that he's not happy with Oculus focusing on Quest, which is inherently under powered compared to PC VR.  The Quest is neat with it's cable-free form factor but with Carmack always wanting to push the limits there's only so much that Quest can do in terms of experience.",Vive
"Index is fantastic but it doesn't provide anything new to VR. The Quest is actually more of a step forward for VR as an industry and tech. What did valve do with the index that is revolutionary or new?

The Quest is something your grandmother can use. It's not the highest fidelity in a graphical sense but as a complete package it's the most affordable and accessible.

The index is the best consumer grade headset out there. It absolutely blows the quest out of the water in raw experience. But from a big picture perspective, of VR as a medium, Quest is far more innovative and impactful.",Vive
He's still not gonna scissor you. Get over it.,Vive
Seems to break virtual desktop as well (not sure if that is unity underneath).,Vive
link?  I personally don't know anyone with a Quest.  Even people who are casually interested in VR have a Vive.,Vive

"Your anecdotal evidence doesn't make it true. A Vive is twice the cost if a Quest just for the headset, plus you need a gaming PC on top. It's around 4-5x the cost of entry.",Vive
Quest was Carmack's project.  He has said he prefers writing code for and optimizing on Quest because it's more of a challenge.,Vive

Optitrack it's a commercial warehouse scale solution. I imagine eventually quest will make it obsolete for that purpose. They also use it for motion capture.,Vive
Do you think this is doable with 4 vive pros as they claim the base stations can now support 10m x 10m?,Vive

This is cool,Vive
I imagine you could do that with the new base stations in a reasonably large space but they would still need laptop strapped to their back as I don't think the wireless would work for two people in that big of a space. You would also need custom software that allows the two people to sync their universe so they essentially share the same universe. I have never tried anything like this though so take what I say with a grain of salt.,Vive

"Yes, but he's also expressed frustrations with the lower power of the mobile processor.

Realistically Used Vive or Rift S for entry level pcVR (I consider WMR EOL) and if you want premium Index.....


Then you might have specific use cases for Vive Pro/Pimax if you need great color/super high fov.


tl;dr at its price point I don't see the cosmos offering anything that other solutions don't offer better",Vive
Thank you very much! :),Vive
please fix it! its getting worse and worse!,Vive
"The original HTC battery wont work, but I've read that people have been getting it to work with some anker power banks though",Vive
"&gt; It feels like there’s something more going on at Facebook than meets the eye.

Coming up at 10, water is wet!",Vive
"Quest seems to be doing well enough, but the [Facebook earnings call](https://www.roadtovr.com/facebook-vr-longer-than-expected-mass-adoption/) sounded more like damage control, than the announcement of mind boggling sales. VR as a whole is advancing way slower than people expected, see also [Abrash's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YIGT13bdXw&amp;t=355).",Vive
"I hope the devs prove us wrong, but it does feel it's gonna be much more tricky than Beat Saber to make a good track.",Vive
Are you UK? If so try www.webuy.com,Vive
"VR as a whole is slow but the Quest isn't. 

&gt; Oculus Quest, which only launched a few months ago, has now reached an estimated installed base of 400,000, having sold 180,000 units during Q3, “nearly double the combined sales figures for the Oculus Rift S and Oculus Go

It's already at about 10% of the PSVR's total sales after six months, while the PSVR is over three years old and half the price",Vive
"Eh, I mean he was helping Oculus, not VR in general. Given Oculus's philosophy what is good for Oculus is not necessarily good for VR, and in many cases is harmful to VR.",Vive
"Those numbers are exactly what I would call slow. PSVR sold over 4.2 million units in three years, about 350000 per quarter. So Quest's sales pace is still below PSVR. And PSVR by itself isn't exactly a crazy well selling device to begin with, with only 5% of PS4 owners having one.

If you want solid AAA support you need to sell at least as well as *PS4*, not the PSVR, or better yet as much as PS4, Xbox and PC combined. 

Or to put it another way: Quest is selling about as well as the VirtualBoy, which sold about 770000 units in half a year. It might be enough, but it's not amazing by any stretch.",Vive
"To be honest, you’re probably better off contacting Vive Support on this one. It may be a problem with your controllers or lighthouses. If you never turn off the lighthouses, the little stabilization motor inside them wears out, and can’t keep the lighthouses stable. To check that, just touch them while they’re running. If you can feel a little vibration in both of them, then they should be fine. If you don’t feel any vibration, you’ll either have to DIY the lighthouse and put in a new motor or buy a new one. The controllers, however, could be a number of issues. You may just want to buy some new ones that you can return for a full refund to figure out if that’s the problem.",Vive
More like scissor hold.,Vive
"Unfortunately not yet, but it sounds interesting. Definitely different than Eye in the Sky, though",Vive
"mine is actually a GTX970 XD so that is exactly what i figured, next year i might be able to upgrade but it aint happening in 2019 lol unfortunately",Vive
"Hm. Try lowering the textures to low on Pavlov, that might solve it for that game. The game uses CLOSE to 3 GB VRAM, but since you have 3.5, you should be more or less fine, imo",Vive
In order to keep the account persist across our apps we need accounts unfortunately. Also to attach your personal data to a ID.,Vive
"Following the rest of Oculus, this seems normal.     

And they were on a similar path, Facebook is focused on live photogrammetry at the moment, i.e. the face tracking demo, and now we get finger controls soon, because cameras are very cheep sensors and can be put everywhere.

I feel like his talent was wasted there honestly, anywhere else is better.",Vive
"The PSVR had a much larger install base, and is half the cost of the Quest. You might be on a quest to downplay the Quest, but you're on your own.",Vive
"I think at this point the half dome is just a carrot for the og supporters and I don't see facebook selling a &gt;600$ enthusiast headset . Carmack on the other hand is a pragmatic, I don't think he has any interest in working on something that will stay in FB's  IP drawers and not benefit the users.",Vive
"Facebook's stated goal is to have ""1 billion people using their VR"". At it's current pace, the Quest will only take a 1000 years to get there. See where expectations and reality have a little of a disconnect here? Things have to speed up *a lot* for VR to became relevant in the mainstream before every current VR enthusiast is dead.

Another thing, Facebook also announced that it's users have spent more than $100 million on Oculus content. Well, lets look at another little Kickstarter project from that time: Star Citizen, they have made $250 million.

No matter how you twist it, VR isn't the runaway success everybody hoped for, it's not even close. At best it's doing good enough to not die gain, but it's a very tiny niche compared to every other entertainment medium around.",Vive
"i will try that for sure

i really havent played with my graphic settings in anything in vr other than skyrim vr for some reason. Which is odd because usually i tweak everything to get best appearence and best performance.",Vive
"While I haven't specifically seen the underside of the velcro, I'm pretty sure you can't possibly go wrong with homax welder glue. Its in a little red tube and on amazon or lowes. Very good strong stuff and what I use to glue velcro on rc vehicles.  Try it out on a similar test piece just to see before pitting it on the vive since it will be pretty permanent.

It is very similar to shoe goo which is also very good stuff, but shoe goo is way thicker.",Vive
In the long run I think you will be sorry you did this imho.  Your $'s so your choice of course.,Vive
I have no problem with light leakage.  Just a little below my nose which I don't really mind because it gives me a little peeking room without flipping up the screen.  The flip up screen is a nice thing btw.,Vive
"Sorry but that just is not the case, at least not for me.",Vive
Since when is gear vr one of the most popular headsets? I since when was that even on the map?,Vive
"lighter = cheaper and more prone to damage imho.  Those are made from Lenovo so what do you expect, lol!  The Cosmos controllers feel fine to me and do not take up that much extra storage/desktop space imho.  I'm using Eneloop rechargeables and I'm getting 6-8 hours runtime, about the same as any WMR controller that I've previously used.",Vive
He said he wanted to be on the bleeding edge of vr and prototype stuff. Now that a lot of the intense stuff is figured out fb is probably good for the next3 vr headsets. Source oc6,Vive
I wouldn't put too much stock in rumors about HTC's future developments. The cosmos launch is such a huge failure I'd be halfway surprised if HTC still exists in a year.,Vive
"I'm sure the Vive Pro is a good alternative and I did consider this, as well as the Index (which still is not available in Australia anyway).  However, I wanted to avoid lighthouses.  I'm also really enjoying the Cosmos Wireless.  Works great!

I still have my good old Oculus Rift cv1 w/2x sensors btw.  It plays well with my Cosmos setup and it's nice to be bi-headset-able imho because some Oculus store games still play best with my Rift's oled screens and with SS = 2.0 still look very good as well.",Vive
you can manually set it in the drop down list of games if they are installed in steamVR settings,Vive
"HTC is selling refurbed OG Vives for the price of a new Rift S, so I guess they're not looking for price-sensitive shoppers.",Vive
I actually played this plus Lab's bow and arrow and it was playable for me.  Still need some improvments though for sure.,Vive
"The Rift S is a good inexpensive alternative for sure.  However, I do not think it is as future proof as the Cosmos.  Time will tell I guess.",Vive
It will get better imho.,Vive
"Oh, isn't there an option like 'Complete Set' or something? Please confirm that it can't be done, then I'll pass that to publisher.",Vive
"There's honestly nothing ""future proof"" about any current VR headset...",Vive
Samsung must have given away millions of them. They'd be in wide use if you didn't constantly need a new one when you changed phones.,Vive
"Oof. Never heard of them or anyone thats used them. Ive heard of the samsung odyssey, but gear not at all",Vive
"No, you can use whatever headphones you like. Your virtual character will have virtual 'ears'. The headphones will connect these 'ears' to your real ears just like the lenses and screens connect your virtual eyes to your real eyes.",Vive
"Update; 

Getting a proper QC3.0 wall charger has helped quite a bit.  I'm now getting \~ 2 hrs runtime and \~3 hours to recharge.

Actually, low light with wireless now seems a lot better with 1.0.8.1.   I did get one low light warning but this disappeared pretty fast and did not seem to effect the quality of my visuals = still very good.  Maybe the power saving disable option that appeared with this update (and I enabled) helped. 

	Aside #1;  Just for fun I tried using the 18W battery that came with the old wireless kit.  Fully charged (4x green lights, not blue like the 21W) I got \~30-45 minutes of runtime before it stopped working properly = blank headset screen.  So, not completely useless and at least I can still use this to charge things like my iPhone,. Once I get my new (kinda expensive because I needed to buy another Cosmos adapter kit) 21W battery I should be fine with hot swaps. 

	Aside # 2; I found wrapping the headset/wireless cable one turn around the headband behind the left earphone helped get rid of the rear slack.  I used the little Velcro strap that came with the very long wireless battery lead to help keep this in place and I have not noticed any problems or noticed any discomfort.  

	Aside# 3;  I found using the Link Box USB cable (L1, which you do not need once you go wireless btw)) to connect to the wireless battery works very well.  It is a lot shorter but still reaches my front shirt pocket or right pant belt no problem.  It also seems to be a better quality lead so maybe it is a bit more efficient, but I don't really know for sure.  A lot better than the long thin wireless battery lead imho.  I also like not having to use the Cosmos link Box and power adapter.  Makes for a nicer, cleaner installation and frees up one DP port on your GPU.",Vive
... Damnit...,Vive
"It seems that it's being phased out now, but go back 2, 3 and 4 years ago and they had a lot of promos where you would get one free with your Galaxy smartphone.",Vive
I will check this method when I get home.,Vive
Maybe true but at least the Cosmos is Modular so it could be more future proof than others.  Time will tell I guess.,Vive
here come the Carmack-Terminator memes,Vive
"How did you film this? I know mixed reality videos, where you put the player into VR, but how do you put objects from VR into the real world?",Vive
You need to track the video camera and perform hand-eye calibration from the tracking to the camera coord system... Then just position the VR camera to the tracked video camera position and you can overlay video and rendered image,Vive
"'Facebook sucks, I'm going to build an ai that will end ~~skynet~~ Zuckerberg.'",Vive

A man like Carmack doesn't become a ""Gentleman scientist"" pottering around at home.  Not when you can be at thr front lines of technology and making a real difference.  Something's happen alright.",Vive
"Why is ca supposed to be bad?  Thats what I used a year ago without issues.  My only warning would be cover the lenses before using, it has a way of dripping where you dont want it to go.",Vive
Good point,Vive
"Tighten of tiny screw underneath the padding, that's all it is",Vive
It was very slightly loose... if this solves it I'm going to be THRILLED.,Vive
"The Cosmos right now, two months after release, it's still inferior to the Rift S on release day. Also the Cosmos problems might not boo solvable because of their choice of cameras (RGB vs IR/monochrome )",Vive
It fixed mine,Vive
none of that relates to vr.....,Vive
But B&amp;H says it does. Are you calling their advertising department liars?,Vive
someone announced a gta5 vr mod update today where u dont need vorpx and im justy holding my breath ittll carry over to rd soon oooooh buddy i want it,Vive
"Yeah i really want this and i was a better developer i'd make it because there are some aspects of hunting that can be brought into vr really well. For example, just keeping still and keeping quiet around animals, like when u go to draw your bow you cant do it too fast or itll spook the deer, so make sure thats the same in vr.",Vive
Nah I'd never accuse those nice people of lying,Vive
"I got one that way a few years ago.  
Great for watching netflix in void theater mode but that's about it.

I already had a vive and comparing them is not fair, but I never watch vr-video on the vive, the gearvr is much better for that. If I have one complaint it's that recentering your view when watching ""nature documentaries"" should be easier.",Vive

"I picked up a refurbised TPCast for Vive a few weeks ago.  As others have said, there's not a lot of support/help for it, but I had no problems setting it up.  I'm not using OpenTPCast yet, but even without whatever improvements that might add it's still a fun improvement over being cabled to your computer.  The Green bar at the side is a little annoying, but I quickly forget about it after getting immersed in a game.",Vive
"Well, the reason Gear VR can't is because it's not $2 cardboard. It's built to fit, as well as possible, the generation of Galaxy S and Note smartphones it released with. I think there are 4 or 5 versions. Gear VR is substantially higher quality than cardboard.",Vive
"He was also working for Facebook, probably constantly dealing with that ethical dilemma",Vive

"They sold cheaply or gave away millions.  They were not ""sticky"" and having used Google Daydream, I can understand why.",Vive
"Yeah this was a bit of an unfortunate oversight. Not to mention using the thing was tedious and was nothing more than a media viewer. The connector piece where the phone connects only fits your bare naked phone. You had to remove your phone case, and on some instances your screen protector if you used tempered glass. I literally shattered my screen protector once connecting it to the gear..

There's also the problem of dirty screens. Okay, simple, just wipe it clean before using right? No, you gotta clean the gear lenses both sides and the phone screen. But even that's not too big of a deal..BUT. Even after doing that, you could have missed one spec of dust and that shit is magnified in VR. You had to clean multiple times!",Vive

"Ok good to know... thank you.

I'll just have to give it a shot and see. I'm perfectly fine losing a little FOV for the benefits. I was afraid I'd be stuck with minimal FOV like clicking the distance all the way out to max. First time I tried vive was my cousin's and he had it set all the way out to cut down dizzyness for my grandmother... it was horrible...",Vive
"LOL.... ok... sounds like fixed is the way to go.

Thank you",Vive
"Yes.... From day 1, the Fresnel issues pissed me off. I had looked into swapping out for the google cardboard lenses early on just to find out that would NOT work... lol",Vive
"I bought the Cosmos, but sent it back because the Reverb has sooo much better resolution (better than most headsets actually). However, the Cosmos is not nearly as bad as a lot of people are making it out to be. It worked well enough in a lot of games. The only thing that I was annoyed with was getting messages for low light or too bright light. Those were lessened after updates. However, I could play stuff like Eleven ping pong and various other games without much issue. I did not use it for rifle shooting or bow and arrow games though. 
The pluses were a good screen, good colors, good sound, flip-up visor (no I never noticed much light getting in because of that), lots of room for glasses, comfort, manual ipd adjustment, decent refresh rate, decent controllers. 
I will say the small sweet spot was a tad annoying, but actually improved when I put glasses on, and the headphones were not easy to snap into place. 
If you need really solid tracking, it's not the headset to get right now. And really, the price is only really worth it if you plan to use wireless. But it is still cheaper than the Index without the wireless, and more portable too, so there's that. If they fix the tracking, then the headset becomes quite reasonable.",Vive
"I will do my best to not do so....

Do you think it would need to be a compressed can of air?... or would an industrial strength version work? LOL

I have a can of air you plug in that is basically a shop-vac motor in a can and a nozzle that BLASTS air out... Can clear an old tower of dust in seconds....",Vive
"Definitely going to give the 3.3 a try then.

Thank you for covering pretty much every point of question... it is VERY helpful.",Vive
return it you cant play any shooter games tracking sucks bad i own one. For stationary games its ok.,Vive

"I’ve had my Cosmos wireless adapter kit for a week now.  Overall I agree with mrtv’s review.  Easy to install and worked fine first time.

The short Headset cable is much too long.  It probably should be at least 30% shorter.  I found pulling some slack between the left headphone and visor helped get rid of most of the rear hanging slack.

The battery life is pretty short, for me about 1.5 hours.  Plus it took me 4 hours to recharge using a 5v/2A wall charger.  I have ordered a QC3.0 18w wall charger so this should speed up recharging and maybe give a deeper/fuller charge.  In any case I will need to source out an additional QC3.0 21W battery so I can do fast change outs.

While the performance of the wireless kit is very good it does use some cpu resources.  The only app that this causes a problem for me is with X Plane 11.  This is a very cpu intense sim and currently does not support multi threading.  Hopefully this will improve over the next few months as xp11 moves to Vulcan.  In the meantime I need to drop xp11 settings down quite a bit in order to maintain acceptable FPS.  I may try upping my current i9 9900k OC ( currently 5 GHz to maybe 5.1-5.2).  I may also increase my gtx1080ti OC (currently +80 core, +160 memory).

In summary I’m happy with my Wireless Cosmos and once Vive (and xp11 developers) sort out a few more issues I can envision this being my Go To VR headset.",Vive
"I ran this game with a 9900k and a 2080ti and performance was really poor.  Driving the car made me motion sick, this is only something that has happened to me maybe once in 3 years of VR gaming.  Do you expect to improve performance in the near future?",Vive
"What quality settings did you use? If you want stable 90 fps - you should be getting it on medium quite easily. 

We got far worse rigs in the office. Of course we see that the performance is far from perfect and will put a lot of effort to improve it significantly.

As for driving: there is an option to drive using touchpad/thumbstick and to lock pitch and roll while driving - this should help a lot with motion sickness.",Vive
"Hmmmm....are you mad because I was being sarcastic or are you worried you’ve never actually been funny....seems like this one is on you.....""buddy"".",Vive
seems like you're projecting,Vive
Would you mind going over the method for doing this?,Vive
"from the PC end there is no issue besides maybe latency.... though  I doubt say 100 ms would matter for data reporting.

&amp;#x200B;

can't speak for the IOS ecosystem.... I would assume its do-able... just depends if its locked down by apple or  not..... That being said I don't know of a a ready made solution. i.e. get programming.",Vive

Yeah was wondering if it's any good since the vive das are 100$,Vive
How has the tracking been?,Vive

Hmm interesting.. I have made a decision on the Rift S tho since the price is confirmed to drop on black Friday to I believe 350. So I'll be getting the Rift s,Vive
Question: can you please gift me the game?,Vive
"Mine lost its haptics due (I think) to a whack on the furniture when playing Gorn. I think it's due to a broken connector, and is not an easy fix. You can google it.


 I've learned to live without haptics on one hand...",Vive
But where can I find a VR power cable?,Vive
"I bought one for Quest. I'm not sure if this is the same, but on picture certainly looks like it is. I paid much more than $25... around $70. For that price it certainly wasn't worth it. The build quality of Quest strap is bad. Apply too much pressure and it will break. Also, Quest is very front heavy and it would require much more ergonomic halo strap to be comfortable (if it would work at all). As it is, it doesn't come close to Rift S level of comfort. It made my forehead hurt in around 15 minutes of use and I went back to my original strap + studioform strap setup right away. It's much better.

Again, I was using it for Quest, so I have no idea how well it works for Vive (I believe it's less front-heavy than Quest). For $25 it might just be worth it to give it a try.",Vive
HTC still haven't fixed the many problems. Not worth buying at the asking price.,Vive

Oh wow. So there is a pattern.  I have stopped dealing with their customer service because like I said it's a waste of time. If you used a credit card just raise a dispute at least while you wait. I got refunded by credit card company for now. HTC is shocking and a  disgrace!,Vive
"Yes, the Vive Pro and the Cosmos both need an adapter kit with the proprietary short cable (same cable currently being shipped for Pro and Cosmos adapter kits).  The Cosmos also needs the higher wattage battery but that battery will also work for the Pro and OG Vive.  The adapter kits also come with head strap padding for the area where the adapter attaches (different pads for Pro vs Cosmos). 

Probably be a pain to detach and reattach the wireless to the top of the headset so I would not want to do it on a regular basis, but if you have the right cables, mounts, and batteries should be doable.",Vive

"Well it's about time!  I think one of the most underutilitized tools VR has to offer is the haptic feedback.  I was somewhat thrilled when I saw a company [Immersion](https://www.immersion.com/technology/) working on software called Haptic Studio, but never really saw something generally available for hobby developers.

What would be nice is to have a collection of tried and true haptic assets that can be applied to various interactions within a VR application.

I remember one of the best experiences with haptic feedback was Valve's original VR tutorial for SteamVR;  the haptic sensation when blowing up balloons was surreal.

I would definitely like to know how they are creating their haptics and if this particular Unity add-in will help achieve similar results.",Vive

"Yeah, I‘ve suggested the same thing in the past. If Valve or Facebook want better use of haptics in games they should consider compiling a library of quality haptic samples. 

It might have the effect that many games would end up using the same haptics for various actions, but I think samey high-quality haptics would be a big step up from low-quality haptics or none at all, and for anyone wanting to create something new it would serve as an example.",Vive

Index Valve support?,Vive
It's been awhile since I tested it on PC but I dont see why it would stop working,Vive
Comfort and picture are better on PSVR. Tracking and immersion are twice as good on Vive.,Vive
"I love my original Vive, but I wouldn't really recommend it unless you've got a fair bit of money to spend on top of the cost of the headset. The deluxe audio strap ($100), wireless adapter ($300), Gear VR lens swap ($50), plus an extra battery for the wireless ($30) adds up to more than a brand new Rift S costs. Plus tripods and swivel mounts if you don't have a good place to mount the base stations on the wall (or if you rent and aren't allowed to damage the walls).

That said, the headset is pretty great with those modifications. If you're not going to go with all the bells and whistles then I might be considering the Rift S.",Vive

"I just read your comments in the Steam discussion, and they basically made me lose all hope for the game, after having waited anxiously for it since it was announced. The reason I want to play VR table tennis is that I like – and am good at – real table tennis, but I only have the opportunity to play it a couple of times a year.

Now, I care deeply about visuals and presentation, but I'd **much** rather play a 100% physically accurate table tennis simulation in a white box than some pretty game that has paddles and a ball but doesn't feel or work like real table tennis. From what you've written, this seems to be 180 degrees from your preferences.

I hope that their announced updates will improve things, but to be honest I think that if they cared about accurate physics, then they wouldn't have released a game that was far from the goal.",Vive
So the rift s has better resolution?,Vive
"Thankfully OpenVR Advanced Settings lets you heavily tweak the behavior of the chaperone. For small spaces I suggest setting it so the grid shows up closer than normal, but also shows up sooner if you're moving faster. And the proximity vibration is a real controller/wall saver!",Vive

Roomscale definitely is best with basically a completely empty room. I have a similar spot that I use and I'm constantly hitting stuff.

I couldn't check it on the Steam page. I was to lazy. But I knew that at least one person will tell me... :*,Vive
"Yes, but at a lower framerate.

I have to decide between a normal HTC Vive and A Rift S so wich one would you recommend?,Vive
It's Harare!,Vive
"Yes, we got full finger tracking, these are the best controllers to play Thief Simulator VR :)",Vive
Unfortunately the base game was made with only multiplayer in mind and it would have be programmed almost from scratch to add multiplayer.,Vive
"The Rift S is good, if you also plan to have portability say going on vacation, going to a friends house etc.

But if you don't see yourself doing that, I would honestly just pick the Vive, especially if you can get it on sale as well. Definitely pick up the Deluxe Audio Strap - that thing is basically a necessity.

A lot of people don't seem to mention this, but you can use the Valve Index Knuckles controllers and then get the Index at a later date. The lighthouses that come with the Vive work with the Knuckles/Index.

So if I was to buy a headset knowing this, I would still opt for the Vive. As Output mentioned, definitely get the GearVR lenses at an absolute minimum before upgrading. - it makes the halo effect very minimal while making things easier to read, along with better clarity.


TL;DR - Get the Vive, consider the GearVR lense mod at a minimum. Upgrade to the Valve Knuckles controllers and then if you're still invested into VR, upgrade to the Index and keep your lighthouses.",Vive
"If money isn't important, the Pro is a definite upgrade from the OG Vive. I went from an OG to a Pro and it's nice. The Vive Pro has certain advantages over the Index but the Index also has certain advantages over the Vive Pro. I got my Pro before Index was even announced.

I can't comment on wireless or eye tracking as I only have the normal Pro and not the wireless kit or Pro Eye model.",Vive
"Works, but with issues. This was a leaked custom build which was not approved by the developer max vollmer. Propper Beta will come soonish.",Vive
Half-Life VR 4 Quest - r/Lambda1VR,Vive
It's insane how well the game plays in VR,Vive
Did a quick Google search a looked at the reviews. Seems they're very bad quality and won't last long.,Vive
Oculus Rift s or valve index. Fuck vive,Vive
"I assume an index is out of your price range? If you have tried the PSVR and know that you like VR, I would suggest that if you can afford it. I went for a Vive as a relatively cheap entry point to try out VR and ensure I like it enough, while ensuring that I could upgrade to any better steamVR based headset in the future without having to buy new sensors and controllers. If you don't care about that upgrade path, then the Rift S isn't a bad idea. If you are going with Oculus though, I would wait and see how the Quest Link turns out. If that is good, then you might be better off getting a Quest than the Rift S.",Vive
"I've had my Vive for years now and still love it. You don't NEED the DAS (I prefer using good quality earbuds instead) but some people like the comfort. But I did add the tpcast wireless a couple years ago and could never go back to wired. It's a huge improvement. I also have a Pimax but I don't play it as much because I'd rather have smaller FOV but be able to be wireless. I have a large play area though so in a small area it might not matter as much.

My sister has the PSVR &amp; Vive is definitely better.",Vive
[an old post of mine about this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/a6v6nu/my_base_station_has_the_blinking_red_light_of/ebydwhf/?st=k2xkkzur&amp;sh=97d22ff9) telling you how to physically check.,Vive
"From having used a Vive for almost six months and being an Oculus CV1 user for more than a year:

Cons:

Comfort wise if you dont buy the DAS is pretty lame...

Controls are day and night worse than Oculus... (you can buy a pair of Index controllers but that adds to the total cost with already is elevated)

You have to set up the lighthouses and you cannot use the Vive in other place unless do the same setup in that place (wich can be tedious). This compared with te Rift S wich have no external sensors.

It have more Screendor Effect (due to the wider FOV I think), and the Sweet Spot is worse thank Oculus CV1 (and in the Rift S is better)

Pros:

Tracking is excelent (hadn't tryed Rift S to compare)

FOV is wider, this is a plus to immersion and the thing that I noticed first when I bought my Oculus CV.

&amp;#x200B;

I think OG Vive was a great first VR device with some drawbacks, but this days with more devices in the market i dont think is a good purchase.",Vive
"Really? I've never tried the PSVR, but based on specs it looks like the vive should give a better image. I guess the PSVR might have better lenses?",Vive
"Thanks, I would consider the Index but since going wireless, I simply can't find it in myself to go back to all of those cables again.",Vive
"I was able to get the trend-net going.. the 4m of total length is going to work just fine for me.   I did read your about your battle though!

Now of course -- I'm hitting another issue.  CPU usage.  My old xeon processor can't keep up with the compression during games like Skyrim.  Works fine for beat saber, and others.. (only once I set the compositor process to real time)..   but skyrim (and I assume others) are blocky.   Upgrading just for skyrim is a bit much -- and the kids mostly play the games that work.  So I might just live with it and upgrade the computer opportunistically.",Vive
thx,Vive
PSVR image is surprisingly good. The SDE is much reduced compared to the Vive.,Vive
Well done; I enjoyed the hell out of it.,Vive
"Honestly its still worth trying just for the sake of it. It actually works so well, probably the best VR experience (in terms of functionality and general immersion) I've had.",Vive
i watched gameplay. not a fan of the floating storage boxes,Vive
"It's functional but very rough. The author himself does not recommend that anyone play it, an updated version is in the works.",Vive
I will put it on my overpopulated list,Vive
"I know my stated practical experience with both headsets seems over-simplified, but I am telling you: PSVR all day for comfort and visuals if I had a choice over Vive. I don't notice SDE the way I do with the OG Vive; the colors of each pixel are very separated. Vive is by far my least favorite headset to look through, but obviously the best to track if I'm doing something like mixed reality capture or TiltBrush recording. Original elastic straps make it unnecessarily front-heavy and with the Deluxe Audio strap, while it's greatly improved, it's too much weight vs PSVR for me personally (6'2"", big noggin). So if I'm sitting in to watch a movie or a live YouTube broadcast, I will sit on the couch with PSVR. We did not mention the Quest, but Quest is my favorite headset with the Delxue Audio Strap fused on. Wireless freedom is what's missing from PSVR. 
I halfway expect a reply that the specs you see seem to outweigh my practical experience, but nevertheless, that's what I think.",Vive
"Yeah this is more like the first game but with vastly Improved physics.  If you're a fan of the first game or are a fan of table tennis games in general you will like this.  I play all table tennis games (even flat ones)  they all feel different to me.  

Fun factor comes from the immersion and realism not just the physics.  The main thing I need is from the physics is for it to be fun and for the game to have Depth.",Vive
"If you don’t have a PC VR set right now, I can assure you that you’ll be satisfied with the Vive if you do choose to purchase it. Definitely research into which VR headset is best though.

Also, I highly recommend adding Hotdog Horseshoes and Handgrenades (H3VR) to your list of games. It’s single player only but I find it infinitely more fun than Pavlov and Zero Caliber. I really only play it and Blade and Sorcery

Pavlov is a fun and good game, especially if you’re playing TTT, but Zero Caliber doesn’t seem great from what I’ve played of the demo",Vive
"Yep this worked thanks :)

I started my game in photon but I only want LAN multiplayer as players will be in the same space, I noticed photon has a small amount of lag so not sure if this is the way to go for me as they don't support LAN only, do you think its worth me proceeding with photon or do you have any other recommendations?",Vive
"I personally think Photon cannot be beat.

Networked multiplayer is hard and lag is inevitable, even in LAN, and I'd point to Rec Room as proof that Photon can be used to achieve any level of polish necessary.",Vive
No idea what that means but you’re missing out if you don’t try it.,Vive
"Yea, I was going to say, vivecraft has been for me the state for what all other vr mods/ports should baseline themselves. Especially the damn keyboard.",Vive
reloading the gun i mean. had to look it up again lol. but yeah the reloading system is so immersion breaking for me,Vive
"I don't recommend the original vive. It has the WORST visuals out of all VR headsets I have tried by a wide margin.

Seriously. Once you've tried others, it's night and day.

If you want something cheap, get an oculus. If you can stretch higher, I recommend the Pimax, and if you want the absolute pinnacle right now, the valve Index.

Note: There is no perfect VR headset out there right now (but damn, the valve index is close). Each has its strengths and weaknesses, so please PLEASE ask this question on other vr subs (like r/oculus r/SteamVR or r/Pimax) ; each sub is full of fans who will defend their headset of choice to the death and obstinately deny any flaws it has, so its important you get a better view of the playing field, and really listen to the particular strengths and weaknesses of each)",Vive
"I like mine.  I just have the regular vive, got it used for lower cost (~300USD) and tracking is sweet, screen door effect is there but it’s okay if you don’t have to focus on a fine detail.

I mainly do asseto corsa in VR, but Gorn, Skyrim, and VTOL VR, and Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades (aka H3VR) are awesome as well.

H3VR is the best gun-game I’ve played.",Vive
"I'm surprised you included this version of GTAV VR. There was a version that worked with motion controllers, including actually aiming to shoot and teleportation for those with motion sickness issues.",Vive
"Maybe I linked the wrong one. A lot going on for this video, I will double check. Please send me the other mod link",Vive
"After I tried the PCVR version, I would have agreed with you. The game is about crouching, jumping, etc... didn't think it would really adapt to VR well as anything but a tour down memory lane. 

Then I played the Quest version. There is a jump and crouch button, which deals with the biggest UI challenge adapting a traditional FPS. Then we have a reach-behind-your-back to grab the crowbar, swing to smash, aim down the iron sights, physically throw grenades ... it's pretty damn smooth. My only complaint is switching weapons is done through cycling the entire inventory with a thumbstick; that's slow and tedious. But it almost feels like a native VR game.",Vive
"I've had the OG Vive since release. I love it. Easily way better than PSVR in many ways.  If I were buying today I would get the index. I want the Index, I'm saving for the upgrade. I could buy the controllers first and the headset later. The OG lighthouses will work so I don't need to replace them right away. The only way I can see buying the Vive today would be if it was stupid cheap, like used.",Vive
Looks like you lost the Duke Nukem details as well,Vive
No it's there. This is the Duke nukem serious sam mod. It's at the end. You just need the stea. Workshop files,Vive
"Sure! Sharing the vive wands, and I oriented the view of pistolwhip on the quest to match, then figured out the delay in order to start the vive and quest at the same time. No fail is on the quest since I'm technically not shooting any of those guys, just using them as a reference for where to point the vive. You can almost accomplish with Virtual desktop, but the minute the vive looks to the right, I cannot see guys coming from the left.",Vive
"HTC and Valve have messed around with multiple lighthouses syncing together. The Lighthouse 2.0 can support 100sq meter with 4. They have experimented with 16 at a time which theoretically 400sq m. Look into it but, you may find something.",Vive
"IMO if you're the only one using the DAS it's less comfortable (barely), but if you're swapping the headset among people, the DAS is wonderful.",Vive

Glad you enjoyed it,Vive
not in a laptop.,Vive
"I heard this, but until bootcamp explicitly supports that functionality I couldn't seeing considering investing in the time and expense of tuneing up that pipeline.",Vive
Does that version still work to your knowledge? The main known one with vorpx doesn't work anymore. I found another but don't want to mess with my working mod for motion controls for nothing,Vive
The DAS is a really nice upgrade for an OG Vive and worth every penny imo. The rest is up to you.,Vive
"It's good dude. 
As it compares to psvr;  
  
Tracking is more accurate and has less latancy.  
Roomscale is a game changer.  

The only downside is coming from psvr you will notice the screen door effect.  
  
I suggest trying before you buy if you can. I think most vrcades use vives.  
  
For games my recommendation is Sierento",Vive

"Just bought, any tips before playing?",Vive
"It required VorpX, so it's probably that one. It's a shame it doesn't work anymore. That was an amazing mod.",Vive
Jedi Knights 2 has a mod as well I believe,Vive
But a sofa isn't easy to glue together,Vive
Eye in the Sky,Vive
I would even settle for a Github repository where people can share them.  I'm not sure if Valve made any available in their SDKs; I didn't specifically look for any though.,Vive
Brutal Doom VR  - amazing!,Vive
I haven't tried the jedi knight mod and when I googled it I kept finding the linux version,Vive

This game is more fun though and looks 1000x better.",Vive
"^ This! 

Your other option is to divide the area up into 3x3m cubicles, with walls or sheets between to prevent the lighthouses interfering with each other. This also eliminates the problem of people potentially hurting each other. 

Also, look up Zero Latency in Australia. They do a warehouse scale zombie shooter with multiple players. They used to use Razer headsets, I believe, but fairly recently changed the tech, so I’m not sure what they use now.",Vive
"I would also like to know his questions.  People who have done the upgrade, was it worth as of today?",Vive
No Skyrim VR? Talos VR? Subnautica? Redout? Doom VFR? LA Noire? Elite Dangerous?,Vive

I didn’t. Watching Last Week Tonight :),Vive
HTC are starting to look more and more like an abusive partner when it comes to their VR customers. Facebook and Valve both treat their customers better so why continue to give HTC your money?,Vive
"If you've got to buy both a Windows PC *and* a VR headset, I think you're better off buying a PS4 slim for ~400$ and a PSVR for ~420$.

"I'm not going to fill it out because I'm a bit tired of lackluster surveys that are all over the VR subreddits. I'm just going to point out that so far there is no treadmill on the market that one would be likely to NOT have in a permanent setup. I've personally moved Virtuix Omnis and Katwalk Minis and they are both in the hundreds of pounds. Even if you were to develop something that didn't rely on leaning/pulling on the structure to keep you in place, like the actual motion detecting walking treadmill a team has been working on for *years*, the device will still have to be heavy enough to resist tipping should a user reach a restraint, and change the center of gravity.

The fact that you ask about whether someone would regularly rearrange their playspace to bring a treadmill out of storage tells me you know very little about that product space.",Vive
"If I remember correctly from doing similar repairs, the same cable that handles the haptics handles the trackpad input signals. It's a good thing they didn't break the whole cable.",Vive
So could an ametur fix it? I have unsteady hands so getting it fixed might be a challenge.,Vive
"Also, no one who is so into VR that they would buy a treadmill on top of their computer and headset wouldn't have a dedicated play space.",Vive
Do you have any other peripheral connected? I used to get weird stutters if my G29 wheel was connected at the same time as my vive wands on some apps.,Vive

How could the standard cable work for you if wireless +2 meters isn't?,Vive
"I bought one for my Vive, back in the days.

It was good... and it cost me hundret more than what you have to pay now... and yes, it was worth it (If these are not cheap chinese knockoffs you are seeing) as it enhances the comfort of the Vive while wearing as well as the audio quality a lot. The Vive is also much easier to put off and on with the strap. 

... btw, your link that you provided seems to be the wrong one.",Vive
Do you have Afterburner or something similar with a GPU monitor running in the background?  Have you checked your CPU / GPU usage in-headset to see if anything is happening there that seems related?  Any reflexive surfaces in the room?,Vive
"I'm not a fan of Facebook, but saying it ""killed"" the company is a bit much. The main brains of the old Oculus (Carmack and Abrash) are still there. The ones that went away had different vision for the path Oculus should take- cutting edge PC VR. Now, it's all subjective, but I really like the new approach that Oculus is taking: affordable, but still quality PC VR hmd and mainstream pushing mobile VR, that I think is the right way forward for VR.

For cutting edge PC VR you have Valve and (to some degree) hmds like HP Reverb, etc.

You can also say whatever you want about walled gardens, but the truth is, Oculus and Sony are the only 2 companies that are actually investing in VR software and try to bring more complex games to VR.",Vive
"I don't think you are answering the OP's question. We all know the genuine DAS is worth it, the OP is on about these alternative cheap versions and has anyone had any experience with these cheap ones **Not experience with the genuine DAS**",Vive
"Only if you're very, very good (and experienced) at soldering very small wires. You cannot repair the ribbon cable, but it's possible to open the haptic motor, solder 2 wires in there and then there's 2 solder joints on the ribbon cable, but you have to use really thin wires due to the lack of space in there.",Vive
"I don't know if this makes a difference but I really think one of the questions should be: would you buy one. All these questions are based off of the fact that we own one. The ""would you move around your space or leave it where it was"" question doesn't have an answer to say if anyone would wanna buy it and therefore your data is going to be in accurate as people have to chose between to things that they may neither want.",Vive
Very detailed and well reasoned analysis. I agree with all your points.,Vive

Always stop Afterburner before playing VR.,Vive

Thanks,Vive
Steam VR and a recent upload VR article,Vive
"&gt;  I dont want to support valve by buying an index.

You know..you could just say ""I don't want to buy an Index"" but you had to push an agenda. Once that is about to backfire in your face as well. 

You buy an original Vive, it's built with Valve tech and will only work with SteamVR. Sure you can use Viveport and get ReVive so you can use Oculus home but then what? There will always be games that only release on Steam. Even if you buy a WinMR headset instead, Microsoft has a partnership with Valve for game support. 

One way or another, you buy anything but a Rift-S / Quest or content outside of Oculus home, you will be supporting Valve in some manner.

So by your own ""I don't want to support Valve"" comment, you've locked yourself into one choice of headset and one choice of store front only.  Have fun with that because Oculus want to be as exclusive and locked in as theyt can be anyway and Facebook seem like such good guys with their end users best interests as their number one agenda... right?",Vive
this is on viveport right?,Vive
I couldnt find that info when I looked,Vive
"I recently got the real vive deluxe audio strap and it is amazing. You might want to post in r/hardwareswap to see if you can find a cheaper used one but I feel it’s worth the money.

Also you can’t really understand how much of a convenience it is to be able to take off and on your headset in just one piece until you have it",Vive
"The revert feature in the Space Fix tab is more than just resetting you back to the offsets center point. It restores your whole chaperone setup to the way it was when you started your vr session.

\- disassembly stolen cars, hack phones and tablets in your hideout; and sell all goods in a pawn shop or by online  
\- buy new thief tools and gadgets that will allow you to rob richer people  
\- drive cars with fully implemented VR-adapted driving model and play with a car interior  
or  just… follow a plot and pay off a debt to a mysterious family or choose by yourself which house you will rob next in this free roam sandbox  world.

Thief  Simulator VR is not a short VR game. We estimate that production can be  completed in 10 hours, but when we consider the freedom of what players  can do in this world - some can spend up to 100 hours on this title.  Price? Only $15. 

Thief  Simulator VR has its premiere today. We decided that we want to spend  this time here as well because the Reddit community eagerly commented on  our recordings from early versions of the game and suggested  interesting tips. Here we are! Let's start AMA!",Vive

No it makes you a boner.,Vive
"Hi guys, looking forward to playing this when I get my VR soon, are you going to add ways to distract and subdue the npcs you are robbing? For example adding the ability to spike npcs drinks or food with sleeping pills, and being able to hide their bodies so you don't alert the other npcs. Or even being able to go behind and choke someone out, being able to hack cctv cameras, disable them etc. Basically making it sort of similar to hitman w/o killing ppl :D, I think adding loads more mechanics like these will really help the replay-ability factor. Also are you planning on adding logitech g920 support?",Vive
"Hi,

there is a lot of progress e.g., you can hack alarms, crack safes use windows cutters. But, it's not like Hitman. You rather observe tennats, gather data and try to rob the house when they are out.
As to the steering wheel support, we will see how many people really wants it - it might be a little dangerous moving around racing rig with HMD on ;p",Vive
Bet,Vive
Price?,Vive
"How long does the entire game take to complete?
Is it a hello neighbor-type vibe?
Is there a video I can watch?
(At school rn and stem store is blocked so I can’t check)",Vive
I wouldn't expect to get any content updates for a $10 game so I guess this confirms my belief a little haha,Vive
"you should make a game mode / expansion / dlc for organized heists with diff roles

i would love to be the getaway driver",Vive
"I could be mistaken, but any sort of separate sound card is just not needed unless you are an audio professional and realllllly need every ounce of quality.",Vive
$15 and there is a launch discount -10%.,Vive
"If someone beats the game under 10 hours, I am going to congratulate him myself. Adding the replayability it should be 20-50 hours.

the bugs will be fixed,Vive

I don't extend the cable but I get the most out of the included cable by using this arm mounted to my desk vs. clipping it to the monitor.

"Hey, I was in on the beta about mid way through. This was one of the few VR games that has ever made me sick though I admit I didn’t report it because I wasn’t really sure how or why it was making me sick and I moved on to other things. Did other beta testers report that, and how far has the game come since the beta for improving that issue?

Thanks for making this port of the game, letting me participate in the beta, and of course doing this AMA.",Vive
"Ok, thanks!",Vive
"The also sell VR power supplies, VR ram, VR video cards and VR cpu's. 

Is this an ad for B&amp;H Photo?",Vive
"This trailer doesn’t really sell me, but that’s probably because I’ve already seen all the features that it shows off.  For me the entirely themeless environment/enemies concern me.  Supposedly it’s got a full campaign though?",Vive
I keep forgetting that not every HMD has the guardian system on Quest and Rift S.  It’s fucking  awesome,Vive
"""Get the best VR certified display monitor for your PC, only at B&amp;H!"" 

Companies cashing in on the fact that common sense isn't that common.",Vive
"Looks great! I don't have the time right now, but at this price I'll definitely pick up soon and try it.",Vive
Fucking take my upvote.,Vive
Going in with the inevitable will this come to Quest post ? ;),Vive
"cAn I gEt A kEy?

Did one of your VR sets break while making the port?",Vive
"Hi,

if you mean early beta. Than we have improved in every area including performance, anti-motion-sickness options and ""easiness"" (is that a word?) of play.

We still continue to work on these area of course, since there is are for improvement. You can always refund the game if you don't like it or it makes you puke :)

Here are comforting solutuibs that we have:

TUNNELING [all options in Graphics tab]:

You can turn on and off anti-motion-sickness effect Tunneling separately for:
Tunnelling during walking
Tunnelling during rotating
Tunneling on window leap
Tunnelling effect coverage - additionally you can set the sensitivity of the effect

LOCOMOTION [all options in Movement tab]:

We provided you also with many locomotion options (Touchpad/thumbstick, Armswing, Headboob, Teleport)
Additionaly, when moving with touchpad/thumbstick you can choose whether you will walk accordingly to head, body or controller direction. The speed of movement increases linearly with thumbstick/touchpad input.
If you feel like the touchpad/thumbstick movement is still too fast you can use Walking speed factor [0.2:1]


DRIVING:

Control steering wheel with thumbsitck / touchpad [Settings]- should be easier on your stomach and it easier to master.

Lock pitch and roll when driving [Gameplay] - should help you a lot while driving. You won’t feel like being on a rollercoaster",Vive
I wanna VR gaming chair!,Vive
"Cool! Thanks again, it seems like a great game and that was my one hang up.",Vive
"Noo, we just sit comfortably mostly development. Headsets are fine, if we need to test something more agressive, we use Index controllers - they stick to the hand ;p",Vive
So I saw BenPlaysVR his review of the game and it looked REALLY good. But will the game get more updates? And that it isnt like 2 months of updates and then its done?,Vive
I will never understand how such a big company can just leave their essential software in such a garbage state,Vive
"We really wish, but it's a 99% no. We would have to program game and make 3D models from scratch to be able run it on Quest Specs and still... I am not sure we would've make it. This was a flat game and there are things like dynamic day-night cycle, which is really a bottleneck when porting to mobile devices.",Vive
Ah no drama I will be using the index to play it just loving the quest for traveling ;),Vive
"The game is already released on Early Access, and we keep improving it with weekly updates. So we'll launch as soon as we have the game fully ready!",Vive
With the oculus link coming out you should reconsider.,Vive
Tpcast only works with of five not five pro.,Vive
"Hi, 

there were many developers who dropped their projects, even though they promised long support. So you don't have to trust me :) We have a very perspective game with a very long gameplay (for VR) which needs some polish. We should have more resources now, after release if everything goes as planned. We want to continue our work with community as we did during 3 months beta testing and apply your feedback.

P.S. We have some patches/add-ons ready, but they need some testing :)",Vive
"There shouldn't be a problem with the Quest via link, since game is run on PC.",Vive
Oh cool. I wasn’t 100% sure how that worked.,Vive
"Is there any way that we can get this on Steam another way? Like, does Steam ever leave the door unlocked or is there a way to hack in and get a copy of the game that costs a little less than the full version, like maybe 100% less, but still has all the features of the full version? Or does the simulation only start once you’ve paid real money for the game?",Vive
can i get a free code? lol,Vive
Congrats on your release!,Vive
Amazing buying it as soon as I get home,Vive
Thanks!,Vive
Oh my gosh yes theif simulator VR gonna play this right away!,Vive
I’m happy you have a teleport option. Thank you. Is there an option to skip driving scenes like in L.A. Noire vr in case that causes motion sickness?,Vive
I hope you'll get home safely ^ ^,Vive
"Currently no and unfortunately I can't promise you that'll be - since we didn't talk about it yet and it would interfere with gameplay a lot.

But, you can steer the car with touchpad/thumbstick and lock pitch and roll while driving - it should be much easier on your stomach ;)",Vive
Oculus Quest? Support for logitech racing wheel?,Vive
"On the first mission, how the hell do I buy the lockpick? I grabbed the  cash, and now ive explored all the rooms I can, but I have no idea how to get the locklpick from my buy wheel",Vive
"Oh no we are so sorry you, Random Reddit Guy, thinks our post was directed completely and totally at one individual...YOU! Should we back up and delay release until you have time? Just kidding, because no one cares.",Vive
"That means you need a PC capable of running a VR game, just fyi.",Vive
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Vive
"Hi, you buy lockpick in your house on computer (in Tool4Thieves). I am almost sure that Vinny told you this :)",Vive
"Yea definitely do. I have a vive and rift I just really enjoy being wireless lol

But if I can just install a usb c cable overhead to hang down that would be ideal.",Vive
lol wut,Vive
"Best Mario-like kart game for VR to date.  Good job.  Not sure how to turn off the menu girl's jibberishy speech though, lol!",Vive
Nice will check out. My daughters will love this.,Vive
"Nice ping pong sim.  I esp. love that it is included with my Infinity subscription, nice one!  Thanks.",Vive
What's your take on an Oculus Quest port or spin off?,Vive
"calm down buddy, its just a joke",Vive
"I do not find Afterburner to be a problem with my gtx1080ti.  I only use a minor gpu overclock though so maybe that helps (+80 core, +160 memory).  I mainly use it to set a custom fan curve to help keep things noce and cool.  I will admitt that Afterburner did not work well with my older AW 17r4 laptop in VR so probably worth disabling it to see if this helps.",Vive
You’ll eed to theif one,Vive
Got the notification from steam this was out. Added to wish lost as need to build a new PC so Vive is stored away.,Vive
now thats funny,Vive
Wow great news so theres a chance it'll have a player base for multi.,Vive
"NOTE: after looking up your board, you only have one M.2 slot. This means that you will have to use SATA SSD/hard drive. Make sure you have enough space in your case to stash at least one drive. I’m saying this because you are going for a ITX build. 


That said, your Mobo does appear to have x4 gen 3 PCIe wired to it, and it will not take bandwidth from you x16 gen 3 PCIe GPU slot.",Vive
"Every WiGig solution I've heard of uses a PCI-E solution. I think that if it was going to exist, they would have launched it with it first hand. I doubt that HTC will come out with any sort of hardware revisions for the product. 

Every person I've seen comment about trying it out in an EGPU situation has commented that it either doesn't work or it works extremely poorly with lots of dropped frames and such. 

Regarding my personal experience with the product, in my system (good enough to run a Vive Pro/Index (90fps mode) at 90fps for most VR games), I have noticeable compression issues with when trying to use it with the Vive Pro. With the OG Vive however, it works quite flawlessly. I will say though that I didn't get great performance until I put it in the top-most PCI-E slot I had on my motherboard. How your CPU and Motherboard deals with PCI bandwidth is really important for the Vive Wireless adapter.",Vive
Cool. I'll have to check it out when I get the chance,Vive
"Great Written guide here for those who dont want to watch the video

[https://bsaber.com/pistol-whip-scoring-guide/](https://bsaber.com/pistol-whip-scoring-guide/)

There are a few extra details in the video like how the armour works and certain symbols next to your scores which arent in the written guide so It may still be worth checking out if you have already seen the written one.

Let me know if I have missed anything out.",Vive
"Just making sure, a lot of people don't seem to realize that just plugging it in isn't good enough. I might even put it on Oculus for not making people aware enough.",Vive
"the first mission dropped me into the front yard of someones house, I didnt see/have a computer.",Vive
"Touring karts works with all the wheels. Check the second video of the steam store ;)
About Quest: “maybe” it’s not confirmed",Vive
"If you completed it, go to the car. Drive to the edge of map. Go to the house and there you can buy lockpicks. If you have stuff to sell, you can sell in Pawn Shop (if it's TV sell it on computer on BlackBay)",Vive
I'll find some youtubers video who beats the tutorial and send you here in a minute,Vive
Omg it’s so helpful thanks,Vive

Probably not,Vive
Now I have something to spend money on,Vive
"I dunno, are they animal skeletons? N' I mean sure furries would be obsessed with animal skeletons, but I guess there's nothing wrong with that. Unless they start sexualizing those too.. Lol.",Vive
Im just seeing the right and bottom no dots like I do on my other one.,Vive
Payday 2 has VR support if you want that sort of thing,Vive
"Hi! I am stoked this is released! I have been following it ever since I bought it on the switch, my question is this the switch version is extremely lacking in updates vs the pc version, no junkyard/van etc. What is included in this version and will you plan on updating it regularly?",Vive
"That would be the problem. 

The dots are strobe LEDs that are used for synchronization between the lighthouses and indicating the beginning of a laser sweep. They're rather critical to the operation of the 1.0 lighthouses.

Guess you know why you got a deal on them now.

Normally I'd say it would be time to contact the manufacturer, but I wouldn't get my hopes up with HTC.",Vive
"Yes, we will have new updates. In term of content currently we have the same things as flat Thief on release, we will be adding new content during Early Access.",Vive
"These look like they're designed to be halo straps like wmr, rift S, Cosmos. Not a DAS.",Vive
"Just got a wireless today -- yeah -- it really wants a faster CPU then I have.  :(   Skyrim is blechy..   Some other games are a bit better with the compositor set to real time.  

I had hoped to avoid upgrading my CPU..  it is an old XEON with low ghz and lots of cores.. it just ain't cutting it anymore.    What MB did you go with that had space for the pci-e slot?",Vive
Get one with magnets. Easier to put it back on.,Vive
It has the good magnets. It's just me getting used to where to put it. Won't take long to get used to it I imagine.,Vive
