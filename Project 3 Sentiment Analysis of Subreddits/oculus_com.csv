As most of you know I am a bit old school and came up playing games like the original Doom, Quake and Unreal so when the devs reached out to me to see if I wanted to give their game an early look I jumped at the chance! 

Theta legion was originally created for the Oculus Go but will soon be released for the Rift and possibly will also make its way to the Quest. The game is tentatively set for release on 12/5 in the Oculus store so if you like what you see here tonight be sure to look for it then! \[\]-)

Theta Legion as described by the developers:

Theta Legion is a new, exciting, and immersive fast-paced VR first person shooter for the Oculus Rift.

Inspired by classics such as Doom and Quake, Theta Legion has a unique style including a blend of pixel-art textures, 3D environments and 2D sprites.

You play as a member of the Space Foreign Legion sent to investigate planets and space stations and clear all the threats you may encounter.

A repair assesses the integrity of your current installation, and will add or upgrade any missing files from the database.

Please temporarily disable any antivirus you have installed on your PC when completing this step. Doing this will allow us to rule out any permissions issues related to your anti-virus or accidental prevention of Oculus installation files downloading. Do not forget to re-enable when you're done.

90,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"I get where you're coming from. In honor of Witcher TV show on Netflix in a few weeks, I'm replaying Witcher games, and Witcher 3 is BRUTALLY long. Amazing, wonderfully written, but long. So very, very long. However, on the flipside, you have games like Fisherman's Tale, that is over in 60-90 mins. 

My problem with VR games is that most are WAY less than 10 hrs. They're in 4-6 hr range. As such, they need to be priced accordingly. It's not cool when VR game devs are exploiting the enthusiasts who are so starved for any new content that they will purchase any 4 hr piece of crap for $30. In the meantime, you have absolute gems on flatscreen market priced well below $20, and lasting 2-3x as long. Mark of the Ninja, for example, was roughly $15 at launch, iirc, and took 8-10 hrs. That's much more reasonable.

So, do I mind short games? Not at all. Though, in all honesty, if I have to learn a new and complex ruleset, or any intricacies, in a game that lasts 5 hrs, I won't bother, it's not worth the time to learn it for such a short experience. Luckily, in VR, this is a lot less of an issue because controls are usually very intuitive, with the exception of abominations like Fallout 4 VR. But they have to be priced lower given what they're offering. If it's going to be amateur hour, keep it under $15-20. But when something like Witcher or Divinity or a slew of other games give you 40-120 hrs of MAJESTIC content for $60, window-licking VR game that lasts 6 hrs for $40 (Stormland, Lone Echo, etc) is a bit much.",1575173153,f982gua,t3_e4905s,/r/oculus/comments/e4905s/as_a_busy_adult_i_love_that_there_are_good_vr/f982gua/,1,oculus,comment

There's no map, no markers, no way to know which plants drop what, which makes crafting annoying since you'll be backtracking a lot. Difficulty felt fine, though I immediately crafted two automatic pistols and used them akimbo. Combat is very primitive - backtrack and shoot, or charge and shoot, depending on enemy type.

111,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"There's fairly cheap ($15-25) Panasonic clip-ons, and the Koss KSC75. You can even 3D print adapters for the Koss, and attach them to the headset.

Having said this - depending on the  game you play this isn't advisable. I did roughly 2 hrs in one standing session in Asgard's Wrath last weekend, on highest difficulty, and the Koss ear clips wore my ears RAW. Like...painful, almost to the point of bleeding. Because in combat I move a lot, and the earclips slide around from violent motion. This doesn't happen when gaming on flatscreen, because my head barely moves at all, but in active VR it fucked up my ears.

So I wouldn't exactly recommend on-ear clips if you're doing something like BoxVR or Beatsaber. Unless you have big leathery ears or something. Mine are delicate, and I regretted that marathon session for half a week before they healed. And in Canadian weather (below freezing) it's not a good feeling.

130,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"Well, maps are linear, so it's not an open world, so you won't get lost or anything. You have your home/hub, and you venture forth. Later on, you unlock portals to teleport farther away, so you don't have to walk the whole way. The Sci-Fi feel is wonderful, and the whole alien flora and fauna was pretty great. But all the minutiae of base building and management, having to eat and drink now and again (and you get hungry and thirsty when you die, and get sent back to base). There is a quest marker showing loosely where you need to go, though they do disappear from time to time, but there's precious little info otherwise. 

Overall, I found it enjoyable. But I got to the point in the game where I have to craft new weapons and armor, and I blew a lot of resources building turrets like the game asked me to, and I don't have it in me to walk around exploding rocks and trees for an hour to craft it, and finish the game in another hour or two, just isn't worth the time investment.",1575175377,f98903a,t1_f985cnb,/r/oculus/comments/e4a0ux/seeking_dawn_in_sale_now_better/f98903a/,1,oculus,comment

The Allegory of Love is a series of four paintings by Paolo Veronese, produced around 1570 as ceiling paintings. Some experts have established that they were commissioned by Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor (1552–1612) for Prague Castle. They are now part of the collection of the National Gallery in London.

181,konstantin_lozev,t2_kix40,"The Black Friday sale is over, but I will give you my recommendations anyway. Keep in mind that streaming to a phone is a thing, so they can sit together and enjoy together watching their brothers. This is good, because for the 6 and 10 year old, their IPD is smaller and the Go may cause eye strain. In any event, all 3 should use it sparingly amd should take breaks to check how their eyes feel.

Probably the best games for them to enjoy together will be asymetrical coop games. Two of those are Covert and Keep talking and nobody explodes.

Angry Birds VR will be accessible and enjoyed by all 3, which is good.

Bat Batty Bats is also accessible to all 3, but is best played after Elevator to the moon, whichaybe only the 16 year old will understand.

Birtual Virtual Reality is also accessible, butaybe the youngest one might not het the humor and the point.

Blazerush is like toy cars so will be liked by the 3 of them. The controls are a bit hard, though, so the 6 year ild might struggle.

Dead amd Buried is simple enough and free, but it has (cartoonish) zombies, so maybe not for the youngest.

Eqqo is also accessible and a great story.

Fail Factory has a free demo and is simple and good for small kids.

Kev's compulsion and Mr Cat's adventure are small logical kid games.

Ocean Wonder is awesome for kids (you swim in the water and clean the ocean).

Pet Lab has free demo amd is great for kids (virtual pets &amp; kids, well, obviously a good match)

Slightly Heroes is a fun cartoonish shooter, maybe one of the few suitable for kids. However, it has artificial locomotion, so they will have to ease in.

Bathroom Shooting Games is free ans is also one of the few shooting games suotable to all kids.

Apollo 11 VR is educagional and boys love space usually. Other slave exploration games are Mission ISS and Astronaut VR, Spacewalk VR.

Other educational ones are: Jurassic World, Nuclear, Space Time, the Body VR.

Installing games to a HDD will give you much, much slower load times.

Thank you for contacting Oculus Support. I would be happy to assist you with answering your questions regarding purchasing games while in a bundle.

If you already own the game, it does discount the bundle by the percentage amount of the game you already have. If the bundle is further discounted due to a sale the discount will apply as the bundle as a whole.

**We have no information regarding if the discount is varied per a game or equally applied to all games and typically is up to the developer of the applications.**

Please let me know if we have answered all your questions.

Kindest regards,

Becca

283,JJ_Mark,t2_lvldo8p,"This was a big issue when Rift S first released, and still suffers some minor stutter here and there, but for the most part it's been corrected for months, now.  SteamVR tracking is definitely better, but then you'll have issues with a lot of SDE, which can affect how easy it is to spot targets in shooters.  Ideally, a Valve Index would be the best option, and if you know that you'll be able to make progressive upgrades over the next 2 years, you can start with a Vive and buy the Index HMD and controllers.  However, if you're like me and know that you'll be pushing it between game and PC part purchases, Rift S will likely be a better option.",1575184995,f98zht4,t3_e4bswh,/r/oculus/comments/e4bswh/i_know_that_mentioning_vive_on_here_is_probably_a/f98zht4/,1,oculus,comment

- while the extra FOV is nice you can archive nearly the same FOV on the Rift S by bringing the lenses as close as possible to your eyes

- the Index really has problems when anything bright is shown at all. It looks like you have fog over your vision. It's really distracting. The Rift S has close to none glare

- the praised Index controller feel really akward. While fingertracking is nice it's just a gimmick. And it even fails here and there.

Why introduce someone to VR with a game that is sub par VR mechanics? This idea there are no apps is so 2015. Ignoring all the games and progress we made the past 4 years is silly.

The one and only thing slowing down VR adoption is the price of quality VR, which is steadily declining. One thing i think more people need to understand is that VR is not for everyone. ""Mass adoption"" does not mean literally everyone will have it. IMO Mass adoption is when quality VR is under every kids christmas tree. 

Right now literally ALL the kids want it who have tried it, but it's just too expensive for the average parent. But not everyone is going to be into VR just like not everyone reads books to watches movies. Even someone who is into Video games is not guaranteed to like VR - it's not just a gaming peripheral it's an entire new medium of entertainment.

319,FSX76,t2_hi31p,"Pavlov peaked at 1.453 concurrent players in the last 24hrs, so it is by far the shooter with the biggest community which means you definitely made a good decision.

As others said, Onward is also great while being more hardcore than Pavlov.

But Zero Caliber will also soon receive a PvP mode and it still does good numbers, so it is far from dead as you can see at vrlfg.net. You have to consider that the site only shows the Steam player numbers not the people playing the Oculus store version (just like Onward).

In the middle to long term, I can imagine the new Medal of Honor or some highly polished VR BR game like Population One (sadly no news since months) to take over the multiplayer crown. That‘s without considering the possibility that Valve will release a proper CS VR (which Pavlov is known for) themselves. 

My other hope is that Ubisoft is developing a Rainbow Six VR shooter, but their two upcoming games will probably be Assassins Creed and Splinter Cell although Spies vs Mercs could also be great in VR.

Other than that, Solaris Offworld Combat from First Contact Entertainment should als be interesting, would love to have Firewall on PC VR though.

Room scale, is where this changes. The thing has so much front weight, and it has to be worn super tight to keep the optics from shifting when moving fast. The CV1 is just so light on the head. The tracking is also no contest if you have a proper sensor setup (I have 4), you'll have to deal with tracking loss in a number of games that use the space the cameras don't cover. 

Finally the biggest part, the refresh rate. The whole experience felt sloppy and the lower frame rate was definitely perceivable. Going back to the Rift was so much smoother.

372,RavengerOne,t2_r3znbbf,"I'd hold on to your CV1 for the time being, unless you replace it with a dedicated PC headset.

World scale is smaller on the Quest (you have to compare directly to see this for yourself), so the immersion is slightly less impressive.

Also the tracking, while good, is not as good as a 3 sensor setup for the Rift, or as the 5 camera array on the Rift S.

Comfort is a big issue. To be honest I could have almost bought a Deluxe Audio Strap for the money I've spent on counter weights battery packs and facial interfaces to make it comfortable.

It is an excellent headset in its own right for untethered experiences (large spaces + Quest = amazing), and games can look better on Oculus Link due to higher resolution and less SDE (though the picture is noticably soft).

459,JCatNY,t2_dvodj,"I had my CV1 connected to my desktop, and Rift S to my laptop (my laptop is more powerful). That was a good set up, and I kind of liked jumping back and forth between headsets. The Rift S has the sharper screen,  so once you see that, the CV1 appears blurrier, particularly the text which is quite clean on Rift S. I miss the deeper colors of the CV1 (especially the black level in a space game), but I prefer larger sweet spot, much less god rays and almost undetectable SDE of the Rift S. 

Was excited about the Quest, so I figured, I'd have one mobile and one connected headset. I found after a  few days, the Quest was being used much less, and for only short bursts of tetherless gaming. It was just too uncomfortable for me, and when using the link cable, it basically turned it into Rift-S.... with a few sacrifices.  So knowing what I've experienced now, I just should have kept the CV1 as a second headset, and not go for the Quest. Based on the types of games I play (No Man's Sky, Asgard's Wrath and Stormland for example) the Quest makes no sense for me, personally.",1575196850,f99ymwa,t1_f99thoa,/r/oculus/comments/e4djnp/does_the_quest_compliment_or_replace_the_rift_cv1/f99ymwa/,1,oculus,comment

The biggest issue is latency. Controllers do high-frequency tracking with internal IMUs that is corrected at a lower frequency by the cameras. Since you hands don't have IMUs, :) they are never going to be tracked as accurately or with the low latency that the controllers are tracked with.

It's mainly a power saving thing. So if you're connected to a projector and on battery it can just use the internal GPU for that lower performance task. If you're plugged in, or decide to use a GPU task on that screen it will still run it on the GPU, but it then needs to be copied over to the iGPU of the processor, which unfortunately causes too much latency for VR despite being okay for a standard monitor.

Here, I recommend this program, just scroll down and you'll see ""Update 10/18"" https://forums.oculusvr.com/community/discussion/47247/oculus-traytool-supersampling-profiles-hmd-disconnect-fixes-hopefully/p1

Download that, run it and in it you can mess with a lot of things, super sampling being one of them.

Supersampling basically renders a higher resolution image and shrinks it down to your screen, so take a 1080p monitor, super sampled to 4k, the image itself is 4k, so it'll look cleaner, sharper and less aliased, but it's obviously not as good as watching it on a 4k monitor, but there is a difference, trust me. 
I pushed my original rift to 1.5 and that's as high as I saw a difference, just jump in a game, look around, get out and set that to 1.5 and jump back in, you'll see what I mean (some people have a hard time seeing it for some reason). Be mindful it doesn't work in game, you HAVE to exit out every time you want to change it, but some games have a ingame one, but if you're doing it through here, I suggest leaving anything ingame to default 100%.

Another thing, if you want this to stay at whatever supersample you set it to (1.5 for example), make sure you launch it everytime you want to play VR, or check mark the box that starts it up on boot, up to you.

539,CaptainGreezy,t2_csbzd,"Supersampling means setting the GPU to render images at a higher resolution which is then down scaled to the native resolution of the headset.  The effect is similar/related to anti-aliasing which mainly reduces the jagged/pixelated appearance of sharp edges .  It doesn't increase the display resolution of the headset but it can improve the apparent quality.

Greeny is referring to the ""Pixels Per Display Pixel Override"" setting in the Oculus Debug Tool found at:

C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-diagnostics\OculusDebugTool.exe

The setting 1.4 would tell the GPU to render at 140% of the headset resolution.  If they were suggesting that for a 1070 I' sure your 2080 could do better.",1575082296,f94akyt,t1_f9463rw,/r/oculus/comments/e3nbpg/well_it_aint_a_rift_s_but_ill_sure_as_hell_take/f94akyt/,1,oculus,comment

The controllers are also more comfy then the CV1's, they have this sort of soft touch textured grip on the bottom side of the controller and it no longer slides in my hands during intense beat saber sessions.

734,ZephyAlurus,t2_9knuj,they're not saying the rift S is a 10/10. They're saying if the Rift S is a 10 in the scale so smth like the Index would be a 13/10 or smth. It's just using the Rift S as a perfect score so just they think that the CV1 is worse than Rift S by like 30%,1575091699,f94ksjk,t1_f948tcz,/r/oculus/comments/e3kwdr/rift_s_isnt_worth_the_upgrade_from_cv1_imo/f94ksjk/,1,oculus,comment

737,inosinateVR,t2_wsbv0,I own a Rift S but I'm honestly considering playing half life alyx on my OG Rift for those extra 10fps.  Valve has always pushed the importance of high refresh rates for immersion and half life alyx seems like it might be a game geared towards creating immersion through fluid interactions with your environment so the OG Rift might have a little bit of an edge there.

855,troutsushi,t2_2ghbvxyv,"It's not. FOV is the portion of the world in front of you that you can see. 
IPD is the distance between the centers of your eyes. 

Increasing FOV (up to the limit of the human physiology) makes you see more. 

Adapting to your individual IPD enables you to see a sharp image. 

In VR, more FOV is always better. Since IPD is rather individual (there are sweet spots, but generally you don't need to have the lenses set to your exact physical value), most people don't need the IPD adjustment (hence the Rift S's lack of it).",1575099733,f94rghb,t1_f94p9zl,/r/oculus/comments/e3nbpg/well_it_aint_a_rift_s_but_ill_sure_as_hell_take/f94rghb/,1,oculus,comment

Index seems promising with a wider field of view. Tbh- that was what I was hoping for the S which although they aren't calling it CV2 but like a between iteration- it sure seems like a CV2 to me. I wouldn't mind the same clarity as CV1 with S- if they gave us a bigger FOV. The biggest immersion breaker is feeling like you are wearing a diving bell with the limited FOV. Index at least has ""up to"" 130 degrees vs 90-100 degrees. The higher Hz is also intriguing.

But Quest is significantly heavier with lack or rigidity at the back of the strap means it doesn't catch my scull untill the pressure is a bit too high.

Comfort is the biggest drawback for me when it comes to Quest.

I still love it and use it more than other HMDs but it is a con of that HMD especially for longer play sessions.

And there are ways to make it better but while those mods help in a noticeable way they don't even approach comfort of Rift CV1.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also second calls to try out Asgard's Wrath. By far the meatiest and most 'complete' game on VR I've tried. Other notable mentions which you've no doubt already come across:

* Lone Echo: great example of VR with high-production values but it does get a little samey and the back half of the game is less interesting than the first half.
* Moss: this game is beautiful and a pretty low impact seated experience (and trust me, VR can get exhausting so its nice to have something chill).
* Dirt 2: This is the best driving game i've tried so far. Highly immersive and runs a treat on Oculus after an update.
* Superhot VR: a no brainer and very easy to pick up and play.
* Beat Saber: this is the best 'show your friends' game. Very much worth working out how to download and install custom tracks. But it does take some work to get setup.

1238,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"I think your argument is just fundamentally flawed. 

You may be right in that no more wired headsets would be coming, and S will be the last wired one. But who says you can't plug a WiFi adapter into an S? In the same way they just plugged a cable into a Quest to turn it into an S? 

If wireless were in near future, why would Oculus go through the trouble of wiring up Quest? Suggests wireless headsets, at least from Oculus, are still quite a ways off, a couple of years probably.

That S is discounted and Quest isn't could be easily explained by Quest costing more to make. They can afford to discount S, since it has no hardware built into it, but not Quest, which does.

Quest, without link or wireless streaming, is grossly inferior to S in terms of games it can run, and image quality. With streaming, it is still grossly inferior. With link, it is slightly inferior. Notice how many times I said inferior? And you think people who bought S are the ones who made a mistake?

Finally, comfort is a huge thing. Quest feels awful (to me), S is very comfy, I can wear it for 2+ hrs at a stretch without any discomfort at all. I can't last 30 mins in Quest. 

Given a choice, today, of getting a Rift S or Quest, knowing all I know, I would still go with Rift S. For wired PCVR, it is still the better choice in terms of refresh, pixel density, comfort, etc. This would be with the understanding that this headset will last me a couple of years, until next gen comes along, be it Oculus, Valve or whoever.

And nobody is going to shoot the messenger when messenger isn't shouting utter nonsense. To suggest that S will somehow ""die"" is as asinine as saying NVidia 1080 is going to die. You want me to embrace wireless future? Show me how I can play Asgard, wireless, today, with the kind of image quality and performance that Rift S provides, on a Quest.",1575004427,f91xdv8,t3_e39o7w,/r/oculus/comments/e39o7w/i_know_i_can_come_across_as_arrogant_but_ever/f91xdv8/,1,oculus,comment

1268,MrFarePlay,t2_4gafwx00,"It's how Quest owners played PCVR games before the Link. They used to stream the VR games through  wifi. There are apps that you have to sideload into your Quest using SideQuest to do this. There are a few out there but the ones I used were Virtual Desktop and ALVR. The quality of the stream were completely dependent on the games and the PC, but all these streaming apps required a 5ghz connection through the router because the 2ghz wouldn't handle it. 

Just to clarify. You don't need internet to stream. You just need your Quest and PC on the same router to communicate.

For those who didn't have a PC some were using the streaming service Shadow to rent a PC online, put steamvr on it, then stream the games from there to their Quest. Only the ones with good internet had good results with this.",1575006746,f91zp2e,t1_f90ra6e,/r/oculus/comments/e308ik/can_you_play_steam_vr_games_on_the_quest/f91zp2e/,1,oculus,comment

1277,Texas_Night_Owl,t2_1zhr41,"The Rift S has 3 subpixels per pixel (red, green, blue) whereas the Quest has 2 (red, green or blue, green).  So if you look at 2 horizontal pixels there will be 6 subpixels (R,G,B,R,G,B) on the Rift S and 4 subpixels (R,G,B,G) on the Quest.  Horizontally, the Quest would need 6/4 = 1.5 times the resolution of the Rift S to have an equal number of subpixels.  That would be 1.5\*2,560 = 3,840 pixels.  But the Quest only has 2,880 pixels.  This is offset somewhat by the fact that the Quest has separate displays for each eye, whereas the Rift S has more wasted pixels between eyes due to its single display.  Also, on the Quest the Red subpixels and the Blue subpixels are about twice as wide as the Green subpixels.    


However, the black space on each side of the Quest Green subpixels is about twice as large as the space between the subpixels on the Rift S.  So you have a double-wide black bar, a single wide Green bar, and a double-wide black bar. Think of the black bars as the wire on a screen door.  And you are looking at the world thru the screen door from close up.  You double the size of the wire, the more obvious the screen door effect (SDE).  That is why the Quest has worse SDE than the Rift S and the Oculus Go.  Also, the further away something is on the other side of the screen door the more noticeable the effect.  For example, if you are looking at someone that is close up there will not be hardly any noticeable difference (i.e. get in the character's face).  But if you are looking at someone in the distance (e.g. across the room) whose entire face is not many pixels, the difference in subpixels sticks out like a sore thumb.  It can also make reading text difficult.  For example, in Agard's Wrath when you are up on a ledge overlooking the ocean you can easily see where it says Hold Y to become a god if you are on a Rift S.  But on the Oculus, you probably won't make out the Y and if you are on a pretty high ledge you probably won't make out the word Hold.",1575007117,f9201mv,t3_e1cw7d,/r/oculus/comments/e1cw7d/is_there_any_benefit_to_the_rift_s_over_the_quest/f9201mv/,1,oculus,comment

It absolutely is. Even leaving the upfront costs, the ""upkeep"" of getting a few games a month, without sailing high seas, is significantly more expensive than one good game at 60$ bucks a month, at probably less playtime. Now don't get me wrong, I was fucking blown away when I put the headset on for the first time yesterday, and I don't regret spending the money on a decent GPU and the headset, but seeing the prices for games and some in-app purchases makes me laugh.

1348,BlueScreenJunky,t2_3ydik,"If you're wearing glasses the ipd is on your prescription. Or if you have access to a CV1 go to the calibration screen, adjust the slider untill the vertical bars are sharp and it will give you the number. I think there's also an iphone app that can give you a decent approximation. Or I guess you could always go to an optician/optometrist and ask if they could measure yours, it takes about 30 seconds.

120Hz will indeed reduce larency (and somewhat offset the fact that LCD screens inherently have higher latency than OLED screens found in first gen headsets and the Quest). It will also make fast motion smoother and clearer, and increase the sense of ""presence"" because it looks a bit more like real life and less like a screen.

But as you said, the Rift S is already fine, it's not like it will be a night and day difference, and keep in mind that even with good hardware you won't be able to push every game at 120fps (Although if you start dropping frames in 120Hz you should fall to 60fps, which is probably more acceptable than dropping to 40fps, so there's that).

What you actually see when your IPD isn't exactly matched to the headset, is a little bit of blur/fringing. But the degree of that blur might be so slight that it doesn't really effect the apparent resolution of the displays, which are of course still fairly low in this current generation. So A Rift S may be absolutely fine for you.   


Quest may give you a more ""perfect"" experience, but the Rift S has a greater effective sharpness anyway so it might even out. It sucks there's no easy way for everyone to demo both. I know none of this is particularly helpful, just some stuff to think about.

Every time I see this happening in Beat Saber its just the person looking down at their hands. New players of Beat Saber are still trying to figure out the mechanics and focusing on how to ""hit"" the blocks instead of looking down the lane at whats coming at them, so they stare at the floor. It's pretty funny, but happens ALL the time when showing BS to people for the 1st time.

If this happens in every game, even when the headset is level &amp; looking at the horizon, then it might be an actual issue and some of the other suggestions might help.

You need to reach behind either shoulder, depending on which object you want. That's never failed me once on the Rift S. Actually, never had a loss of tracking among the 2 dozen or so games I've tried so far. As for the IPD issue,  I agree - a bummer... and where the CV1 has an advantage. In terms of screen quality, once I played with the Rift S, then went back to my CV1, I noticed two things:

1) The CV1 has that deeper black, being OLED - makes the colors pop a bit more.  
2) The Rift S screen was much sharper, little to no God Rays,  and a barely visible screen door effect. Sure, the blacks can sometimes look like the darkest gray, but that's a small sacrifice,  and becomes a non concern when you're playing. 

When I flipped back to my CV1,  it seemed blurry. You can immediately spot it in Oculus Home with the text looking so clean on Rift S in comparison.

\- [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F85RQD2](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F85RQD2) \- Club3D 3m long cable, importantly it's DP1.4 \*certified\*, so should have no problems with the bandwidth and hopefully little to no signal noise.

1650,k8207dz,t2_5nscp,"That's probably one major reason, yes. Beat Saber is almost certainly the most popular game across both Rift and Quest. It is featured in pretty much every ad for the Oculus platform. It has very high brand recognition for a VR game. 

They don't want to lose that to another publisher. It also means that future sales on PSVR, Steam etc will be earning profit for them. As others have mentioned, there is a lot of potential to build on the existing foundation.

In the long run, this could just be the first of several acquisitions. It's been rumored and hinted that Facebook is acquiring other studios. They want to beef up their developer portfolio to encourage people to buy into the Oculus ecosystem and fend off competition. As a small studio, it was probably fairly quick to acquire Beat Games.

This can translate into slightly better/more consistent performance using Oculus SDK with oculus headsets.

Shroud raged a ton and still doesn't even bother aiming for their heads, which makes people who are used to winning all the the more frustrated and increases the likelihood of them turning other people off even more.

Pair that with the fact that people have no clue about what VR really is and them thinking it's some kind of glorified 3D-TV tech and you know why the audience is so small.

You could even pair with certain paint brands to advertise their colors in your game. Also, brush companies! There's all kinds of solutions for that.

I also recommend letting people upload their work onto a private cloud service (like maybe if they sign into Dropbox?) so they can save large-scale work without it sacrificing space on their Quest.

It's a bit different with games but playing something for 1-2 hours and then refund it, unless of course is due to technical issues, it's a bit odd, let alone write a review about it having seen only a very small part of the game; things take time, a slow start can lead many times to a great ending.

1888,Exceed_SC2,t2_eovej,"Rift S for me, the Quest was fairly uncomfortable to me, being too front heavy. As someone that is most just playing the top end games on PC, I almost always going to be tethered. Rift S also has a slightly higher refresh rate, you don’t have the minor issues of link (rare instances of age compression, and sometimes seeing the edge of the render region if you move your head too fast), you also get better tracking, a reduced screen door effect due to the arrangement of the pixel, and no god rays from bright areas on dark backgrounds.

Overall the Rift S is the best product for me, I had a Quest and returned it due to the difference I described above. But the Quest is still a fantastic product and it is for you if you don’t a gaming PC (yet, there is link now so if you get one in the future you can move to that), or if you think the portability is super useful.

1909,rodmunch69,t2_lhwx8,"I've had the Rift since DK1 - and the answer is simple - the Quest. With the new Quest Link you can use it as a Rift S, and it works amazingly well if you have the PC for it (mainly have a newer Nvidia card with a USB C port). I own the Quest, I use it all the time, I own a Rift CV1 that I haven't used in nearly a year. Two of my friends have a Rift S, and outside of the easy setup, they have never sounded overly impressed, in particular because of the garbage screen with terrible black levels. 

That's my opinion, but it's based on using this stuff for years. I can not overstate how big of a difference it makes to not have a cord - it's game changing. But if you want to play PCVR, well you can do so with a USB C cable. I think the reason the Rift S is on-sale is because it's not selling well and with the Quest Link software I don't really know what the point of it is anymore. It has slightly better tracking - but if that's the big thing then get a CV1 which has much better tracking (and a 90hz screen and an OLED display with the tradeoff being a bit lower res screen + more difficult setup).",1574931115,f8xrx4s,t3_e2uwhm,/r/oculus/comments/e2uwhm/which_to_get_rift_s_or_quest/f8xrx4s/,1,oculus,comment

1929,Reddituser703,t2_11504r,"\~3.5 yrs from today. The refresh headsets released at about the 3 year mark.

&amp;#x200B;

I disagree though. Sure, the 2019 headsets aren't the overall upgrade we all hoped for (not Gen 2 w/ eye tracking, 2k panels), but there's still major progress that was made in just 3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Valve**:

* Biggest improvements: Knuckles controllers and the Index HMD offering multiple refresh rates
* Marginal improvements: Lighthouse 2.0 increases room-scale to 30x30 ft and increased accuracy. Valve continues to offer the best external tracking system.
* Compromises (w/ trade offs): none

&amp;#x200B;

**Oculus**:

* Biggest improvements: Oculus Insight Tracking. Oculus now has the leading inside out system, overtaking WMR's 2 camera system. They released a standalone headset (deemed near impossible a few years ago) and released a black-magic like update that allows it to tether to PC. Early 2020 (4 year mark) they will release optical hand tracking for Quest (and hopefully RiftS).
* Marginal improvements: none
* Compromises (w/ trade offs): switched from headphones to piped speakers. Rift S switched to a static IPD system but included an eye relief (I personally would rather have the eye relief since I wear glasses). Touch controllers are lighter, but also more prone to damage.",1574932659,f8xsy3h,t1_f8xro74,/r/oculus/comments/e2u7t6/rift_or_index/f8xsy3h/,1,oculus,comment

nr2 . quest is super simple to use, it plays like console,  you put it on press power button, if you set you guardian you are literally in same place in game you been , you can play one song in same time it took to just to start game beatsaber game in rift s  
nr3 way more games, quest do have sidequest, go store, quest store, web games and pc - oculus and steam

nr3 oled , do i need to tell more, beatsaber is literally black game + some colors, in lcd beatsaber look way worst

1967,4as,t2_8fuwy,"Every VR engineer will tell you developers should aim to have at least 90FPS in their apps.  
[Unreal Engine docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Platforms/VR/DevelopVR/ContentSetup/index.html) say this:  
""You must maintain framerate, and ideally, a little bit of a buffer to make sure you're always over the **HMD's native framerate**. Low framerates are another trigger for Simulation Sickness, so make sure to optimize your project as much as possible.""  
[Unity engine](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/vr-best-practice#5c7f8528edbc2a002053b450) goes even one step further and has this to say about reprojection:  
""Although asynchronous reprojection is enabled by default on all applications that support it, it is important for the developer to understand this feature when comes the time to debug and optimize. **Developers should never rely on this technique in place of optimization** as this technique does cause positional and animation judder.""  
Which mimics what [Oculus themselves](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-performance-guidelines/) says about reprojection:  
""**Don’t rely on Asynchronous SpaceWarp (ASW) to hit rendering frame rate**.""  
Even [hardware manufacturers like Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/introduction-to-vr-application-performance-tuning) say the same thing:  
""\[...\] if you achieve frame rates and Late Stage Reprojection (LSR) values that  reach or exceed 98 percent of the target platform and hardware spec's performance ceiling, your application performs well. Put another way,  with a maximum achievable refresh rate of 90Hz, you could attempt to achieve at least a frame rate of 88.2 fps and LSR average.""  
Even [other VR manufacturers say 90FPS is the bare minimum](https://help.irisvr.com/hc/en-us/articles/215884547-The-Importance-of-Frame-Rates).

1969,Deaflat,t2_3pe2p75k,"The Oculus cable is in no way overpriced. The USB 3 spec limits cable length to 3m. That is a bit short for room scale VR. Anything longer than that requires active cables. Either copper with a repeater or fiber optic with transceivers in each end. 

The Oculus cable exists because of that limitation. It is a 5m long fiber cable and fiber cables are expensive. You won't find a 5m fiber USB 3 cable cheaper than that, let alone one that also supports charging and has a right angle connector on the other end. If the perfect cable for this use case existed, then Oculus wouldn't have bothered making their own. But since it doesn't exist, they did. They have also released the specs for the cable so third parties can make and sell their own, but they will be expensive too when they eventually show up.",1574935155,f8xuj3j,t1_f8xu49w,/r/oculus/comments/e2d6vb/any_good_cables_for_oculus_quest_cables_for/f8xuj3j/,1,oculus,comment

2050,UsernameUsed,t2_8pb9w,There are many different reasons why it could make sense. One reason right off the top of my head is simulated real life paintings. Go to a virtual location and find a spot and paint a section of what you see. Maybe you want to test a studio setup with lighting and a model or maybe just a still life. I feel it could allow some people develop an eye for things instead of just copying what they see when painting things that other people have made. It being in VR could also offer a level of focus that some people need by blocking out distractions while at the same time not making you feel confined to somewhere. It is also interesting to be around other creatives if this VR app would be multiplayer. You need to think outside of the canvas. VR can put you places that otherwise some people cant go and give you things you otherwise probably wouldn't have as an option.,1574823353,f8ua1jc,t1_f8tsj5p,/r/oculus/comments/e24999/why_has_no_one_made_a_paint_in_vr_program_that/f8ua1jc/,1,oculus,comment

To prove my point, this time next year, the next gen consoles will overshadow anything oculus related for the next few years. No hate but its just the reality of things.

2147,TalkingRaccoon,t2_cfii3,"I got a Rift S a few months ago and these additions were a must imo:

1) Hand straps to make them like knuckles controllers. You don't have to be constantly gripping your controller which is nice for long play periods. I have wrist problems so any help is good. but just being able to ""let go"" of stuff is excellent for immersion.  I got the [Mamut](https://www.mamutvr.com/products/mamut-touch-grip) ones, and really like them. There's these [Kiwi](https://www.amazon.com/KIWI-design-Knuckle-Controller-Accessories/dp/B07XYYNXJ3) too which are cheaper. 

2) I primarily play beat saber so [vr cover](https://vrcover.com/product/rift-s-vr-cover/) is a must so the foam doesn't get super gross. Also I got a workout headband or else sweat will get all in your eyes

3) And since i value sound for Beatsaber, the built in speakers just don't cut it (missing bass) so I got [these clip on headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Bionik-BNK-9007-Mantis-Headphone-Playstation/dp/B0735X5M4X) originally made for PSVR. They will clip on just fine to the Rift S halo. They sound fine. Maybe $40 was a bit much. If you're a tinkerer look up the [Koss headphones mod](https://imgur.com/gallery/V7zKoN9).

Valve is bundling half life Alyx free with all Index hardware purchases. Facebook sees this and thinks of a response - what's the most successful VR game? Beat Saber. So they could either make it free for all Oculus users by paying some per user fee (likely close to 50% retail). 

Conservatively - 200k annual headsets sold * $20/user = 4M per year in recurring licensing fees. Or they can just 5X that number and buy the studio for something like $20M, save their licensing fees, get all revenue from sales on other platforms, acquire great talent, and build a more aggressive set of partnerships for more (official) music on Beat Saber.

Yes. Flying an airplane is not difficult. I flew an airplane by myself for the first time when I was 16, before I learned to drive.

The reason learning to fly in real life is a big deal is because the stakes are a lot higher. When a car breaks down, you pull over. When an airplane breaks down, you may well die. You have to spend many days studying and then practicing:

* Weather, and how it can kill you

2234,vrgamerdude,t2_ewk7h," A long time ago in a convention center far far away I sat in awe of the announcement trailer for the Vader Immortal series and last week the trilogy was finally complete! Ever since that day at OC5 I have wanted to experience being a part of the Star Wars universe and last night I finally got my chance. As a true fan of the movie series I've gotta say that ILMX labs has really created something amazing with these short VR experiences and when you put them all together they form a cool side story to the films.  

Overall there really isn't much gameplay in these experiences other than wielding a light-saber a few times and using some basic force powers which admittedly were pretty lackluster in comparison to similar mechanics being used in other VR titles these days but even with the clunky controls and small amount of interactivity the sheer scale and beautiful graphics and voice acting quickly sucked me in and made me feel as if I was the silent main character in my own Star Wars story.  

Since this series is heavier on the cinematic style than gameplay I decided to stitch all three episodes into one continuous video. This was mainly done for those fans who might not own a VR headset so that they can enjoy the story and visuals on their 2D screens. As such I have time stamped each of the episodes below so that those who do not want to watch the entire video can skip to the various episodes quickly.  

Episode I starts at: [0:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZwSlBupiOY&amp;t=53s)  

Episode II starts at: [39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZwSlBupiOY&amp;t=2381s)  

Episode III starts at: [1:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZwSlBupiOY&amp;t=4198s)  

So if you are a fan of Star Wars or just want to see some high quality cinematic VR then I highly suggest giving the Vader Immortal series a look!  \[\]-)",1574830686,f8uinog,t3_e2axrf,/r/oculus/comments/e2axrf/vader_immortal_the_complete_trilogy_in_the_oculus/f8uinog/,1,oculus,comment

2255,Tsukitsune,t2_10r5zr,"I can, but the game gets pretty hectic and I end up just quick firing or shoot off beat just to survive. It doesn't really penalize you except you get a little less score. But when you have to choose between a lower score just to live or failing, I'm going with my off beat shooting. Even when I shoot to the music, it doesn't feel much different.

The game feels like a wave shooter with music in the background. You can shoot to the beat, but you don't have to. It rewards what would typically be a ""miss"" in other Rythm games and gives you a ""good"" equivalent. Hitting on beat gives a ""great"" equivalent.

Compared to Audica.
You shoot off beat, you miss. Slightly off - good, on beat - great. Get enough of a combo going, everything lights up and it feels great.

Any other rhythm game, enough misses and you fail. You don't get rewarded for off beat hits.",1574831722,f8ujqe7,t1_f8uhv7q,/r/oculus/comments/e1zall/i_would_highly_recommend_pistol_whip/f8ujqe7/,1,oculus,comment

&gt;When the game is available for purchase, the entire story mode will be in the game. Additionally there will be some post campaign modes (Sandbox type of things) available at launch. There are a couple reasons why we've been considering doing Early Access, but that is mostly related to community feedback and our desire to keep adding fun things. If we just say its a full release it would make more sense to have everyone move onto another project immediately so we do not waste any of our already limited resources.

Outside of these secondhand sources I can find no articles on the first page of google results stating the game will be early access.

2286,Tsukitsune,t2_10r5zr,"I meant releasing as in releasing as early access. The same type of verbiage they use to garner hype, with no indication of EA in their posts. It's either that or ""Available"" on X date. I forget which one. 

Also yes, I don't hate on Sandbox titles, there's plenty of people who like them. I'm just not very interested in them personally. I can not have interest in something without hating it. It's just not my type of game.

I was under the impression from lack of info, whether the story would be fully available during Dec10 early access. They have said it's finished, but whether it'll be available on EA release?  I couldn't find confirmation on that, so with all that. I wasn't very interested. 

If you say they're giving us the full featured game on early access, why not just make it full release? I just find that odd.  It'll be great, just unusual as most companies don't release into EA with most of the game finished. I just been burned and let down too many times by EA titles. Or tricked by clickbait posts saying the game releases or is available on a certain date when they're referring to early access.. so I'm really skeptical around these aspects.

2331,CaeruleoBirb,t2_2l5ew7zy,"While I'm definitely worried for the future of Beat Saber, I think it will be okay. The part about Beat Games never making another game for non-Oculus users is my concern. Unless Beat Games countered that in the contract, I doubt it though. They'd probably have to take less money in that case. For BS I think it'll be more high-profile songs, which means more paid dlc and fewer free songs. I doubt they'll remove custom songs, but I am a bit worried about BeatSaver. I could imagine Facebook rallying artists together for a class action lawsuit or something.   


&gt; Edit: Oh here we go. Downvotes. Typical of this sub. 

I mean, how dare you actually care about non-Oculus consumers here? They didn't pay Facebook, so clearly they're worthless and not worthy of Facebook games.

Hell that you can sculpt in VR is also not interesting at all for those who aren't planning to do that. 

The example made by u/shortyjacobs where 3DTV is looking at a 3D forest at distance, while VR is standing in the forest, is already a good one. But VR is one step further, you are participating physically in the forest. 50% of the appeal of VR to me are the controllers. And sure there are some fun VR games without controllers (eg, Edge of Nowhere), but overall the physical presence you got is a big selling point. But can you really explain that? Nah.

2394,difficult_smile,t2_4ztndrd8,"Because Quest's hand tracking (not finger tracking, that's another thing) it's meant for Entertainment apps such as Youtube or Netflix, which Rift S does not have at all (like any other PCVR headset). I think they'll implement it sooner or later, but not as fast as for Quest.

Apps for Rift S are not specifically designed for Rift S, but instead, designed for all PCVR. If they'll release hand tracking tomorrow, that feature will take some time to appear on any app, if any app designer chooses to implement it. On the contrary, apps developed for Quest are specifically made for it, and you must be in contact with Oculus in order to make it.

There is the misconception, online, that Quest can be just as good as Rift S by using link. That's not true.

2400,MrFarePlay,t2_4gafwx00,"No clue as of yet, but most likely the finger tracking is an OS feature that they will add to their android base OS on the Quest. This would work because the Quest games run on top of the Quest OS to get the finger tracking data, and also why it would work with the Quest home natively.

But Rift S games run on a PC OS (windows, linux, etc...). They can't do anything about it.

Still, individual developers can still add their own finger tracking solutions to their games with Rift S. So who knows.",1574841260,f8ury6e,t3_e2cowg,/r/oculus/comments/e2cowg/why_doesnt_the_oculus_rift_s_have_finger_tracking/f8ury6e/,1,oculus,comment

Had a CV1, O+, and upgraded to the S...  Here's some of my text conversation with a friend today:

""On the Rift: Yes, I upgraded to the Rift S and gave my Dad the CV1.  Setup is SO much easier without the sensors, and it's about 2x as sharp as the original Rift...  The headband audio sucks, but I run my Audio Technica ATH M30s over it when racing in VR, I just select soundcard output for sound instead of Rift S sound on the volume icon...  When doing jump around VR, I use a decent pair of in ear headphones plugged into the Rift S itself...  

It's not the 'best', but it's a MASSIVE improvement over the CV1 visually, and I had a Samsung Odyssey+ too...  It beats that in usability, and consistent visuals.  Wider FOV than the Samsung too.

I think the only headset better than the Rift S right now is the Index, but that's $900 for the full kit, compared to $350 right now...

In short...  Despite the audio that you have to work around, I like it a lot, and will stay with the Rift S until something much better below $500 comes out...  FYI, I have a GTX 1080 Ti, and Ryzen 7 2700X...  I stay maxed at 80fps all the time in about anything with a few settings tweaks.""

2439,zacnoo,t2_fpfci,"&gt;why they can't make it also work for the much faster Displayport connection

Isn't that the exactly reason they can't?

A lower bandwidth connection is significantly easier to send over a wireless connection and the Quest Link is only at like 150Mbps which would be ideal for wireless transmission without much, if any, additional hardware.

The Rift S on the other hand would require a battery, and encoding hardware to turn that displayport signal in to something that can be transmitted wirelessly. They would be two entirely different products with very different requirements.

Not only that but the Quest also has a bit more leniancy for latency because it can locally run ATW and potentially ASW in the future to litigate frame time variances over wireless.",1574843520,f8utkvt,t1_f8tt95l,/r/oculus/comments/e26dx5/wait_a_freaking_minute_im_a_vr_nut_follow/f8utkvt/,1,oculus,comment

2500,PoisonDartDog,t2_bbpo5,Not even counting the comfort factor (which the Rift S  wins hands down) I don't consider the Quest Link to be a replacement for the Rift S. It just looks blurry in comparison and I feel like I can notice the lower framerate.

2518,userminjo,t2_woexi,"I have both Rift S and Quest.  

First thing first, Oculus announced Oculus Link which turns Quest in to PCVR capable.  You will need the Oculus Link which will run at $70 or so when released later this year(word is, limited run by end of November but we will have to see.)  I say capable because it's not Rift S.  It will be 72hz vs 80hz, compressed image(impressive according to preview but not Rift S level(also LED vs OLED) and more latency(not sure by how much). So Quest will never be Rift S but you have the option to go standalone.  Also, you can lie down to watch Netflix with Quest but not with Rift S.  (I have Oculus Go for that though).  I play Beat saber and Journey of Gods outside on Quest as sun is setting and night using 8 infared led flood light @ amazon for $25 to stay cool while playing.  I'm already making it hard for you, are't I.  Keep reading plz.   The Oculus link supports GTX 1060.

My IPD is 67mm and it's fine for me so you shouldn't have problem with Rift S.

The Rift S is very comfortable and Quest isn't.  The Quest is very front heavy and puts a fair amount of pressure on your face.  I had 50 minute session once and rest were 20-30 minutes due to discomfort.   I think it was Abrash or Carmack who said they would have gone with Halo on Quest if time allotted.  People have tried mods to make Quest more comfortable via HTC Deluxe Audio Strap(was $99 last month, now it's whopping $249) or adding forehead support which made it better(to me, not by that much).

Rift S LED does make a difference in terms of SDE and Resolution but Quest isn't too far off.  I think OLED helps the Quest SDE and Resolution because the vibrant colors slight hides the SDE(easier to digest sort of way for the eyes).  If Quest was 720p ish, Rift S would be 820p ish.  

That is all I can think of right now.  Good luck.",1574736254,f8rb8ii,t3_e1pkx2,/r/oculus/comments/e1pkx2/anyone_able_to_answer_a_few_questions_regarding/f8rb8ii/,1,oculus,comment

Your narrative goes like this - I paid thousands of dollars for VR cause I had to have it, but you don't need that for VR. I do, but you don't. VR isn't expensive if the rest of you buy the ones I personally would never buy. I only bought one cause I can't afford spares, but VR is cheap for you.

How does that even make sense? If we don't need all that for VR, why did you feel you needed it? Either VR is expensive, or you got ripped off. Take your pick.

&gt; Somehow you missed the entire point of that comment where I said those things. 

Did I now? Let's look at it.

&gt;I cant believe I have to spend hundreds of dollars to play VR games.  
&gt;  
&gt;Spends literally hundreds of dollars to play other games.

Your original comment was that people spend hundreds of dollars on other games and so spending hundreds on this game is reasonable. You are creating a false sense of equivalence, here because VR is not hundreds of dollars in the same way other games are, but much more expensive than other games are. You personally spent THOUSANDS on just a single seat. What other gaming system have you spent THOUSANDS per seat on? All the other PC VR guys on this thread have also spent THOUSANDS, not hundreds. No other games is the same kind of money per seat.

I picked this comment out of the many because it highlights exactly the problem with the VR market in general. We have all these enthusiasts paying thousands and thousands of dollars for a system that only plays one person at a time, and then they get on threads like this and wonder why it isn't taking off. They imagine problems and boogymen to blame, and imagine some magical savior like Half Life 2 is going to put money in the hands of the unwashed masses so they will buy VR. The price IS the problem, and it always was. People loved the Rift before there was an Index. People loved the Vive before there was a Vive Pro. These improvements, if you want to even call them that, have not expanded what was already a niche market but instead either sold to the same people or cannibalized sales from each other. The answer to the chicken and egg problem is that you will have tons of eggs as soon as you quit charging too much for the chickens. You don't need a superchicken to save you.

2668,chris45215,t2_fd0ta,"It works, but it doesn't work. I'll give a full explanation.

The Kinect for Xbox One is a surprisingly robust and effective body tracker, if mounted correctly in a large enough room with plenty of space. The correct way to mount it is at about neck or head level with the sensor pointed downwards somewhat - this ensures the the top of the sensor's field of view is a bit above your head, and the bottom of the field of view sees as much of the floor as it can. Too many people make the mistake of pointing the sensor at their head, which means halt the sensor's field of view is just full of the ceiling, and that's pretty useless. You need the wall behind you to always be at least a foot or two behind you. The sensor uses the depth image for body tracking.

For the games that use the Kinect and VR - I don't know of any off the top of my head but I don't keep much track of it - that will give you decent results when using a Rift. There is something better, which is the Azure Kinect sensor, but it only works **with these critical caveats**: 1: you MUST have a Nvidia graphics card, GTX 1060 or better - the body tracking is completely dependent on the hardware on the Nvidia card, and there's no way around it. 2: It's still in development, so it's a bit buggy and constantly changing. 3: it's still in development, so games may not even support it. 4: It's very different from the prior Kinects, so it takes a bit of work for game developers to add support, so be a bit wary of any promises that it will be supported in the future. The Kinect For XBox One is a safer, cheaper, easier option and it's the one I suggest - but I'm throwing up this extra info because you'll probably run into the confusing name ""Azure Kinect"" (or ""Kinect For Azure"" as they sometimes call it) sooner or later, and should avoid it.

For the 'best' body tracking you can get on a consumer system, you'll have the most success with a Vive-compatible system with some extra tracking pucks. However, it's a pain to set those up because you have to play a game of musical chairs when first pairing and un-pairing them. And you need to factor in the cost of straps for them. And each tracking puck has a discrete dongle which requires a USB connection, and there is some confusing information about exactly which kinds of USB ports they work best with (IIRC they work best with USB 2 ports rather than USB 3), and multi-port adapters are discouraged - so you need a desktop with a lot of USB ports overall. I suggest buying sticky labels or a label maker if you get the pucks, so you can number each puck with its paired wireless dongle. That's what I did. To use those pucks, you must have the Vive towers/Lighthouses, they won't work with Oculus ones, so you're looking at 2 towers of $100 each as well as $100 per puck. If you're getting a Vive or Vive-based system (Index/whatever), it's not too bad because you get the towers already, but if you are going the Oculus route that's pretty expensive - and honestly I'd go for the Kinect at that point (check Ebay, you can get ones that are pre-modified specifically for PC use, and it's cheaper). Just keep in mind that the Kinect can only do so much.

Also, the Kinect has software limitations that only 1 Kinect can ever be attached to the computer at one time - you can't double them up for better tracking.  I haven't tried it with the newer Azure Kinect, but I expect that is 1 PC per sensor too. (There are kinda-sorta ways around this, if you are a professional software developer and can spend weeks making custom drivers just to handle the issue.... but then it gets even more complicated.)",1574745560,f8rnbr7,t3_e1mksx,/r/oculus/comments/e1mksx/full_body_tracking_with_kinect_using_the_rift_s/f8rnbr7/,1,oculus,comment

2726,BlueScreenJunky,t2_3ydik,"So... I completely recognize myself in the third character, as I'm sure many old timers do, and I don't think it's 100% our fault. We got onboard with VR with the Rift CV1 (some of us earlier than that) and it was awesome. The subreddit by that time was mostly people being amazed at how good VR was (and some posts about how Palmer Lucky was a terrible human being). We all thought that about 4 years later we'd have something even better.

And I think if some of us are a little better today it's because we invested a lot in the Oculus ecosystem in those four years (about $1200 worth of hardware if you count the $700 headset, $200 touch controllers, extra sensors, PCI-e USB Controller, and hundreds of dollars of games on the Oculus store). So now it's disappointing to see that for the foreseeable feature the only upgrade path is mostly a sidestep (sure Rift-S is more convenient but we've already setup our sensors just fine, the resolution is a bit better but refresh rate and blacks are a little bit worse, and the new touch controllers are not as sturdy) and I personally can't use it because my IPD is too large. This means that the fact that there's no replacement cable is really a bummer for us, and the fact that we can't officially use another headset with all the games we bought on the store over the years.

So yeah, I'm a little grumpy about oculus right now because i'm a bit disappointed in what they have to offer for VR enthusiast who have supported them for years.

At the same time I realize that for newcomers the Rift S and Quest are really good and affordable solution, so I can't blame them.

2926,Radulno,t2_e4h5f,"Image compression already pretty unnoticeable from reports is probably not something that will remain. I mean what's the difference between the cable Oculus develop for Link and the one from Rift S ? Is there any reason for needing to compress the image sent from the computer ?

Frame rate and tracking are meant to stay, though Oculus did say that 90 Hz is technically possible on the Quest though but they needed approval from some regulators (I don't really know why). Hope they get it.

And as far as Oculus efforts in dev seems to be focused, Quest seems to be their flaghsip product now. Oculus Link, hand tracking is only announced on the Quest and general marketing is fully turned towards the Quest (which is apparently very popular). 

I would not be surprised if their next headset is simply the mix of the Quest and Rift S in one device not having that weird choice (I mean only weird because of Link now being there). 

After years of watching the VR field from afar, I'm seriously thinking going in for Black Friday with the Oculus Quest and it's only because of Link really.

The compression is subtle and likely to get better over time once it’s out of beta, but rift s still has marginally better clarity. 

It’s unlikely that quest will get 90Hz support, unless it’s through a mod, due to oculus having to go through a certification process again.

3002,p3rfect3nemy,t2_xgzkb,Rift S is definitely clearer. Keep in mind they are not even rendering at full rez of the quest over the link. It has a render target near the original rift I believe. Rift S is also more comfortable for long play and until the actual oculus link cable comes out the current options for the cable are kind of awkward. Even with a 90 degree adapter the cable still hangs off very precariously and I worry about about hitting it during play potentially breaking the port.,1574648802,f8no7kv,t1_f8njtl7,/r/oculus/comments/e17ft0/now_that_oculus_link_has_been_released_is_there/f8no7kv/,3,oculus,comment

Some kind of cable management system for the rift s is essential IMO as the cable is trash. Not even exaggerating one of the worst cables I've seen on a device this expensive, I was getting spaghetti cable within 5 mins of unboxing the device and even if you do get it stretched out nicely it's really immersion breaking having to untangle yourself every few mins after spinning round a few times. I went for the kiwi pulley system and play sessions are so much better with the cable up in the air out of the way.

3D printed lens protectors if you wear glasses or have friends who will be using the headset to remove risk of glasses scratching the none replaceable rift s lenses.

I'd also recommend replacing the none washable foam on the visor with a third party one especially if you're gonna be passing it between friends.

3062,Greeny360,t2_rnp3t,"So I decided to try and make a better test on this since I'm eagerly waiting for the Rift S facial interface cover VR Cover are making and have said nothing about it yet, ever since the Rift S came out, I've seen very little people talk about this and 1 article mentioning it.

So I decided to try it and noticed how massive the FOV we have hidden away thanks to the original facial interface.

With the FI on, you can see how much I could see on the edges which is represented by the white circle, I took points of reference on all 4 edges to try and create a circle to better illustrate what I'm seeing.

Then I took it off and did the same test again. With it off, as you can see, the increase in FOV is drastic(green circle), to the point where I question what the hell Oculus was thinking, other than being extremely conservative for people who wear glasses. 

In any case,  seeing how as far as I can remember, VR Cover advertised how their cover for the OG rift increase the FOV ever so slightly, I hope that with this one they can manage to trim that interface and give us the nice comfort, as well as a massive FOV increase, maybe not this much, but at least in between the white and green circle in my screenshot.

I would love for this to gain more traction for those of us who don't wear glasses and want the biggest FOV possible, as well as I hope and in my head am sure that VR cover are aware of this, hopefully the facial interface delivers and isn't a let down, or that some other company does it.

What do you guys think about the findings? Upvote for relevancy?

3093,withoutapaddle,t2_4hf4w,"*As someone who played tethered VR for a couple years and then got a Quest, here's are my thoughts:*

I will say that **there are SOME games that are significantly more enjoyable with no wire**.  Stuff that involves fast movement and/or a lot of body movement are much more fun (IMO) on the Quest.  Superhot, Drunken Bar Fight, etc.  You can just spin around, run up to an enemy, suddenly duck or lung in a direction without any worries (as long as you've got a big area, which is easy to find with a standalone headset).

Tea for God on a Quest in a giant open area is one of the highlights of my VR career.  I've never felt more ""lost"" in a virtual space, exploring an impossible maze of hallways that felt huge compared to the 20x20ft garage I was in.

Another advantage was being able to **take my Quest with me when I was travelling for 2 weeks**.  I played Beat Saber on the regular when I was bored in the evenings in a hotel room.

That said, **the vast majority of games either aren't enhanced much by losing the wire, or suffer too much of a visual downgrade to be worth ditching the wire**, and I wouldn't buy a Quest if you're totally okay with doing all your VR next to your PC.  Rift S is going to be more comfortable, better looking, and ultimately a better experience for dedicated PC VR, period.

Quest is a jack of all trades (and only a master of mobile VR because nobody else is doing it yet).  It's a better value as a hybrid headset, but if freedom from wires has little/no value to you, then it's just a decent PC VR headset, comparable to last-(sub)gen headsets like Rift CV1.

If I wasn't expecting a kid soon and starting to think about cutting back on unnecessary spending, I'd probably go for a Quest and Index to, as Rift seems to have less of a future than either of those, but it's still the best PC VR experience you can get for less than 4 figures.",1574655489,f8nxd31,t3_e16r36,/r/oculus/comments/e16r36/quest_vs_rift_s/f8nxd31/,1,oculus,comment

3095,drakfyre,t2_46apm,"PSVR feels much better, optically, than the Rift S for me.  It doesn't cause me eye strain.  But it also feels much cheaper in the headset area and MUCH lower resolution, compared to either the Quest or the Rift S, and it also somehow feels more ""distant"" from the world?  Also, the PSVR tracking is quite frankly not great.  Do keep in mind I own the gen 1 headset though so I don't know how the newer rev stacks up.

It's pretty amazing PSVR is as good as it is given the hardware for it honestly; there's only one point and dead-reckoning based on a skeleton to track the Move controllers and there's like 10-20 LEDs *per controller* on Quest/Rift S (The controllers are the same on both).

3097,Greeny360,t2_rnp3t,"The FOV on the Rift S is fine, it's basically the same as the OG Rift, at least for me, the reason for this is how much FOV we have hidden away because of the large facial interface. As for the screendoor effect, the Rift S has basically no Screendoor effect, unless you really, but I mean really want to look for it. On my OG Rift I would get distracted by it as I play, with my Rift S  I just play with no issues.

Tackling the change when I take the facial interface off, the biggest difference aside from the FOV is the fact you basically have edge to edge clarity, like almost perfect, if not perfect edge to edge, I'd have t test again. When the interface is on and you turn your eyes to the edges, it only gets blurry right at the edges, since the sweet spot on the Rift S is massive, but being closer basically eliminates that.

Lastly, the VR Cover comment, I assume you made a typo and meant to say ""VR Cover are NOT doing a full replacement for the Rift S \[...\]""? Because I've tweeted at them several times throughout the months about it and they are working a facial interface replacement, what they released a while ago was just the soft cover, meant for the original facial interface.

3104,jasonvrlife,t2_4hxst90c,"The Rift S is going to be obsolete I think.  The Quest with the link is really great.  I just tried out all my titles and about 90% of them played great.  Only 1 steam early development title was playing laggy.  But all the oculus exclusive stuff was playing great and much better than when I use Quest over the 5ghz wifi.  Excited to get a longer cable and use my Quest a lot more often now.  It also gets far less hot and annoying on the head when using the power from the link rather than the internal hardware.  Another plus.  Quest + Link is really nice choice with the ability to unplug and take it anywhere and still be able to access core apps like Bigscreens, Robo Recall, Pavlov, Media/Tv/Movies etc.  Being able to go into Bigscreens movie theater while laying down in my bed in another room is huge advantage.  Going to be able to take my Quest home for thanksgiving and use it without my PC which is great.  Also the Rift S has one of the worst mics I've ever heard.  I can't believe how bad the Rift S mic is.  And the resolution of the screen is lower than the Quest and is not OLED.  I need OLED for the movies I enjoy.  Nothing like a completely dark theater and those OLED vibrant colors.  Very happy with the direction they are moving with the Quest.  I would consider a Rift S only if the price came way down on it because its just not as versatile as the Quest and always needs power from a super pc with displayport.

Well you're definitely right about that. Agreed. 

They're just so similarly priced that I feel an S might be better value, but I might be biased because I primarily use it for heavy gaming and it's getting a lot of use for that purpose

3144,Sanya-nya,t2_85aiw,"&gt; First of all here is the Guinness Record entry:https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-development-period-for-a-simulation-game

I know of it, but it can't be verified. I'll gladly remind you that Guiness has hundreds of similar unverifiable records - they make for a good point in CVs and you can simply pay for them and somebody will ""just"" check it's not a complete crap, but they usually won't go into technical details for similar claims.

By the way, in a similar way you could claim that Star Citizen's start of development was in early 90s, because that's when Chris Roberts says his ideas originate from.

&gt; The project failed the same year when Braben and Co realized they didn't have the engine and server tech to pull off a massively multiplayer version of Elite they way the wanted it.

So that's already stopped development and you can't really ""connect"" it to the later development, I guess? Or how exactly does this work (my guess: Nobody can define it properly, so the category itself is a nonsense).

One of the quotes from said articles:

&gt; He admitted that the game itself, which he has repeatedly made refernece to in interviews for the past few years, has had a stop-start production as Frontier keeps testing technology and then rejecting it.

This basically means that the start of the development is unknown, because rejecting a tech means you stopped a production.

All in all, I agree that some EIV's parts might have helped in Elite's development, but I would strongly disagree that E:D's development started in 1998.

A final proof that Guinness records are a bunch of nonsense. Why is Elite not listed here? https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-protracted-game-development/#:~:targetText=Officially%20announced%20on%2028%20April,game%20engine%20and%20other%20issues%22. , when according to your record it took longer than DNF? :)",1574659422,f8o1n47,t1_f8nn4hz,/r/oculus/comments/e0sh75/watching_the_latest_star_citizen_video_reminded/f8o1n47/,1,oculus,comment

3212,yura910721,t2_eagh4ux,"I was in the same position: I love VR, but I couldn't convince myself to get a gaming pc+pc vr headset. So when I heard about Oculus working on Quest(Santa Cruz back then), I got curious of it as a proof of concept(wireless vr with a mobile chip rendering pretty demanding vr content at a high framerate sounded like a quite a challenge), because I was convinced if they manage to pull it off it probably gonna cost 500+ bucks. When they announced it is gonna be 399, I couldn't resist it anymore and jumped on the bandwagon. 

So if you don't have a PC, it is pretty much a no brainer: amount and quality of content is more than convincing to get it. I personally enjoy playing Thrill of Fight, Beat Saber, Tilt Brush and Racket Fury. I do envy people playing Stormland or Asgard's Wrath and now upcoming Half Life game, but Quest is amazing and I have no regrets getting it.

Regarding purchases of games, I would suggest not to go crazy and start with free demos first and see if those games actually up to your taste(that's how I got hooked on Beat Saber). I personally chose games that offer decent replay-ability as story based games on VR at the moment are way too short to justify the cost.",1574664676,f8o6byk,t3_e1an1z,/r/oculus/comments/e1an1z/buying_dream/f8o6byk/,1,oculus,comment
3213,tmvr,t2_11qlhv,"&gt; No, I remember it because they marketed the hell out of the new h.264 encoder.  

Yes, because Twitch and others do not support h265 :) That's why the marketing was concentrated on h264. It doesn't mean the improvements are only on the h264 side. And they weren't. Anyway look for example here:

&gt; Turing GPUs also ship with an enhanced NVENC encoder unit that adds support for H.265 (HEVC) 8K encode at 30 fps. The new NVENC encoder provides up to 25% bitrate savings for HEVC and up to 15% bitrate savings for H.264. Turing’s new NVDEC decoder has been updated to support decoding of HEVC 4:4:4  8/10/12-bit video streams, and it also supports VP9 10/12-bit HDR similar to Pascal GP102/107/108 and Volta GV100 GPUs. 

From here (page 22):

[https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/design-visualization/technologies/turing-architecture/NVIDIA-Turing-Architecture-Whitepaper.pdf](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/design-visualization/technologies/turing-architecture/NVIDIA-Turing-Architecture-Whitepaper.pdf)

Or here:

[https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-video-codec-sdk](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-video-codec-sdk)

It's both h264 and h265 everywhere. The Twitch blurb is there as well because of the whole ""you can stream now in 4K with our GPUs"" marketing, but that will obviously only mention h264 as Twitch does not support h265.",1574664725,f8o6dco,t1_f8n9y8j,/r/oculus/comments/e0od0i/john_carmack_on_twitter_i_am_hoping_to_add_a_new/f8o6dco/,1,oculus,comment

3249,CMDR_DrDeath,t2_mob98,"&gt;Between 2005-2008 Frontier built the engine and tech that would ultimately power Elite Dangerous. That is when I heard Braben give a talk about it at a Develop Conference (Jul 30th 2008). Which was just after ""develop magazine"" featured a article on Braben in Issue 85 (July 18th 2008 https://issuu.com/develop/docs/dev85\_web). After the conference the Elite forums and developer media where all excited to hear that Elite IV's tech was almost done. Like here:

Why did you ignore this. This is Braben clearly saying the nearly finished the tech for Elite in 2008 at a conference. Full six years before the game released.  I know this to be true, because I was there. Spoke with him. That is why I am even aware of this conference in the first place.  Look at the Elite Dangerous wiki page. How was there info on it from 2005-2012 if the game supposedly only started development in 2012. This revisionist history crap you are doing is bullshit.

3294,MM2Coop,t2_4hvzcrsq,"Well there are also comfort options for people in Vr games, like teleportation. Half life will have this as an option as well, even if I will play the game with full free movement, other have options. 


A game developed from ground up with Vr in mind is not really possible to be played on a monitor with mouse and keyboard. Watch the trailer again and think about how you want perform all those actions with kb/m. Like searching in a board for bullets. 

In Vr you can move your Head and both your hands completly individually. It controls just like in real life.

So while it may be possible to script all VR events to buttons and animate them, it would take away a lot from the game. It is to expected that half life Alyx without Vr would just be mediocre at best. Why do people want to sell them a mediocre game at full price? It would hurt the brand half life.

Also, coming from video production, Im allergic to visual artifacts and most of the time I dont notice them with link, however in high contrast scenes (title screen of Edge of Tomorrow for example) I see banding from compression. Also it seems that its taking more power from my PC to run link than native Rift S even though fps is lower and effective rener resolution is supposedly the same. Stormland for example works fine on Rift S but there is heavy latency with Link. And the more power game needs, more latency I notice. Beat Saber is flawless but dont really see the point in doing that since Quest version is awesome. But its definitely the absolute best way to play Edge of Tomorrow.

Conculsion for me - if you only get one HMD, get a Quest just because of the value. But if you can have both, Rift S is far superior for PCVR, at least for now.

Image quality in itself is not better than the 2160p clips if you disregard the whole ""brighter seems better"" trap, the biggest issue seems that when playing the h264 60FPS labeled clips the playback is choppy. Now I wasn't going to hunt down the original clips from the publishers and do some extensive detective work to see if the clips are actually 60FPS, but it's a bit of a hit and miss with DeoVR (well, SLR really) due to them transcoding the 30FPS clips to 60FPS versions as well.

Then add the fact that PCVR over Quest Link compressess and subsamples the output res from the PC and you end up with a softer image on the Quest than the Rift S even if the Quest used RGB Stripe LCD like the Rift S which it doesnt.

If PCVR is your primary VR thing, then you didnt make a mistake at all. Quest Link is a fantastc value add for people who were buying the Quest for mobile VR anyway but unless you wanted one for mobile VR as a primary use-case, its not worth the compromises for those primarily buying a HMD for PCVR.

3373,r4ind4nce,t2_nrm3g,"While Oculus games work fine with Link for me, starting Steam VR games was very hit and miss, but this might get fixed as time moves on and Link moves out of Beta. With the Rift S SteamVR stuff worked flawlessly and looked great, but with Link there's a certain amount of lag and some games get severe performance issues. I've also run into in issue where the games keep thinking that the grab buttons or triggers a constantly held down, making it unable to open a fist, let go or grab something in some games, it's quite odd. In Compound my fists wouldn't open, in Blade &amp; Sorcery letting go of stuff was veeery finicky. In H3VR physics seemed to happen in slow motion (and not in a good way).  


The Quest is a steal for 200 nonetheless, there are lots of great experiences on it. PCVR can be impressive through Link, but the warping and slight compression blur is something I notice a lot - Rift S is smoother, more responsive with better tracking and looks better, too, also it works with pretty much anything without issues, since it's native PCVR. If the option of taking the Quest on the go is enticing to you I'd use that, but if you're here for that PCVR goodness, everything is better on Rift S... but you're always tethered and there's no hardware IPD-adjustment.",1574676364,f8oed9x,t3_e1bcks,/r/oculus/comments/e1bcks/how_does_the_oculus_quest_with_oculus_link/f8oed9x/,1,oculus,comment

3436,Sanya-nya,t2_85aiw,"&gt; All in all, I agree that some EIV's parts might have helped in Elite's development, but I would strongly disagree that E:D's development started in 1998.

Why did you ignore this? ;)

Look, I don't deny there was **some** reuse of work. But that's what I say towards the end as well - is Doom the longest game in development, because John Romero released Sigil in 2019? Is Elite the longest game in development ever, because it still uses some concepts from the original Elite (like procedural generation)? Is DNF not the longest game in development, because at some point it was sold to other company, thus breaking the development and basically restarting with some assets? If Elite IV was supposed to be single player, did E:D's development start only when the goal changed to pure always-online or not (as you could argue those two concepts lead to completely different games)? And so on, and so on.

Nobody specifies these categories and it's unclear what ""in development"" actually means, unlike stuff like ""highest jump"" or ""the most balloons popped in one minute"" (though to be honest, some of these categories have similar pitfalls and need lots of further specifications). If I write one line of Tic-Tac-Toes today and then finish the code in 50 years, will I qualify for a Guinness record?

3443,grumbel,t2_4iv60,"I somewhat disagree. If Facebook pulled out of VR right now, than sure, VR would be in a bad place, since they own Oculus. However a whole lot of VRs problems only started once Facebook jumped in. Back when Oculus was on it's own, they had no problem delivering a $300 headset. But once a lot of money entered the game, expectations exploded and so did the headset prices, which in turn killed all the VR hype that was build around a $300 headset. And that in turn made a lot of developers jump ship. On top of that Facebook fractured the market with exclusives and Facebook being Facebook really didn't help the image of VR either.

Without Facebook, VR would have had the chance of a much more natural growth, driving by supply and demand. All those indie games that don't sell, would have a easier time selling copies if they wouldn't need to compete with Facebook funded games.

The problem with Facebook being around is simply is that now every small fish has to compete with Facebook, and most simply can't, so they don't even bother.

The 8750h is a 6 cores CPU which is relatively new for laptops and runs pretty hot so it's hard to use it's full potential without thermal or power throttling. Getting a cooling pad and undervolting the cpu are the main ways to avoid thermal throttling, and it's the only way I could get a smooth experience in VR. As for Blade &amp; Sorcery, I also have the same issue where FPS drops to 40 (even with everything set to low). Only thing I found was to disable ASW with Oculus Tray Tool, that way the framerate dips only to 65-70fps, which is already way more playable.

3467,PrAyTeLLa,t2_pqsjg,"Reminds me of what Joel Breton said at GDC in 2017. Two different sources from interviews.

https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-03-22-oculus-not-doing-developers-a-service-says-htc-vive

&gt;""We took a very platform agnostic approach, both to our internal content but also to our partners' content. And that is, let's let content be free, and go wherever there's a market for it. As opposed to, let's lock down the content behind this wall and block out 70-80% of the marketplace. We just didn't feel that made sense for this early market space that we're in. And it doesn't make sense for developers because it doesn't give them a path to long-term success. So developers definitely appreciated that.""

&gt;When asked directly about the big sums that Oculus has used to fuel VR development, Breton continues, ""I actually don't think [their investment approach] is great for the market because... what they are actually doing is getting developers to trade long-term success for short-term cash. And so they are teaching the developers that essentially we can give you this grant for X millions of dollars but your content is not likely going to match the market that it's going to come into. And especially if it's locked down to a platform that has a very small percentage of the overall market.

&gt;""So this is not doing the developers a service in my view; in a sense it's trading some short term cash to maybe get them through this year but the folks that are working from the ground up and trying to match the development size and scope with where the market's at today, they are actually setting themselves up to be long-term businesses. That's who we want to work with.""

https://www.vrandfun.com/htc-vive-joel-breton-disapproves-oculus-business-strategies/

&gt;Breton also provided his two cents about Oculus and its business strategies. “Oculus, I think they’re doing good work for the overall ecosystem in some areas. I disagree with their strategy a lot.” What the Vice President of Global VR Content at HTC Vive is referring to here is Oculus’s exclusive content business strategy. “I just feel that they’re essentially hampering developers’ ability to create large communities by blocking them out from other platforms.”

&gt;Oculus believes that without their funding, some of these exclusive games would’ve never seen the light of day and never even exist in the first place. Breton finds this problematic for the “developer’s long-term success.” This is due to the fact studios are receiving large fundings for big exclusive games but when they try to develop a game of their own, they won’t be able to “develop at the size and scope that the market is at.” Breton believes this business strategy might be setting studios up for failure down the road.",1574681805,f8ohvrj,t1_f8ogdpy,/r/oculus/comments/e1e8eb/chet_faliszek_vr_would_be_a_really_dark_space/f8ohvrj/,1,oculus,comment

3484,CMDR_DrDeath,t2_mob98,"Since when is concepting and pre-production no longer part of the development process. When Braben announced the game they certainly did pre-production. There is no way they announced the game at E3 in 1998 and then did nothing for three years.  
Well, fact is we know the game was in active engine development as an MMO, not as a single player game from 2000-2001. Braben has said as much in a Gamespot interview back then. That was always the point of Elite IV. They couldn't make it work, so they stopped and put it on ice. But it is active development time for the same game.  

Could you imagine if CIG did this with Star Citizen ? Stop development for a year and say hey this isn't working. We are taking a break and starting over.  People would count that as development time as well.  I am not saying that Elite is the longest game that has ever been in development but it is certainly in the top 5. And as far as simulation games goes there is nothing that took this long to make.  Regardless of whether you want to count the entire period or not. Who checks this ? Well Braben gave interviews and talks about it during this period. So we know it from the horse's mouth that they were doing this work. So, whether or not you want to believe in the Guinness entry for which Braben has a certificate in his office or not, at the very least, the same game was in development, specifically engine, tools and network architecture development by more or less the same team from 2000-2001 / 2005-2010 and from 2011-2014. Granted they did have some significant personal turn over in 2010. However, at the very minimum that is 9 years of documented development, with an uncertainty period after E3 and 4 years were most of their attention was on ""The Outsider"". 
If your point of contention is the actual Guinness book entry, then fine, ignore the entry. But the fact remains Elite IV is the simulation game with the longest development. They didn't just make a few assets and it wasn't just SOME development in those mid 2000s they build the whole Cobra engine. The engine, the tools, the network architecture those are the bulk of the development of a game like this. Especially, considering how much of this game is procedural.  That technology is still the basis Elite is being built upon today.  

See personally, I don't mind to wait for a good game like that for this long. Elite is quite the achievement and as such I hate to dismiss all the work that the team put into it over the years. When people say the game was made in between 2012 and 2014 then it just diminishes the effort put into it.",1574682308,f8oi90r,t1_f8ogk7g,/r/oculus/comments/e0sh75/watching_the_latest_star_citizen_video_reminded/f8oi90r/,1,oculus,comment

He's right that we are still at a very early stage of hardware development and whatever you buy now will probably will have a much better version in 1-2 years. That doesn't mean that the older hardware is useless after the release of the new version.

3571,NeonJ82,t2_56g74,"While I'm not wheelchair-bound, I play VR in a chair. (Mostly because I don't have enough room to move around, but it also helps lock me in place and makes it *physically impossible* for me to overstep my boundaries, so I can flail around without worry.)

And honestly? *Most* VR games work very well even with this. The only game I've had issue with so far is QuiVr, which had things I needed to interact with be physically outside of my boundary, so I couldn't actually use the menus. Most games allow you to grab objects and interact with things from a distance so that you don't have to physically move yourself.

However, one issue I do see is grabbing objects. Good games typically allow you to grab objects from a distance, zipping them to your hand. (I've seen no game do this as well as Rec Room, but I've noticed it's also present in the Boneworks and HL:Alyx trailers) Unfortunately, some games require your hand to physically overlap an object in order to grab them, which would probably make grabbing items on the floor impossible. (The only two games I can think of which this would be an issue is Job Simulator and A Township Tale. I'd imagine Vacation Simulator too, but I haven't played it yet.)

So, for ""games that are simple and enjoyable for people in a chair""... that basically just boils down to ""games that are simple and enjoyable"". Unfortunately, the only ""simple"" games I can think of are The Lab, Beat Saber, Waltz of the Wizard and Rec Room. However, I know The Lab is Steam-exclusive and Rec Room has limited features on Quest. Waltz of the Wizard is said to be *coming* to Quest, but hasn't released yet. (And of course, you already know in regards to Beat Saber.)",1574567482,f8gzrs5,t3_e0r69d,/r/oculus/comments/e0r69d/wheelchair_friendly_titles/f8gzrs5/,1,oculus,comment

3576,saintkamus,t2_cm8st,"&gt; I need just a little more sharpness as the image is a little soft at the moment.


I'd say it's very soft. With AL-VR's higher resolution you can get a picture that looks a lot sharper than link (it chokes the encoder though, it's unplayable)

Just staring at the tree of the SteamVR home environment looks very soft in comparison to what AL-VR can do.

If we were able to harness the full sharpness of the Quest's displays, the image would look almost as sharp as the one on a Rift S (but the compression would still make sure it looked worse, no matter what)

I think any improvements we get are going to be *very* noticeable.  And it's encouraging to hear that the reason why it's so low-res isn't because of a Quest limitation, but a PC encoder consideration.",1574567760,f8h0fwi,t1_f8fujfk,/r/oculus/comments/e0od0i/john_carmack_on_twitter_i_am_hoping_to_add_a_new/f8h0fwi/,1,oculus,comment

3578,AThingWithAThing,t2_t4agl,"Quest has Beat Saber and Superhot. If you get a working USB-C to USB-A cable, you can play SteamVR games on the Quest at a lower refresh rate compared to the Rift S (72hz on the Quest vs 80hz on the Rift S), a reduced resolution (Supposedly comparable to a CV1. Even if it gets improved though, artifacting is going to happen and since it is an OLED display, it will not look as sharp as a LCD panel, which the Rift S has), and- subjectively- reduced comfort. However, you gain a VR HMD that can work as a standalone device or as a PCVR HMD.

If you like wireless and the ability to play anywhere, the Quest is going to be what you want. If you care about the PC more, get the Rift S. Just be sure that your PC is good enough for VR if you plan to do PCVR in any capacity and in the case of the Quest, the Link feature doesn't officially support every GPU out there.

Anyways, here's some game recommendations for PCVR (I haven't played the current major Oculus titles because I personally really don't have much interest in them):

* (FREE) The Lab if this is your first VR device, or showcasing it to other people.
* (FREE) Google Earth VR if you want to check out your home and other areas in VR.
* (FREE) Aircar if you want to showcase VR to other people.
* Blade &amp; Sorcery if you want a sword-fighting physics sandbox. Mod this game with mods off of Nexus like Outer Rim, KatanaPack, etc.
* Pavlov if you want something akin to CSGO in VR with workshop maps that have gamemodes like TTT, zombies, etc.
* Skyrim VR if you just want Skyrim in VR. Mod this game with the guides on r/skyrimvr too.
* Arizona Sunshine, loading times are not too good for me though.
* Climbey for a neat climbing game.
* The Forest if you want a survival horror game.
* Payday 2 VR if you like Payday 2. It's free DLC for Payday 2.
* Hotdogs, Horseshoes, and Hand Grenades, a fun gun-simulator sandbox. It has weapons and a map from TF2 as well.
* Space Engine if you want to explore space.
* Thief Simulator VR if you want a both polished and janky, well, thief simulator.
* Tabletop Simulator if you like playing card or board games with friends.
* Star Trek Bridge Crew if you want to work with a crew of people to operate a spaceship.
* Thumper if you want a rhythm game.
* Until You Fall, a fun rogue-like sword-fighting game.
* I Expect You to Die, a fun seated puzzle game.
* L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files if you like the original game...or just want a detective game. Word of warning, this is not the full game in VR, only some of the cases.
* Gorn if you want a more unrealistic sword-fighting game.
* Dolphin VR to play some old Wii, GameCube, and some N64 games in VR. Mileage may vary from game to game.
* Vivecraft if you have Minecraft Java Edition.
* (QUEST/PC) Next year, the beta for a Half-Life 1 VR mod will come out. While there is a mod right now, the dev is gonna be working on a better version. HOWEVER, Quest has HL1VR in the form of Lambda1VR.
* VorpX for playing older games, mileage WILL vary from game to game, lots of tinkering is involved. I would only get this if you have $40 that you wouldn't mind losing, if you are willing to tinker with settings, and if you really want to play older games like Fallout New Vegas in VR.

The Rayman Origins and Legends games for example, while consisting of non-polygon graphic for the most part, are so layered and with frequent scaling and movement into and out of the screen that they both work superbly in stereoscopic 3D.  I'm told the first Ori game is stunning in stereoscopic as well but the only way I'm aware of to play that one in 3D is via VorpX, which I don't have.


Trine 4 on the other hand, despite also having very pretty graphics, just hasn't captured my interest.  The first three had such great stereoscopy that all I can think about is how much better it would be in 3D.  But VR exceeds even that stuff for me in general.

3680,JCatNY,t2_dvodj,"Been going back and forth between headsets, but seeing the PC specs you have, I would opt for the Rift S. I love the Quest's portability, and the link makes it quite the amazing hybrid system,  but I find myself using it only for short, 20 minute bursts with its native games like Beat Saber, or  Vader Immortal.

Since I like playing the large scrope games like Asgard's Wrath, and my most recent purchase, No Man's Sky, I prefer the best fidelity, performance and comfortably. There is no way I'm using my Quest with link for those, if I have a Rift S sitting 2 feet away. If I didn't have the S, than it would be a whole different story.

Besides the huge comfort factor difference (for me), the Rift S screen is has got me hooked. I  had the original Rift (sold it). The Quest screen door effect is definitely an improvement over the Rift, but the Rift S has virtually no screen door effect, resulting in a crisper display. 

The Quest's screen is also pretty damn sweet, but that's without the link. With it, colors and detail are a bit softer/muted and there is moments of latency here and there, depending on the game. For a beta release though, I'm floored. 

Without link, the sense of freedom on the Quest is one of its best features, and for many people, that outweighs everything and I can understand that. I mean, you can't beat walking into a different room, setting up a guardian which takes all of like 15 seconds, and off you go, but again, for me, I overall, prefer the Rift S.",1574577368,f8hnmu8,t1_f8h6mix,/r/oculus/comments/dz9ztb/impressions_of_a_questlink_rift_s_all_nighter/f8hnmu8/,1,oculus,comment

As traffic grows, the reviewer can support his site and hopefully get an income.  And the company gets (hopefully) positive recommendations of their products.

Somehow it all works as long as the reviewer does not allow themselves to be unduly influenced by the company of the product they are reviewing.   So it all comes down to integrity and honesty so that it is not just advertising but a service to the reviewer's audience.",1574578477,f8hq78w,t1_f8hge5r,/r/oculus/comments/e0gzqr/uploadvr_now_has_bought_articles_this_is_bad/f8hq78w/,1,oculus,comment

3711,difficult_smile,t2_4ztndrd8,"1- No, the image clarity on quest is clearly inferior. Rift S has literally 50% more subpixel than Quest. The Quest's resolution increase is merely an attempt to fix the issues related to a Pentile stripe, which is known, objectively recognized, and generally shun upon. Have you ever wondered why Index has an LCD panel and not an OLED one? It's really hard to deny it, unless you never tried both, which is the feeling that i get from your posts.

This open the door to more issues related to the OLED monitor, such as the wake-up time of the pixels being too slow turn-off were enabled, creating the black smear phenomenon. Thus, this feature is disabled. But disabling it often causes the infamous red-dust or green-dust issue, and then you still have a contaminated image.

3 - You literally cannot achieve a decent framerate or resolution without image compression, with Quest. This is a hardware issue, and thus, unfixable. Rift S (or any other cabled HMD) does not risk visual artifacts, as Quest does (and will always do)

Really, it's ok if you like most Quest. It's a great machine. But I wouldn't allow my personal preference to blind me to the point of calling the other device ""redundant"" based only on rumors or lack of testing.",1574579041,f8hrhjk,t1_f8g0m2p,/r/oculus/comments/e0pn5r/can_updates_for_the_quest_make_the_rift_s/f8hrhjk/,1,oculus,comment

Most of my pains were just not knowing for example that I needed the new beta version of their software to use the index controllers, which wasn't widely made clear, but it seems to work as well as a vive for the most part in terms of running OK with most major games.  But I will grant it isn't perfect and there are some trade offs with the pimax.  Software is still a work in progress, mainly.  But it's gotten a lot better already and they open sourced it recently too.

All in all, I wouldn't trade my pimax for another headset at the present time.  But I do keep my vive wands on hand due to unsatisfactory backwards compatibility of the index controllers.

Heck, even older Intel i5s are not sufficient for high framerates https://youtu.be/s42gvVS77dU

And a modern Ryzen is faster with a GTX 1060 even than old i5s. So imagine how your A10 bottlenecks you.

And in VR you actually render 2 times at 90hz. Even 120hz eith an Index.

3857,president_josh,t2_ufrlc,"I'm 69 and it's challenging to see clearly easily. but it can be done. You just won't see clearly in both eyes at the same time. You may have to adjust your headset a lot depending on what you want to see clearly. That may not matter that much in games but if you're trying to read text or menus, you won't do that as easily as if you wore a headset like the Quest which has an adjustable IPD control. 

I also don't know if a 70 IPD is exponentially worse than a 69 IPD. I assume that it's worse though. I bought the Quest too but I mostly wear the Rift S because it's more comfortable. In doing that, I sacrifice clarity of vision. My theory, which could be wrong is that, maybe you could get an idea of what the Rift S might look like if you wear a headset that has no IPD control. That might be a $13 Walmart Cardboard headset that uses a phone. You shouldn't see clearly in that either since it probably has no IPD control. The Oculus Go has no IPD control so if you know someone who has a GO, put it on and try to read the Home screen menu items. You'll see the problem because of your IPD. 

Bottom line. I can make it work with a 69 IPD because I've lived with the problem going back to the Gear VR days. But I guess that with a 70 IPD, your problem may be worse. And I think there may be a point, perhaps in the 70s, where a headset may be unusual -- such as if IPD was 75, 76, etc. Or maybe 72 might do it. I don't know. I only know 69. 

Answer - You will encounter problems as in .. you won't see as clearly in both eyes at once as someone who has an IPD within the range that the Rift S supports.",1574592950,f8iv0kq,t3_e0wt9m,/r/oculus/comments/e0wt9m/thinking_about_buying_rift_s_with_ipd_70_can_you/f8iv0kq/,1,oculus,comment

Even if you don’t try and view this as a AAA title and temper your expectations it just comes up disappointed. For instance you can punch someone to knock them out barefisted but for some reason if I have a pistol and try to pistol whip someone while sneaking upon them it doesn’t even register properly.

3867,a_gilling,t2_9ubp99,"Summary for those who dont want to watch the video.

As im sure alot of you are already aware Boneworks is coming on December the 10th and seems to be a game that people either think is the second coming of christ or just a tech demo.

I sit somewhere in the middle, I can see alot of good things with this game its doing differently and also have some concerns and in this video I am going to go over the reasons why I think people are so hyped for this game and add my concerns at the end.

**Inverse Kinematics** \- The first thing this is doing well is the Inverse Kinematics, Inverse Kinematics arent new, We are seeing more and more games ditch the floating hands and give you a full body in VR with mixed results. Boneworks seems to be one of the best I have seen. You can see in the video the way the wrist and hand position seems perfect.

(I explain what Inverse Kinematics is in the video but wont go into it here as im sure most know what it is)

Having an in game body rather than floating hands can really add to the immersion, as long as it isnt completely off compared to our real world body.

**Full Physics Body** \- Not only is the body visible in VR in boneworks but its actually a full physics body. This means your body, not just your hands or head can interact and influence the enviroment. (I show some examples of this in the video) In the past we have seen games rely on you having to use your hands to open doors or even only being able to open a door on a single contact point like the door handle.

Having a full body will make moving and interacting with the enviroment more natural and we have already seen this with Blade and Sorcery but you can still ghost objects through your body and arms which isnt possible in Boneworks (again I show examples of this in the video) 

**Phyics everything** \- but it isnt just the body that is physics based. Everything is a phyics based object that reacts like it would in the real world. You cant ghost through walls or tables, Tables can be flipped. Objects have weight so heavier objects are harder to move around, this is done by adding a delay to your movements and the object moving which we have seen already in early VR games like robo recall. The developers at epic games added a slight delay to when you moved the shotguns to try to make them feel weighty, It was very subtle and worked really well and we are seeing this same thing applied more and more in games like Blade and Scorcery and the upcoming walking dead saints and sinners game.

This is exciting because it adds so many possibilitys to how the game can be played and we have already seen a strong community get behind blade and sorcery with people spending hours messing around in what is just a sandbox tech demo right now.

**Boneworks Engine** \- from my understanding Boneworks is using Unity for the graphics side of things but the physics engine, the inverse kinematics etc has all been made in house by stress level zero. This means they can potentially sell boneworks as a plugin for other developers to use so indie developers can make there own games with all the benefits of Boneworks but without having to spend the many many hours coding everything. This could open up the potential for a new wave of VR games with all of these features which has huge potential and is very exciting. There has been no word on this from the develpers though so it will be interesting to see how that side of things develops.

**Half life 2 vibes** \- Another reason this game is getting so much hype is due to the similarities to Half Life, the developers havent shyed away from half life being an influence on the game design even showing the iconic crowbar and gravity gun in previous videos. It has a look and feel of a Valve game and people have even speculated about this being a valve game in disguise.

**Node Video** \- I think the last reason this game has built up such a lot of excitment within the VR community is down to the Videos made by Node showcasing the game. They did a really good job with the way they showed the gameplay highlighting all the reasons previously mentioned why this game could be a big deal and the Boneworks videos have gone viral.

I dont think there is one thing boneworks is doing better than any single game I think its a combination of all of these things that make it look like a really big step forward in many different ways and I cant wait to play it in December.

There are some concerns for me personally though, Mainly the actual content of the game. They have confirmed its going to have a story describing it as a narrative VR action adventure but no word on how long it will take and have been a little evasive on the steam forums when asked simply stating it varys from person to person. I understand it will vary but some sort of ball park figure would be good. If the singleplayer story is short and most of the game is just a physics based sandbox it will lose alot of appeal for me.

I personally prefer a game with progression and dont enjoy open ended sandbox games much but judging by Blade and Sorcery I may be in the minority on that one. They also have removed the shadows from the game as you can see in the latest trailer (shown in the video). The earlier footage has shadows and they even commented on the lighting in previous videos so its a little dissapointing to see the visuals take a step back although not a deal breaker and I understand its due to performance reasons as they are already pushing the CPU hard due to all the physics. I think an option to turn them on would be good even if its in some sort of advanced settings menu.

Lastly I have heard rumours the game is launching in early access, this is a personal thing but I dont like playing games with a single player campaign that are in early access, I prefer to wait for them to be finished so I can play through the final version of the game.

And thats it, hopefully some people found this interesting and I would be interested to hear what other peoples thoughts are on the game, are you excited or do you think its just a glorified tech demo?",1574593555,f8iwsd9,t3_e0x6qv,/r/oculus/comments/e0x6qv/summary_in_comments_boneworks_why_some_people_are/f8iwsd9/,1,oculus,comment

3890,SistrenTV,t2_3obzs3w,"What made me buy the Rift S over the Quest was the battery life on the Quest and a graphics [comparison video](https://youtu.be/btb0gJT200U).

The feature I love on the Quest is the portability and fact that it's wireless, but that doesn't suit my play style. I often play for around four hours at a time which wouldn't be possible on a Quest without charging it. But then you have that cable connected to it, whether it's connected to an outlet or a power bank. There is no tripping over the wire, but still annoying. 

I don't see why you would go buy link, stuff for charging the Quest and eventually the cable for 80$ that's coming for Quest when you can just plug in the Rift S cable and have all that immediately.

But it really depends on your needs and wants. 
Do you want to easily bring it to your friends or family? Do you want the freedom of no wires? Is the battery time not a problem for you? Maybe you have a small room and are incapable of playing by your PC? Then maybe the Quest is a better alternative for you.

But I wouldn't recommend buying a Quest just to pretend it's a Rift S.

The things I feel like I'm missing out on with the Rift S is bringing the headset to my brother to show him, or hand tracking that's coming to Quest soon. The Quest is getting some cool stuff but the advantages of the Rift S are better than the advantages of the Quest, in my opinion.

3908,Siccors,t2_398acx,"&gt; Star Citizen will be a huge milestone in the history of video games

Personally I expect by the time it is released it is outdated, simply because everyone is taking so long. 

&gt;  the developement of Star Citizen takes it's time 

But why didn't they realise this at CIG themselves? Why give release estimates which weren't even close? Literally telling something would be released in 2 weeks, which turned out to be more than half a year? That there are delays is fine, and kinda expected, but the size of the delays is just ridiculous. And always same story from fans: ""Everyone who has any experience in software development knows this would take so much time"". Then why didn't they realize this at CIG? In 2016 I was told by fan(boy)s that everyone knew it would take until 2017-2018 before it would be released, in 2017 I was told everyone knew it would take till 2018-2019 before it would be released, etc. The release is always 1-2 years in the future (okay, now more like 2-3 years).

And don't get me wrong: I also 'invested' €40 in it (worst investment ever :P), and would love to have a great game that I enjoy playing. But while I would love it, I don't believe in it anymore. Two major reasons for that: One is the delays, the other one are the details, and this is a prime example of that. They love making really detailed stuff. But they don't think if it makes sense for a gameplay perspective. I don't know current state of ships, since I haven't played for a long time, but at least when they first were released they were horrible to fly (even though I bought a HOTAS specifically for it). This was because they made detailed models of every ship, and then calculated with the trust of every single truster how the ship would behave (if you didn't have a fly-by-wire setup). Meanwhile E:D just made ships fly. One was more detailed, the other one was (imo) actually fun to play. Gameplay &gt; 'realism'.",1574597211,f8j8hm6,t1_f8iyjxn,/r/oculus/comments/e0sh75/watching_the_latest_star_citizen_video_reminded/f8j8hm6/,1,oculus,comment

Quest was designed as a standalone headset, so they had to do some minor sacrifices in comfort and play length wise. The Link is just an added (and welcomed) features but never accounted originally to be used for PCVR.

But as a cliff notes sort of thing, it's all equations using known formula from the real world such as friction, momentum, angular velocity, all that good stuff. 

Collision detection is it's own thing and is done in different ways depending on the objects involved and your performance requirements. 

Both of the above will have various forms of estimation/rounding depending on the games needs and performance requirements, that and the fact that computers aren't that great with fractions.

They just manage to push out games inbetween that only need what features are already available. This simply doesn't work with SC.

3970,SeconddayTV,t2_mdzba,"""Personally I expect by the time it is released it is outdated, simply because everyone is taking so long.""  

Well, part of why it's taking so long is actually them keeping it up to date (visually and technically)  

""But why didn't they realise this at CIG themselves?""  

They probably did, but failed or even refused to communicate it. Like I said, I am following the developement of the game for more than 5 years now and especially the years between 2015-2017 were full of wrong estimates and bad communication. Stuff was delayed for over a year and I think this was the point where many people lost faith in CIG.  
Over the past two years the communication by CIG has improved a lot though, there is a detailed roadmap about the upcoming features of the game and a quarterly release schedule for new patches.  
Sure, even with the roadmap features get delayed sometimes but at least they give an explanation on why a particular feature was delayed.  
Now on the gameplay side of things... well, I know that many people would prefer a more simple approach to some aspects of the game (like the flight model) but there is also a huge amount of people who enjoy just that, a more realistic approach of such things (not a huge fan of the flight model either, but it's decent). 
Fidelity is a huge part of Star Citizens identity and I know this isn't well received by everybody but I personally wouldn't be such a big fan of the project if it wasn't for all the crazy details in the game.",1574600624,f8jie3x,t1_f8j8hm6,/r/oculus/comments/e0sh75/watching_the_latest_star_citizen_video_reminded/f8jie3x/,1,oculus,comment

Pascal can do h.265 encoding just fine, even with HDR. I think even Maxwell can do h.265, but just 8 bits.

I'm pretty sure the reason h.264 is being used is because the decoder is faster when using h.264.

When folks spend too much on hardware they need things like this to help them justify it. Mark my words ""Have you tried it with the Index controllers?"" will be the retort to any criticism. 

Sadly, a great physics engine without a story isn't going to go to far and nothing I've seen in the gameplay hints to any sort of deep underlying narrative for me. Folks aren't talking, computers are being accessed,  other humans aren't about... the ""story"" seems to be one that is told by moving boxes and shoving stuff around.

4104,Aud4c1ty,t2_dmn6xih,"After trying the Quest + Link with Asgard's Wrath and Stormland, I can say with certainty that it'll be just fine with games like HL Alyx.  If you're at all interested in mobile VR, I'd get the Quest and kill two birds.  Because the Rift S is on sale soon, you'll probably end up spending about \~$100-$140 more to get the Quest and a link cable vs a Rift S.

But the Quest is what I'd recommend.  It's also the headset that Oculus is putting most of its future effort into (e.g. hand tracking), so, there's that too.  Plus, while the Rift S matches your IPD, if you have friends/family who want to try out VR, the Quest having the mechanical IPD slider is nice.

If you're uncertain, there are some graphics quality comparisons where someone took a camera to the lenses so you can get a sense of the image differences.

4113,Doc_Ok,t2_4mqsf,"Your link talks about a ""3D sensor,"" and this [camera speculation article](https://wccftech.com/2020-iphone-design-new-5g-camera-upgrades/) linked from your link specifically mentions a time-of-flight depth sensor. Those two mentions are consistent, but they are not what you probably think they are.

Specifically, it's not a stereo camera that could directly record stereoscopic video, which is what you probably mean by ""3d video."" It's a sensor package comparable to the Kinect-for-Xbox-One, meaning it directly creates a 3D map of the environment.

If such a 3D map is combined (texture mapped) with the RGB feed from a regular camera, it can in fact be used to create 3D reconstructions that can be viewed in VR, and they even have benefits over stereo recordings because they are truly three-dimensional, i.e., support (limited) motion parallax.

The issue is that that's not the 3D sensor's purpose, and it will therefore probably not work very well. If I were to guess, the 3D sensor will probably have a few hundred by a few hundred pixels, and a maximum distance of a few meters, because that's what's needed to support the AR applications Apple are most probably aiming for.",1574483482,f8dal1z,t3_e0chu0,/r/oculus/comments/e0chu0/3d_camera_on_the_next_iphone/f8dal1z/,1,oculus,comment

4161,RocksySS,t2_3tb7fr2x,"Your friend may be what Hong Kong people call cockroaches (Hong Kong people say that thugs are cockroaches), and the pollution police are their common means of external communication, but there is no actual evidence, just oral statements.Most of the Hong Kong mobs are students and underage. They don't understand what freedom and democracy are, and even don't understand the law. They are easily incited, just like the Red Guards. But they are good at using the Internet, plus the support of the United States, which is why you always hear their voices on the Internet. In the parade to support China, adults and middle-aged people are the majority, and they have more mature ideas.You only need to search for related images to prove this.

The NBA did not expel Morey. Adam Silver said that the NBA supports freedom, but they fired the Clippers captain, which is a double standard. They are obviously affected by the pressure from American political circles. Blizzard banned any political remarks, which is no problem, but they still withdrew some punishments, which is also the impact of US political pressure.

Since ancient times, the people's Republic of China has always had sovereignty over Tibet and Taiwan. During the period of the Republic of China, Tibet and Taiwan still had sovereignty. The people's Republic of China only inherited the territory of the Republic of China. By the way, the government of the Republic of China went to Taiwan and became the government of Taiwan.
You actually think that Tibet and Taiwan should not be Chinese territory. This is the negative impact of the American media on you. India also claims that they should have sovereignty over Tibet, but they are not even the same race.

I have already said it. Any evidence that the police pretend to be a mob is not meaningful. The parade that supports the police is the ordinary people, and in your mouth they become jokes? https://twitter.com/GDHKMBayArea/status/1145530180753973248

No, you don't need to say it out loud, as long as they suspect that you are a Chinese mainlander, they will attack you, just like the Japanese who were beaten by mobs. The police's family members will also be threatened and insulted, and their information will be sent to the Internet. Many police families were forced to live in the Mainland.

What is your way of observing government behavior? Are you a relevant government official? If you are not. That must be through the media.

4177,Reddituser703,t2_11504r,"The gameplay and traversal is the big attraction. If you dont care for it then SL isnt for you. I have 20 hrs in SL, the story is shallow, gameplay is repetitive, but I find traversal mechanics to be amazingly fun (slipstreaming, flying, climbing). 

Once you beat the main campaign (took me 7 hrs), then you repeat the 3 realms and fight the tempest in the terminus realm (took me another 6 hrs). Once that's done then you repeat. To fully beat the game's story, I envision it being 20+ hrs (see below)

Theres the weekly reset that drastically changes the island layout (the island layout is denser us the cycling world vs the campaign), and theres collectables that you can scan for audio log that gives background info to the story. If you beat the terminus that week (3 realms + terminus realm), then the game world the following week goes 1 step higher in difficulty (escalation level 1). That means more difficult and greater amount of enemies, but the gameplay is the same.

The only thing I havent done yet is the secret ending that occurs once you beat the terminus at escalation 2 difficulty. Once I do this I'll probably be done with the game, which I'll probably be at around 30 hrs.

Stormland isnt the big content game like Asgards wrath (which is better than SL), but imo SL it's still pretty good and a worthy title to have just for the traversal mechanics",1574487947,f8devrn,t3_e0dn0c,/r/oculus/comments/e0dn0c/thinking_about_refunding_stormlands/f8devrn/,1,oculus,comment

You're too far gone and ignorant. 

My original point stands: no governement agency was downvoting your comments. We the people on reddit and of everwhere else but China know you're spewing bullshit and we click downvote so we don't have to see. That's democracy at work. Free to shut down and ignore the Chinese Government and not bend to their will. No idea what else you've said because I'm doing what what I do every other time a Chinese cronny tries to spew BS about how great their Winnie the Pooh leader and his lacky's are... I ignore the bullshit.

However their official 5m cable will releae next year so for now the cables that work are not optimal and only 3m long at most.

A rift s or a linked quest can run all games on the oculus store and can also use steamvr and steam games and even viveport.

As for modding not dure what exactly you mean but you can run indie games that are not on a store and if a game is moddable like skyrim vr or beatsaber than you can mod it and a linked quest works just like a rift s.

4315,RocksySS,t2_3tb7fr2x,"You are only reluctant to face reality in many practical .Can only adopt the strategy of ""I don't look"".evidences.The economy of Hong Kong is declining. As Hong Kong's universities are occupied by mobs, university rankings are seriously declining. Shenzhen is accelerating in the complete replacement of Hong Kong's economy. The people who actually receive the loss are Hong Kong people, not mainland China.

Don't talk nonsense, you can send out the ""evidence"" you said. I can perfectly rebut them one by one. Your ""evidence"" comes from Western media such as BBC, CNN or US websites. This is a very single source of information. But I often read the news published in China and browse websites such as Twitter and youtube. So I can summarize more diverse information.For China.  A lot of western media evidence and 9/11 conspiracy theories, moon landing is bogus, ebola virus is made in the United States. There is no essential difference between these conspiracy theories.

Democracy is not the majority of people rejecting a few. You are not familiar with the concept of democracy. According to your point of view, the Germans slaughter Jews is also a kind of democracy.Then if China’s 1.3 billion people decide to suppress Hong Kong mobs, it’s also a democracy.

The focus of democracy is to allow all the different voices to be heard by the masses, Rather than banning minority views.You have to know that public opinion itself is the result of being manipulated by the government.When political parties within the United States compete with each other, public opinion can be diversified. But in the face of a country like China, whose rapid rise threatens the international status of the United States, different parties will reach a consensus. That is to curb the development of China.

The point is that the reddit mechanism leaves room for government operations. Just like youtube can cancel a channel subscription in the background. Reduce the number of clicks and the amount of playback of the video. Cancel the ad for the video. Reddit can also manually hide any comments that are not allowed after they are found.",1574498572,f8dmkbt,t1_f8djjc2,/r/oculus/comments/dzdd8s/the_vr_game_simulate_the_situation_of_hong_kong/f8dmkbt/,1,oculus,comment

AADT not only saves codec bandwidth, but it also saves latency  by making sure the encoder and decoder work on smaller images. While  these numbers are tuned for the Oculus recommended-specification  hardware, they might be updated for better visual fidelity in future  releases. 

This explains why in SteamVR it said 1808x200 per eye when set to 100% resolution. Good to see some additional confirmation that there may b exposed settings for the values in the future, it sure would be nice to be able to send something better than a 1008x1120 image to the 1440x1600 displays.

4368,_i_see,t2_3yer0hmz,"About Motion Sickness:

Got a Rfit S four days ago. Just wanted to try it out, mostly because Valve is making a full fledged single player VR game. Sorry Oculus games team, but that is what gave me the last push I needed. Still, I bought Lone Echo. First, it is a mind-blowing experience! I'm on a space station in space. Holy \*\*\*\*! 

But motion sickness was a huge problem on my first day with the game. Only played for a couple of minutes and I was done, even felt sick for an hour afterwards. On my second day I tried out a bit less mobile games like Batman VR, Rick and Morty and a couple demos. On my third day I was able to do slow movement in Lone Echo, grab things and enjoy the experience more (\~45 minutes). On my forth day I'm browsing through the station and am even able to rotate myself while doing so. It is still not 100% fine, but already better. I'll ""train"" more in the coming days, but this ""I tried VR and was motion sick"" stuff. Yes, most people will have problems on day one (AND you really need to be careful!) But our brains are excellent at adapting and learning, you will (most likely) overcome it. 

I'm always motion sick the first day while sailing (not doing it enough) too. Many people are, but I never witnessed more than three days.

&amp;#x200B;

Could somebody please recommend me good, not expansive, over ear headphones please. In-ear never felt comfortable and is falling out. My PC headset is comfortable but doesn't fit over the Rift S. And the Rift S sound isn't as terrible as some people say, but it's also not good either.",1574503528,f8dpjh9,t3_e0bf8e,/r/oculus/comments/e0bf8e/and_pancake_games_are_discriminatory_to_blind/f8dpjh9/,1,oculus,comment

I still take a cautious approach when talking about simsickness as I’ve noticed when demoing to people they are clearly simsick but the wow factor overused that.

This is an incremental upgrade, and in some ways a ""sideways"" upgrade. I recommend people who already have a Rift to not upgrade now, but for those who are thinking about getting a headset to get the Rift S.  
&gt;  
&gt;That being said, we are already putting the finishing touches on the next headset. Hardware is mostly locked down, and its vastly improved over the Rift S. I don't want to give away too many details, but you won't have to wait another 3 years for a Rift upgrade. It's coming next year!

That's the same with VR. You're going from something flat with no perspective to actually being in the game itself. You really can't explain that feeling to people  - they have to experience it.

4493,grumbel,t2_4iv60,"&gt; It might turn out that Cardboard et al. poisoned the VR well more than we would have liked to admit back then.

What poisoned VR was raising the launch price of the Rift to $600. That's the exact moment when VR went from being the next big thing to ""fuck this shit"" for a hell of a lot of people. Quality of Cardboard was never a problem, since nobody expected a $5 headset to provide an amazing experience. The problem was that there was nothing affordable to replace that Cardboard with.

That's a problem that persists to this day, HP Reverb, Vive Pro, Cosmos, Index, Pimax all *raised* the price of VR instead of lowering it. Even Rift S managed to raise the price from the late CV1s. WMRs are the only ones that got really cheap, but even they only got cheap after they didn't sell with their initially high launch price and lack of advertisement ensured that nobody outside of VR circles ever knew they exist. On top of that they are all going out of stock now or haven't even been available outside the USA, so another increase of the price of entry-level VR is ahead of us.

Now it's not like there weren't problems with the quality of the experience. PSVR recycling the old Move controllers was a mistake. Google continuing phone-VR with Daydream instead of moving straight to a Go/Quest self-contained design was another. But overall it all comes down to price and content, that's where VR continues to fail, quality of the headset is really a secondary concern.",1574512576,f8dx9id,t1_f8dattw,/r/oculus/comments/e0bf8e/and_pancake_games_are_discriminatory_to_blind/f8dx9id/,1,oculus,comment

4507,AJBats,t2_d9y90,"Who said I was disappointed about Half Life Alyx? I'm freakin thrilled. What's I was in my first post was frustrated at their reasoning behind not finishing the story they left on a cliffhanger. I didn't know Half Life 2 destroyed them, but like, that's a fixable problem right? Reign in the crunch. Set a looser schedule. Give people a year away from the project. Lord knows they can afford all three of those things. As horrifying of a crunch that must have been, I can tell they've recovered from it, since they've made Portal 2. But listen to what he said in the interview, he didn't say ""we were all just so devastated from working endlessly"", he said they were intimidated by half life 3. I am \*not\* one of the ""half life 3 confirmed"" memers who is putting them into a lose-lose scenario. I'm just a normal gamer, who wanted a conclusion to the cliffhanger from ep 2, who was expecting a fun shooter, like they always consistently make. I wasn't expecting the second coming. No game can be that. The fact that they had to trick themselves into working on half life again by doing it in a prequel is very curious and revealing to me. They have totally psyched themselves out over 3. It'll just be a another video game at the end of the day, and there's no reason they can't approach it with the same kind of development they used to create Half Life Alyx. 

I mean, hell, take this game that they literally just made, throw in a cutscene that says ""we thought we had to go north, but looks like we need to teleport back to city 17!"", and then some more cutscenes to tie up loose ends. Bam, that's your 3. Like, it could be done. It's not a boogie man.

People who spent upwards of $2000 on their PCs with high end GPUs and multiple 4K monitors. Then having a freakout because they might have to spend at MOST $400 on a Rift-S which will be a pretty decent experience.

If they want high end they can go an Index but lowering your standards to a Rift-S isn't going to ruin the experience. You will have a smaller e-peen compared to your peers which I suspect is their biggest fear.

I'd say once it's out peer pressure will budge a lot of them as they will not want to be left behind. There will be the stubborn who remain on the sidelines though.

I have to agree on Link though, i get better image quality, better colours and better black levels with Virtual Desktop compared to Link with only 1 frame higher latency.
And people need to stop sayig ""it's just a beta chill"", betas are made for feedback, if everyone just ignores flaws then they won't know what to improve.
As a first beta release it's alright but the 150mbps encoder limit could be a huge problem, if VD can cut down even more an latency then Link will be in a weird spot at least for me.
You can buy VD, a great router and a powerbank that will last you 7-8 hours for less than the official Link cable.

4575,Ickyptang,t2_qo0pxpn,"I tried it out with my Surface Book 2 15”, and TL:DR - same issue as you, and Link won’t start on the headset, but I’m cautiously optimistic it will be updated to work as the beta progresses/moves to final (but it could also never be supported). Full explanation here:

I got the Anker cable recommended by Oculus Link Support site (https://support.oculus.com/444256562873335/), which is a USB-A 3.0 to USB-C cable, plugged everything in to my Surface Book 2 15”, and the Oculus App went through the setup without issue. In the headset itself I clicked “Enable Oculus Link (beta)” (in the Quest settings), and it kept kicking me back multiple times. Eventually I unplugged the USB cable from the computer, plugged it back in, the screen went dark, came back on, and asked if I wanted to give the device access. I clicked  ok, and then tried to clicking the “Enable Oculus Link” button in the settings again - and it said “PC Not Detected”. I unplugged again, plugged it back, this time clicked “deny” and hit the “enable” button in the settings again - same result (PC not detected). I did this a few times, then decided to restart the computer - since I also had the same red band error (more on that shortly).

After restarting, I opened the Oculus app with the headset still connected, and in the headset a window came up asking me if I wanted to enable Link - that was different and seemed good, since I did not get this pop up previously. I clicked enable... and it went briefly black, then back to the home screen, with no change. So, not so good, after all. I tried hitting the “enable” option in the settings again, it went black, then back to the home screen. After doing this a few times, it popped up again with “PC Not Detected.” So, I’m going in circles.

The thing is: the Oculus app on my computer says the headset is set up properly and indicates it IS connected - so I know the cable and connection works, but it just won’t start Link on the headset. As indicated above, I ALSO have the red error bar in the Oculus app about “encountering an error” and suggesting I restart, BUT, that has ALWAYS been in my Oculus app since well before Link was even  announced (I tried setting up a Rift-S on my surface book right after it was released, and that error came on and never went away). I don’t know if the error is related or not, but since it’s always been there (before Oculus Link), I’m thinking it’s not related... but the fact that Link isn’t working may be related to the GPU.

That Oculus support website I have linked up there has a compatibility list indicating what cards are and are not supported. The 1060 DESKTOP version is supported - 1060m is not (currently). This is likely why it’s not working - but there are a few things to note about that:

1. There technically is no 1060m, as far as I know - and the Surface Pro 2 card is definitely not branded as 1060m. Nvidia has branded both the desktop and laptop versions of the 1060 with the same name, because they are extremely similar (same memory, same number of shader units, etc.)... but they are not exactly the same (the mobile version is slightly less powerful in a few areas, including clock speed). That said, the desktop and mobile versions of other cards on the list are both supported.

2. The site indicates that as the beta progresses, they will be (hopefully) moving more GPU’s to the “supported” column - and not long ago the desktop 1060 was unsupported, too. That changed fast - and the fact that the mobile 1060 is still unsupported, but they are so similar, means it may be supported soon... but there is no guarantee.

3. Upload VR has an article (https://uploadvr.com/oculus-link-beta-supported-gpus/) which hypothesizes that the reason the mobile version is not supported is because Nvidia’s NVENC chip, specifically for video encoding, which Link may be using to get the appropriate video/data to transfer over USB 3.0. This is entirely a guess (though not a bad one) and UploadVR says that the desktop 1060 has the chip, but not the mobile 1060 - which may be the problem. This is also a guess... and I’m not convinced the 1060 mobile variant doesn’t have the NVENC chip. The UploadVR article references an Nvida site about the chip (https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-decode-gpu-support-matrix), which UploadVR says does not list the 1060m... but that page lists the 1060 twice. It is very possible that one of those two is the 1060m (especially since, as noted, the 1060m technically doesn’t exist - they’re both just called 1060). There are other m-branded cards there, though - so it is possible that the mobile variant of the 1060 is absent... however, next to both of the 1060 entries, in a section for “Desktop/Mobile/Server,” BOTH entries say D/M (for desktop and mobile). Other “m” entries (like 1070m/1080m) ONLY list M in that column. The 1080 (not 1080m) also lists D/M. This is very unlikely to be a mistake in the chart, and that implies, to me, that the mobile 1060 used in the Surface Pro 2 (which, again, is NOT branded as 1060m) does have the NVENC. That is entirely a guess on my part, though, and is no more valid than the UploadVR guess.

Anyway - all of this is to say that I am still cautiously optimistic that in a month or two the 1060m may become supported. If and when it is, if it still doesn’t work on the Surface Book 2, we can get reaching out to Oculus to find out what gives.

In the meantime, I’ll be periodically plugging my headset back in and trying it out again.",1574393909,f8ad0df,t1_f85ge4h,/r/oculus/comments/det1rl/through_oculus_link_will_my_surface_book_2_be/f8ad0df/,1,oculus,comment

4592,Nikolai_Volkoff88,t2_1hgj8se,"If you are even remotely interested in playing anywhere you want, wirelessly, I have to say I think you should go for a Quest.  I just spent the last hour playing Defector on the Quest using the Oculus Link Beta and I am pretty impressed.  I have a Valve Index, which I got after returning the Rift S.  The Quest looks pretty damn good if you have a good PC, and will only get better as the Beta moves forward to full release.  Having an IPD adjustment and the ability to take it on the go makes it an easy decision over the Rift S for me.  Obviously it will not be quite as sharp as the Rift S or Valve Index, but Defector looked and played amazingly on the Quest.  Please note that I have modded my Quest quite a bit to make it comfortable.  I have the Vive Deluxe audio strap installed as well as the StudioForm strap and a silicon cover over the face pad.  With this setup it is pretty comfortable, but not perfect.",1574394828,f8ae7rf,t3_dzv803,/r/oculus/comments/dzv803/oculus_rift_s_or_oculus_quest/f8ae7rf/,1,oculus,comment

PC native headsets, like your WMR Explorer and Rift S,  connect to both your OC usb 3 port and your GPU.

Whereas, Quest ONLY connects to a USB port. Thus, all the data it s transmitted over a single usb cable, which limits the visual fidelity of the Quest+Link 

Saying that, Quest is still a good headset. But its primarily a standalone (no wires) headset. If you want standalone capabilities with the occasional PC game, Quest+Link may be for you.

4714,mimomusic,t2_11leos,"Let's be honest: Valve has so far been pretty concealed. Yeah, they did Lab and SteamVR is impressive despite its shortcomings, nevermind all the hardware efforts - but especially when talking about gameplay literals like the ubiquitous tele-grab (which some games like Pavlov still haven't discovered) and all the other things we've seen in the trailer, someone else did it first, probably in a concerted effort. EG has done plenty stuff with Robo Recall, handling physical puppets alone is something we've figured out decently.

As far as the trailer is concerned, there is nothing innovative. The real big one here is them making it fun, iterating on what we know already. Half-Life 1 wasn't the huge pioneering shooter either, as much as people want to remember it as such, it just did everything we knew about fps games really, really well.

In-universe integration of VR mechanics are just part of the polish and bound to feel amazing. Also, sick atmospheric scattering effects and backlight wrapping around subjects.

4720,SemiActiveBotHoming,t2_13y9whqw,"&gt; That's great and all but this is mostly about Oculus making it difficult in the first place. We want them to open up their store so this kind of thing isn't necessary in the first place.

IIRC there were a couple of games early on that shipped on Steam after being developed with only support for LibOVR, which ended up officially supporting ReVive - this is what I was referring to in my original post.

If Oculus added Vive/Index support by proxying to SteamVR, I'd expect a large number of the issues SteamVR has would apply to it - what we really need is for more people to use OpenXR, and Valve to hurry up and implement it.

(obviously this won't help exclusivese where they intentionally don't work on other hardware - no API can solve this)

&gt; That sucks but the same can be said for ReVive, but at least with steam you can open a Ticket to valve and get help about it, since the Oculus is officially supported. It is still fundamentally different.

For those games (I forget which ones they were) you could ask the developer if you were having issues with ReVive, as they officially supported it.

&gt; Now all this being said, and to make it clear I am not a SteamVR ""fanboy"" I know the pain of SteamVR, even if it *does* work as expected. Even if you own an Index SteamVR is a pile of garbage, so a lot of the issues are not as a result of using a different headset anyway.

I actually haven't had that many issues with it on the Vive. It would crash on (relatively rare) occasion and of course it didn't have Dash and PTW and all that cool stuff, but it was functional and I was able to actually play games on it fairly reliably.

This issue seems specific to SteamVR's Rift driver, which is where my complaints mainly lie.",1574402750,f8an2uf,t1_f8am9pe,/r/oculus/comments/dzn51m/halflife_alyx_announcement_trailer/f8an2uf/,1,oculus,comment

Hi! I was wondering if I could pick your brain for a sec -- Alyx has reinvigorated my thirst to buy a VR headset and I'm sussing between Rift S and Quest. Since you've had both, I was wondering -- in terms of screen quality / refresh rate, do you prefer the Rift S or the Quest w/ Link? Watched countless YouTube videos last few hours and not many specify which screens they prefer. I had a buddy lend me his Vive for a week so I've had a bit of experience with playing for VR.

4837,akiskyo,t2_45jyi,"first, your assumption is wrong, as I have been a day-0 vr enthusiast, first with the DK2 then with the CV1 (and thinking about a S upgrade, but I'm waiting for the Quest+Link hype to see if it could be worth it for the unthetered experience of the Quest). I don't see any reason on why I should justify myself about it to you, but I have some free time so I decided to play your stupid ""bigger penis"" game.

Second, your in depth explanation, although technically partially accurate, is completely unrelated to the issue here. The Rift is not unusable in SteamVR as you describe. you don't need any nasa hardware, you just get some ""slight"" performance decrease, which is something Valve has some interest in fixing in the future (if at least oculus keeps supporting its hardware, which it is doing in a very poor manner). So from a commercial point of view, they have some ""minor"" performances to fix and a big game release. Why would you invest money to make your game compatible with third party APIs instead of using the same money to fix your performance issue and push your own API even more on the market? Of course this is purely theoretical, as they can actually push their API without investing any money in fixing performances on a different hardware, but that is supposing Valve is evil, and that is false until proven otherwise by facts and I personally can't prove or disprove it, so ""innocent until proven"" still stands.",1574411855,f8au117,t1_f89fi0c,/r/oculus/comments/dzn51m/halflife_alyx_announcement_trailer/f8au117/,1,oculus,comment

Flip this reasoning around and it's exactly why I personally went with the Index as my first set of VR hardware.

I strongly believe in the modularity and upgradeability of the SteamVR ecosystem.

Let's say there comes a new type of controller that's way better than all others in some way in a few years. I won't have to buy an entire new kit to use it. Instead, I can just swap out the controllers.

Same goes for the HMD.

I'll likely never have to buy new base stations unless they get damaged somehow.

4946,Clavus,t2_4ydw4,"&gt; One of the complaints against VR has always been the supposed lack of AAA titles; while I don't agree with that mentality and think that both PCVR and PSVR have already gotten AAA quality material, an original entry in a highly regarded series like this is something people will have a much harder time writing off.

I think what VR gaming still lacks is a platform-defining game. I'd say the closest we've come is something like Beat Saber, but that mainly serves the more 'casual' side of the audience. Oculus is on the right path with games like Stormland, Lone Echo and Asgard's Wrath but none of them are true stand-outs just yet, usually because they're still quite limited in scope or because they don't push the boundary all that much except for production value.

Valve's entire portfolio is stacked with critically acclaimed titles so it's hard not to get excited about their take on VR.

It has more polish than your average indie game, but polish aside the trailer really didn't look much different than your average shooting gallery. The small environments and lack of locomotion in the trailer is also worrisome.

5034,VRIceblast,t2_w6lqk,"Yeah, I've been looking at the Quest for a long while, but decided on the Rift S.

Mobility doesn't really do anything for me, because I rarely leave the house, and if I get the Link, then you're back to using a cable playing VR, which kills mobility.

IPD shouldn't be a problem for me.

The Quest being front heavy, and having to rely on battery life to play, is a issue to me. Because I don't trust batteries lifespans that much, and if the battery dies, you can't replace it, so you're screwed.

While the Rift S is suppose to be comfortable, and you shouldn't have trouble playing for hours on end.

I'm planning to buy the video card, whether I buy a VR headset or not.

Also, $350 for the Rift S on Black Friday is a Plus.

5040,SoulBun,t2_4av2bvl1,"The question is a little bit broad, but you plug it into your graphics cards display port and into a USB port, download the Oculus software and steam VR if you want to play steam games and you're set. You'll want a graphics card like a GTX1050ti or higher for the games and at least a modern CPU.

Alternatively in the Rift S case it uses some kind of 3D mapping of your room/ play area to track the headset with it's cameras and then also uses the headsets cameras to track the controllers via IR lights emitted from them that flash at different frequencies. 

If you do get a Rift S and your specs are up to par but you find that you loose tracking completely sometimes or get static/ snow looking stuff on your screen this can be fixed by purchasing and installing a USB expansion card in your pc, the recommended ones are basically anything with a Fresco L1100 chipset like this one: [https://www.amazon.com.au/Inateck-Superspeed-Ports-PCI-Expansion/dp/B00B6ZCNGM](https://www.amazon.com.au/Inateck-Superspeed-Ports-PCI-Expansion/dp/B00B6ZCNGM)",1574307569,f86uytg,t3_dzd1g3,/r/oculus/comments/dzd1g3/how_do_pc_based_vr_headsets_work/f86uytg/,1,oculus,comment

5047,trankillity,t2_qcptb,"All fair points :) Sounds like you've done your homework. I'm not sure if you should go the 2070 Super or the 1660 Super honestly. I would have said ""go the 2070"" easily before, but they've already teased the next generation of GPUs, and with a new gaming console launch cycle next year, there's likely to be a pretty significant leap forward.

I ended up buying a gaming laptop recently with a RTX 2060 in it and while it was a monumental upgrade from my previous card (GTX 970), it still runs at a crawl with ray tracing on. I anticipate that the next generation of GPUs will handle ray tracing MUCH better than the 20xx range, as it's a major feature of next gen consoles.

In terms of HMD, If you actually have a friend with a Quest though - I'd still recommend giving it a shot (especially if you can borrow it to test on your environemtn).

With the tethered vs. tetherless issue, there is actually a way to play PCVR games wirelessly using VirtualDesktop/ALVR/Riftcat. You do need a good 5ghz AP that is near to your play area, but it works pretty well. The only part that's not great is that Oculus games have to run through Revive, which adds some latency on top of the latency that already gets added for being wireless. So basically native SteamVR games run near flawlessly, but games through the Oculus store are noticably choppy/laggy.",1574308152,f86vs9m,t1_f86umye,/r/oculus/comments/dzcl5w/planning_on_getting_the_rift_s_this_black_friday/f86vs9m/,1,oculus,comment

5092,JCatNY,t2_dvodj,"That's interesting and further proof how everyone is different. I found the CV1, Rift S and PlayStation VR to be the most comfortable 3 headsets I've used since the days of DK1. The Vive felt front heavy - never could get comfortable, so I had a total of 17 days owning that before I flipped to CV1. 

As much as I love the Quest, I just can't get it to sit right without me constantly fiddling with it. I've tried every variation and recommendation based off suggestions and videos. It just feels like it's either being held up by my nose, or the bottom of my eyes (anyone see Clockwork Orange?) after 15-20 minutes. 

I'm dying for a solution. The comfort strap has become harder to find unless you want to pay double than what it was. I would love to spend more time in the Quest. That is the one drawback I want solved for good! That's me though. I've talked with people who found the Quest to be comfortable.",1574311112,f86zknb,t1_f86xkro,/r/oculus/comments/dz9ztb/impressions_of_a_questlink_rift_s_all_nighter/f86zknb/,1,oculus,comment

5152,Tarquinn2049,t2_bp52h,"The nice thing about hitting min spec for VR is it also happens to pretty much coincide with the hardware you would use for 1440p. So you wouldn't be building a PC for VR exclusively, you would be building it for gaming.

So basically anyone not interested in 4K gaming yet is likely already at that level of hardware, if they have recently bought a PC. Because you can have something that was midrange 5 years ago and still run new games at 1080p.

And if you have a computer that can do 4k gaming, you have a very capable VR machine already. Which again, is getting surprisingly accessible. That can be had for under $1000 USD already. But again that's if the game launches soon. The main thing is, the bar for entry into VR hasn't moved, Oculus deliberately made their new PC headset target the exact same hardware as the last one. And the games are already made to that spec too. So that will have been 6 years straight by the time the Rift S is replaced that the entry level VR system was held still. We still have 2 and a half years of that time now.

In a very generalizing manner to describe the viewing experience of the Quest+Link would be like a CV1 with the same vibrant colors, slightly more defined edges and slightly increased FOV the enough to feel like not looking thru a ski-google, but slightly more ghosting when doing super fast motions. However, Rift S still have that clarity jump that I feel I would much prefer to have. Besides, as amazing as untethered VR can be, at the end of the day I'm using using VR main in my four walls, so the Quest being portable and can do VR anywhere really is not a deciding factor to me.

They can transform a sparse pixel view to a full one in realtime for use in VR and AR. They show it using 5-10% of the pixels initially and the results are just amazing.
What I want to know is what do they use to run it? At what resolution and framerate?

I'm reading the paper but haven't finished it yet. It looks like a simple UNet model so I guess the important part is the loss functions, notably the visual flow loss that should avoid flickering.

We might see a Quest 2 sometime in the next years that would be able to render 4K per eye at PC quality but it's not even the most exiting thing IMO.
We could render games on PC in a quality way above current AAA games (think photorealism), stream it wirelessly (as it would take 90% less bandwidth) and fill the gaps on the headset itself with an ASIC chip.

There are a significant number of players in the PC version of Destiny 2 that are Chinese now (its a Steam game now).

So, it's possible they don't want to step on any toes. I mean, just recently both Activision-Blizzard and the NBA were under fire for bowing down to Chinese influence, particularly in a way that had an affected things outside of China.

It's also possible that Valve just doesn't want something so political on their platform at the moment, since it isn't as satirical as other content that has been allowed.

There are a number of weird content rules on many platforms as of late, because of the cureent political climate. Facebook is in the news everyday getting heat for some of their decisions on political ads and such, Twitter a bit less so, YouTube has been under fire from content creators, viewers, and politicians for a number of their curation practices.

idk though and it's not really the point of the experience either, which is to draw more attention to the massive protests, the human rights abuses (indiscriminate arrests, beatings, torture, rape, etc. by HK law enforcement and other actors on behalf of the CCP), as well as other elements of the situation in HK.",1574325832,f87cd00,t1_f876x5d,/r/oculus/comments/dzdd8s/the_vr_game_simulate_the_situation_of_hong_kong/f87cd00/,1,oculus,comment

I'm aware that shielding, twisting and kinks affect cabling. Also what affects USB 3/ USB-C cabling is whether or not is has the required circuitry and resistors in it to properly negotiate the connection and capability of it.

This is partly why most cables you buy will either work or not work, but if you have a cable which is various metals other than gold, you're probably not going to see much of a difference in using a gold cable.

Either way I believe we're both in agreement that cables for USB vary far too much, they need to be held to a standard, like cat5/5e/6 cabling is for networking, with statements as to whether or not its shielded, or twisted, etc. Then we'd be able to make a better choice.

The DeepFovea model has 3.1 million parameters and requires 111 GFLOP with 2.2GB memory footprint per GPU for an inference pass. ... Time to sparsify a frame on a single GPUis 0.7ms.

The issue is not really related to when the headset was launched (3.5 years ago) it is when the last headset was sold. I feel bad for people that bought their headsets in March 2019. They will get warranty support then thats it. Game over. No spares.

That doesn't even take into account people who bought a CV1 in march and have a cable failure due to no fault of Oculus. ie pet chewing the cable. Oculus should not be expected to replace it free but your average consumer would definitely expect to be able to replace a consumable part.

Already left a review over at Viveport for it, and it's rare that I take the time to review a game.

And now that I've seen it, I cannot UNsee it. 😀 )

5576,TonyDP2128,t2_oh4bb,"It's difficult to do an A/B comparison since the screen in a VR headset is inches from your eyes. Primarily for that reason, the resolution won't appear as good as a 1080p flat panel viewed from several feet away. VR headsets also don't have HDR, brightness or contrast controls or other video processing features you may take for granted on a traditional flat panel.

The other limitation you'll run into is the field of view. Unless you go really high end there is no escaping a certain degree of binocular style field of view when in the headset.

All that said, the resolution of the Rift S coupled with its 3x subpixel design means that it has a very crisp image. Even small text is easily legible and the screen door effect that plagued earlier headsets is all but gone. The sense of immersion in VR also really helps mitigate any drop in resolution or limits in FOV.

5615,Tech_AllBodies,t2_ensun,"&gt; I haven't even experienced 4K VR, so I can't say for sure, but according to my math, you'd need 16K at least before the eye is physically unable to notice improvements.

There's 2 variables here, the amount of pixels per eye and the FOV. (and the Hz too, to a much lesser extent)

The true metric to use to determine screen clarity is pixels-per-degree (PPD), e.g. a 1000x1000 screen filling 100 degrees of your vision is 10 PPD.

And whether your eyes can see the difference then depends on what visual phenomena you are talking about.

But the TL;DR is along the lines of:

* ~35 PPD (e.g. 3850x3850 per eye with 120 FOV, 110 stereo-overlap) is the point the screen-door should properly completely disappear for people with remotely normal vision (i.e. average to above-average). Similar to how a 27"" 1080p screen looks at ""normal"" viewing distance (2 feet ish).

* ~50 PPD is the point at which clarity is very high and diminishing returns begin. Similar to how a 27"" 1440p screen looks at normal viewing distance, and this combination is currently considered very high clarity and 'premium' for gaming PCs.

* ~70 PPD is the point where hard diminishing returns begin. Similar to how a 28"" 4K screen looks at normal viewing distance. This size/resolution combo is normally seen as excessive/sub-optimal for PCs, as 4K at 28"" is very small without scaling options, and usually 32"" would be better overall, and then lower than 70 PPD.

* ~120 PPD is the point where only a very small % of people would be able to tell any difference, and only with certain visual phenomena. This is similar to holding a high res smartphone (e.g. Galaxy S10) about 12 inches away from you. Obviously in that scenario there's no way you'll see any artifacts in the S10's screen based on pixel count/PPD, 120 PPD is absurdly high.",1574224957,f83yx5d,t1_f81pg1t,/r/oculus/comments/dyj2rk/facebooks_deepfovea_ai_promises_powerefficient_vr/f83yx5d/,1,oculus,comment

5617,Reddituser703,t2_11504r,"Palmer mentioned the PSVR *once* in his article. He says the PSVR has a wide enough sweetspot as a trade off for having the static IPD. He further justified the PSVR being adequate because it's only a $199 headset. 

Thus, I'm not seeing the issue ? With my 68mm IPD, the sweet spot on the Rift S is large enough for me. Same with the PSVR.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nothing is perfect, but .  It is possible to design optical systems with  a very wide sweet spot/eyebox and little need for physical adjustment,  but not without tradeoffs.  **Playstation VR** is a good modern example,  using solid and heavy lenses with a fairly long focal length to create  an wide enough eyebox for most users.  This comes with a penalty to  weight, cost, size and panel utilization (and thus resolution), but it  is hard to argue with the results, especially for a headset that  regularly sells for $199",1574224977,f83yxye,t1_f83xl6a,/r/oculus/comments/dyrymq/i_am_really_struggling_to_choose_between_the/f83yxye/,1,oculus,comment

5645,TayoEXE,t2_3twq068,"The problem, though, is that even if you can build a PC exclusively for playing VR on minimum specs, why would you? If I'm going to invest in a good PC to run VR with ease and that is more future proof, going with the minimum requirements would mean you get a worse experience that will also be likely to become more obsolete faster. If you can afford to invest in such a device and VR, especially if you're thinking of developing for it or learning how to, you might as well go for something bigger. That means more time spent saving up money. Not exactly very accessible. I've got a future to consider like my family, a car, and paying off loans, for example, so I'm working on side stuff to help save up for a good PC to build. Even if I want it, it's out of my reach for now. I do have to agree that it does make this more exclusive (even though I love that it's being built for VR, even if I don't have the PC to run it yet), so the anger is also understandable. I hope it does push more people to save and invest in VR, though.

5685,drakfyre,t2_46apm,"Now that I've tried the Link system for Quest, there's no way I'd ever recommend Rift S over Quest.  I don't specifically own both though, but I have a friend who has a Rift S.

Rift S is *not* a bad system at all though.  It's just that the Quest's native VR stuff just *works* and I love that, and now that you can hook it into a PC for a quality PCVR experience.

If you really have a VR dedicated space figured out that's near your PC and you don't see yourself playing outside of that space, the Rift S is going to give you a slightly better experience.  But you can use the Quest in a lot of places, and pairing it with Virtual Desktop, you can use your computer wherever your Quest is, and you can even stream VR games without a cable.

Not to mention you can play through Half Life right now on the Quest, from start to finish, with proper VR controls too.  And this is a native app so you don't even need a computer to do so (Though you need a computer to get the files onto the Quest in the first place).",1574229091,f84386c,t3_dyx4sf,/r/oculus/comments/dyx4sf/still_deciding/f84386c/,1,oculus,comment

5695,FlugMe,t2_i957d,"DO NOT get the Quest for PC VR. I've been using it today and it's not great. The Rift S is likely to be far more comfortable than the Quest and look much better visually. Unfortunately due to the nature of how the Quest Link system works you get video encoding artefacts in your VR content no matter how good your PC is. I don't think this going to go away either and there's not much that can mitigate these problems as there's going to be a limit to the video bitrate on either the nvidia NVENC block or the Snapdragon 835 decoder in the quest headset. People will yell up and down ""But it's beta, it's BETA"", yes it's beta software but I don't think you're going to get a magic bullet to fix this one, it's just an inherit part of video encoding tech.

From the second I started using link I could tell something was off, everything had that lossy video encoding ""edge"" to it, and then I played the desert map in Arizona sunshine, holy heck the red rock just turns to gross mush (this is because video codecs generally put lower emphasis on red as they do the other colours, which our eyes are more sensitive to).

5697,SoulBun,t2_4av2bvl1,"Common sense hey. Common sense would dictate that not everyone’s play space can work well with sensors. In my case there was literally no way to set them up in a way that gave both decent 360 tracking and floor level tracking due to a small playspace and objects like bed and desk blocking stuff. The rift S on the other hand doesn’t get blocked by any objects, floor tracking and 360 are perfect out of the box without purchasing a third sensor.

Not to mention all it takes is a quick look around to find that the rift s tracking vs the cv1 is only slightly different in most use cases. I never stated it as a fact. I stated it as my experience with it. Not everyone is allowed to just mount shit on their walls or has the room to even do so, and by that logic for a lot of people the rift s is simply better.  I used sensor setup and everything and trust me the experience has just been less hassle and better in general for me. I loved my cv1 but this has just been a better overall experience bar audio quality which is easily fixed. 

TL:DR CV1 tracking is great if you can set it up well to suit your playspace but the rift s tracking is pretty much the same in almost all cases without effort or extra money.  And if your space doesn’t suit sensors it is just better. Not to mention I can still grab stuff from behind me with a rift s without issue in normal play.",1574230575,f844ljl,t3_dyrymq,/r/oculus/comments/dyrymq/i_am_really_struggling_to_choose_between_the/f844ljl/,1,oculus,comment

5703,SoulBun,t2_4av2bvl1,"I have common sense. The moment you say huge playspace your argument for why it’s better goes out the window. I have a small playspace and you just could not set the sensors up in a way that didn’t get either blocked by objects, loose floor tracking or have them basically on top of you. Rift s tracking avoids all of these issues and doesn’t require money for a third sensor for decent 360 and large room scale tracking. Sorry not all of us have perfect large rooms for VR with places to mount sensors.  

Also, this guy is buying a rift s or quest so this doesn’t even matter. Tracking works great and that’s all that matters really for most people. I can grab stuff from behind me fine on the rift s without a hitch. It’s only if you keep your arms there that it drops out.

The leap at that time was physics engines. I believe they even mentioned that this approach was more or less at the center of the half life philosophy, to make a full length tech demo with a well developed story and polished engine. 

I think I stuck that in the back of my mind and forgot that I saw it in some random interview with very few views, because I've always thought of this as common knowledge. I've been saying since the Oculus was first announced in 2012 that the next HL game would be in VR. It just made sense that this was the next leap in technology that Valve was waiting for.

However I didn't think it would be this early in VR's lifetime. We still don't have widely accepted or agreed upon input methods or motion methods.

The first problem is it being an option.

Go and GearVR aside, there is essentially one set of controllers for the entire Oculus ecosystem. As a developer you can assume that all CV1/Quest/Rift S owners will have stuff like capacitive touch sensors, easy-to-click thumbsticks and the like.

If they release optional controllers, a relatively small percentage of people will buy them. This makes it hard to justify spending time on something that few people can use.

Also, developing these options has a heavy R&amp;D cost, and IMO working on 3rd-generation hardware is a better use of Oculus's engineers than making options maybe 10% of people will buy.",1574232327,f8463fs,t1_f83kmjg,/r/oculus/comments/dytvca/would_be_nice_to_have_a_knuckles_equivalent_for/f8463fs/,1,oculus,comment

5739,GregoryfromtheHood,t2_g0qor,"I've also done all the comfort mods I could find, velcro straps on the side, a top strap, plus the thick VR Cover foam just to get it comfortable and it's still nowhere near as comfortable as the Rift S.

As for the clarity and all that. There's no anti SDE filter so there are visible pixels there unlike the O+, but the Rift S feels more crisp, less blurred, even if there's a really faint SDE, and when I say there is an SDE, it's nothing like the CV1 or Quest pentile one, it's pretty subtle. I think most of the clarity also comes from the fact that the lenses are really, really good, definitely better than the O+, the entire FOV is clear and there's a huge sweet spot.

FOV is an interesting one, it's really usually subjective between people when they're this close, but it seems like it's basically on par and the Rift S lenses are really easy to jam up against your eyeballs to get more with the eye relief adjustment and the thin default foam.

Tracking and controllers are the really big thing. If the O+ had the same tracking and controllers it would be great because the headset itself is great visually, but the controllers and tracking on it just kills it and makes it feel more like a toy headset than a real one.

Overall the Rift S is a better headset, I guarantee you won't want to pick up your Odyssey again if you get one.",1574234480,f847t3n,t1_f846p5k,/r/oculus/comments/dywj0f/worth_it_to_upgrade_from_odyssey_to_rift_s/f847t3n/,1,oculus,comment

If I'd have to choose only one? Without hesitation: Quest. And not because of Link.

All in one system is something else. I'd say what Oculus have done with Quest is the only true next gen VR so far. Console like approach, easy of use and convenience are amazing. What little presence it looses due to 72hz, it gains it all back with being wireless. Quest was the only VR hmd that actually gave me true vertigo. With PC hmds wire always reminds me I'm in my room. Quest let me forget all about it and just be in the game/experience. It's liberating. I have more fun on Quest.

Oculus Link is just a cherry on top.

That being said, Rift S is much, much more comfortable. 80hz with LCD gives you more immediate presence and screen is sharper. Since Quest also requires a cable to play on PC (if you don't count VD streaming) it doesn't really have advantage over S here.

So it really depends what you are most interested in. PC VR or wireless mobile gaming with a chance to play some PC exclusives. If former, then get Rift S, if later then Quest.",1574236904,f849mua,t3_dyx4sf,/r/oculus/comments/dyx4sf/still_deciding/f849mua/,1,oculus,comment

The reason that flat-screen gaming is much more popular than VR is because of its accessibility. You need an area to play VR that most pc gamers just don't have. If VR was more accessible by the general population, your statement about bringing more franchises just isn't possible. I don't mean to offend, but to call the people who don't like this announcement ignorant, but you are just as ignorant about this being good for gaming as a whole. You make fun of these people for being close-minded but you ignore the fact that many of these people can't even get VR. The great thing about pc gaming is that there is no fixed price. however, this means that many things require much higher expenses for some people than others. I personly had to buy a new graphics card for VR. But for some people, a new system is required for VR as some have budget builds. This could result in upwards of $1000 dollars just to use VR. This obviously isn't ideal. Aswell people who suffer from bad motion sickness can't ever enjoy a comfortable VR experience. So saying that the only reason people are upset is because of lies is just false. And besides, you ignore the worst part about this announcement, if this game is bad, then AAA VR would die instantly and all the talk about VR being just a gimmick would all become true.

The adoption rate for technology/size of the market is not large enough to be a large concern.

5859,mechkg,t2_gwy83,"**Game developer**: *anything*

**Gamers**: Has game developer lost its mind? Given the evidence, it would seem so. At the very least, game developer has lost its ability to conduct an intellectual argument. Although my approach may appear a bit pedantic, by setting some generative point of view against a structural-taxonomical point of view or vice versa, I intend to argue that game developer lives in monologue rather than dialogue. I explained the reason for that just a moment ago. If you don't mind, though, I'll go ahead and explain it again. To begin with, with it so forcefully skewering me over a pit barbecue, things are starting to come to a head. That's why we must convey to people the knowledge that game developer holds onto power like the eunuch mandarins of the Forbidden City—sterile obstacles to progress who base racial definitions on lineage, phrenological characteristics, skin hue, and religion.

You may have heard game developer yap about how it is a refined organization with the soundest ethics and morals you can imagine. It's not uncommon to hear such admixtures of New Age babble and poststructuralism in game developer's jargon. To translate, we must show game developer that we are not powerless pedestrians on the asphalt of life. We must show it that we can defy it. Maybe then game developer will realize that its spittle-flecked rants are merely a stalking horse. They mask game developer's secret intention to condemn innocent people to death. I've heard even iracund dips apologize for their poor judgment. game developer never has. The significance of this is that society has been taking an increasingly lax attitude towards game developer's goading unsavory, volage-brained mattoids into hurling epithets at its opponents. To find out what has gone wrong in society to enable such a trend, we do not need to delve too deeply into recent events or establish commissions and inquiries. We know what has gone wrong. Specifically, game developer has committed a number of heinous acts against society. Its most piacular offense, however, is perhaps its promoting adventurism's traits as normative values to be embraced. As unconscionable as such behavior certainly is, game developer would not hesitate to bribe the parasitic with the earnings of the productive if it felt it could benefit from doing so.

Now, I don't mean for that to sound pessimistic, although if you've never seen game developer hurt the poorest and most vulnerable members of our society, you're either incredibly unobservant or are concealing the truth from yourself. If you think that game developer is the foremost truth-teller of our time then you're suffering from very serious nearsightedness. You're focusing too much on what game developer wants you to see and failing to observe many other things of much greater importance such as that it's a serial exaggerator. If I were to be less kind, I'd say game developer is a liar. Either way, whenever it claims that the majority of infelicific calumniators are heroes, if not saints, I can't help but think that it has just subtracted from the sum of human knowledge. An equal but opposite observation is that it once wrote a document whose sole purpose was to argue that the eradication of its traducers would restore mankind's golden age and save humanity from ruination. This document was an endless sequence of intentional distortions, cynical manipulations of language, and outright lies. It served no purpose other to get people thinking about how you may have noticed that even game developer's least refractory confidants supplement their already-generous incomes by selling contraband on the black market. But you don't know the half of it. For starters, it is time for people of honor and courage to advance freedom in countries strangled by tyranny. This issue is coming to the fore because game developer often misuses the word “crystallographically” to mean something vaguely related to narcissism or solecism or somesuch. game developer's yes-men, realizing that an exact definition is anathema to what they know in their hearts, are usually content to assume that game developer is merely trying to say that human rights can best be protected by suspending them altogether. In closing, I consider this letter to be required reading for everyone who still cares that no matter how much game developer squirms and wriggles, it will never escape the fact that one of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is libertinism. Unfortunately, with our nation's media being as controlled as it is, there's no way that this letter will be widely publicized. Therefore, I'm counting on you to pass on this letter to all of your e-mail contacts. Thank you.",1574248536,f84hawp,t3_dylq0z,/r/oculus/comments/dylq0z/current_mood_right_now_in_pc_gaming/f84hawp/,1,oculus,comment

And comfort for me is 100% the biggest seller of the S for me. Out of the box it's several times more comfortable than the quest. People can recommend counter weights, Vive deluxe straps and more mods but that's extra cost, plus you'll have to fork out for either the official link cable when it's out ($80) or look for 3rd party solutions which will likely be heavier than the rift s cable.

5966,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"You somewhat obliquely hit the nail on the head with this review. That's the thing common to most reviews. It's not X, it's not Y, it's not Z. All of them can easily point out what it \*could\* have been, but isn't. And none of them can easily point out what it \*IS\*.

Stormland isn't Division. In Division, AI is actually decent, you have PvE and PvP, you have a challenging 8-man raid, you have loot and builds out the ass. Finding a new gun in Division has meaning - it'll have 3 talents and stats that affect its performance.

Stormland isn't Far Cry, because that one had more weapons, suitable for variety of engagements. Which means Stormland is missing a bow, a silenced rifle, etc., etc. And bow came with multiple arrow types. etc. 

Stormland isn't Borderlands. If we could replay the game as Nyx, Riggs, etc., that would be similar to Borderlands. If each of those had three unique talent trees, then it would be Borderlands. If it had a 40 hr campaign, then it would be Borderlands. 

Each one of these other games had a POINT to it. In Division you need gear to get into progressively harder content, and difficulty gradient is palpable. Even with gear, only a tiny portion of population managed to beat the raid, because not only is it individually challenging, it requires clockwork teamwork from 8 people simultaneously. Borderlands got by on characters and the story, which Stormland sort of attempted but gave up on after 4 hrs. Exploration could have been a thing, but currently there's nothing to explore, it's exact same problem as Fallout 76 had, where you are figuring out what happened, chasing down leads, all the time knowing full well everyone is already dead, and there are no talking humans in the game. That's Stormland's problem - when you explore an island, climb to the top, and find a chest, unlike Division, Borderlands, Skyrim, etc., it's not exciting because you know what's in the box, it'll be one of the 6 guns in the  game. And it won't be a living, talking NPC you haven't seen, offering you an interesting quest. 

Problem is...Stormland isn't anything! I very reluctantly had to admit to myself that Stormland is just another tech demo. It's a MAGNIFICENT tech demo, mind you. Absolutely the best, tech demo of the year, easily. But still a tech demo. It lacks  basic things that would make it an actual, structured, cohesive game. Right now, outside the short tutorial, it's basically another sandbox to showcase the tech in, like Blade &amp; Sorcery. It's just a much bigger sandbox, and the tech being showed off is traversal instead of physics based combat. But that's about it.

Now, I'm not denying that it can be fun, for the right person. But that's not a very good metric, because some people are more easily entertained than others. There's people who can literally watch paint dry and think it's the best thing ever.",1574255087,f84n2a2,t3_dyy9pt,/r/oculus/comments/dyy9pt/just_finished_stormland/f84n2a2/,1,oculus,comment

5986,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"Thing is, in a normal game, stealth would have a point to it. And have strong mechanics associated with it. For example, in Deus Ex, stealth is best for a non-lethal playthrough, and the game has an achievement to beat the game without killing anyone - you knock them out, you tranq them, but you keep them alive. In Splinter Cell, it was a way to obtain information via interrogation that you otherwise wouldn't have. In Far Cry stealth clearing camps was just safer and in some ways quicker. In Hitman the pinnacle of achievement is to kill a target without anyone ever knowing it wasn't anything but an accident or death by natural causes, there would be no trace and no memory of you. In Metal Gear Solid it was just challenging, and many mission challenges require you to be undetected for a while so you don't spook whoever you're following. That's where stealth typically shines. You also usually have the ability to carry/drag/hide bodies, and AI isn't anemic. In all of these games, an all-out battle tended to be very risky and unpleasant. Even in fucking Skyrim stealth had benefits - you could listen to NPCs chat, often getting unique tidbits of story and lore, or a line on some valuables. There was a POINT to the stealth elements, in all these games.

And absolutely NONE of this exists in Stormland. Can you kill by sneaking up? Yah, but then what? Is there non-lethal playthrough like Deus Ex? Nope. Do you get intel you otherwise wouldn't have, like in Splinter Cell? Nope. Do you have dedicated stealth weapons like in Far Cry (bow, silenced gun, silenced sniper)? Nope. Is assassinating the target, as a ghost, where target just dies and none is the wiser a thing like in Hitman or Assassin's Creed? Nope. If the AI as good as MGS, or any of the above mentioned games? Nope. Does it have stealth mechanics such as carry/drag/hide bodies from patrols? Alert stages of patrols? Nope. Is the AI so deadly and dangerous that you feel it's safer to whittle down enemies from the perimeter first? Nope. But you can climb any wall, weeee! 

You say you go over and over the maps, to see if you missed anything. What exactly were you hoping to find? NPCs giving new and interesting quests? That's not in the game after the tutorial is done. Were you hoping for unique and interesting weapons, like Borderlands or Skyrim? That's not in the game either. Were you hoping for new gear? Nope, not in the game. Best you could have hoped for is yet another copy of the same 6 guns, each of which you've torn to shreds more times than you can count already, or some fruits to squeeze. That's hardly a good driving force to keep exploring.",1574256180,f84o8z0,t1_f84k2rk,/r/oculus/comments/dyy9pt/just_finished_stormland/f84o8z0/,1,oculus,comment

5993,OneMintyMoose,t2_xgws2,"Definitely get a Rift S, I had my doubts at first, but it really is a great headset.  I think that the jump from 90 to 72hz if you got a Quest would probably be much less jarring than from 90 to 80hz on the S.  Cable placement on Rift S is much better imo, coming out the back of your head rather than sticking out of the side of your head.  Comfort with the halo strap is night and day from CV1 and Quest, switching from CV1 to Quest is less comfortable as the Quest is much heavier than both CV1 and S.  

Tracking on Rift S is better than Quest, but CV1 really is the best if you have an open, dedicated area.  Tracking is generally good, but controllers near your face or behind your back can sometimes lose tracking.  Although, it is really great to only have a single usb port taken up for VR instead of 3 or 4, or 5.  Hand tracking is not currently announced for Rift S, but I think that it will show up eventually, considering they got it to run on a mobile CPU that's already processing VR.  Even if not, I think in this generation hand tracking will only be used essentially as a tech demo, using menus and specific apps, but it's not really practical for most of VR's applications.

Overall, you will be blown away by the Rift S, as soon as you put it on, you will notice the higher resolution and how the tracking just instantly works with no sensor errors or disconnecting USB sounds, the better lenses, the better comfort.  The only error I've run into I just unplug it and plug it back in and it works fine again.

Yes. Visual fidelity. And because Quest is doing the tracking onboard, some have already commented that controllers tracking 'can' feel sluggish.

But in your case, the Quest+Link will probably be great for you. You'll get a slight visual upgrade (still less than Rift S), you won't have the wires to deal with, and you'll get the standalone features.

6105,cd2220,t2_9w0yx,"You can be video gamey and still tell a good story though. I think a game can still be quite obviously a video game and still tell just as good of a story, and be taken just as seriously as a work of art. Half Life being a great example. I firmly believe having Gordon speak would totally change the tone and story of Half Life. Now I feel less immersed, I have to connect with this guy instead, his voice, his lines, his personality.

 I think it's unappreciative of the medium to imply it has to forgo its own strengths and qualities be more like a movie to advance, as if the things that make it a video game are bad. I can be immersed in a game without life like realism and cut scenes. Like when you fall into a trance while playing Tetris, for example.

Honestly I don't want to feel like I'm watching a movie and those games take me out of the experience because they always take control away from me. Cinema inherently does not allow for player control whereas videogames do, to imply that being more like them is the one true way is to say that video games can only improve and be looked at as real art by shedding what makes them, well, video games. Assassins Creed is one of my least favorite series for example because I always feel like control is taken away from me to make it more cinematic and movie like. It puts me to sleep. If I want something easy to play after work Ill just play a cinematic game because you don't have to think anyway. The ""game"" just does it all for you, like watching a movie.

This is not to say that its wrong to make games like that but you can still tell a great story and not be afraid to be video gamey as well. Neither is better than the other, they're just different. It annoys me when I here things like boss battles have no place in video games because they're too gamey. The latter part of that statement in and of itself makes zero sense to me. Now,in a game trying to be more cinematic? Sure, but to say video games as a whole should be that way? I don't get it. You can still tell great stories without trying to make me forget I'm playing a videogame.",1574135517,f80qgpg,t1_f7z0m11,/r/oculus/comments/dy1t8u/rumour_valve_is_about_to_announce_a_vr_game/f80qgpg/,1,oculus,comment

6116,Verona_dude,t2_wt8e5,Up until about 4 months ago Google did not tell people where the 3D areas were. For some unknown reason it was a closely held secret. It did not appear in any Google product.  An independent guy who formerly ran an unofficial Google Earth blog was the only guy that had this information.  Clearly it was leaked to him by someone inside of  Google. But about 4 months ago Google finally added a layer to show these spots in the Chrome version of Google Earth only. It is still not in Google Earth VR.  So the only way you can find these areas is to look them up first in Google Earth.  I've looked up literally hundreds of them that way. About 90 percent of more of the earth is NOT shot this way. So looking them up in Google Earth saves a lot of time.,1574136262,f80rg8n,t1_f805wnf,/r/oculus/comments/dy7c27/google_earth_has_dramatically_improved_3d_areas/f80rg8n/,1,oculus,comment

6198,MrFarePlay,t2_4gafwx00,"Rift S (like any PCVR) was meant for home gaming. It's very light and comfortable, gaming quality is determined mostly by your PC, and a long enough wire for the maximum space allowed.

Plus no battery needed so you don't have to keep an eye on the power or carry/attach a power bank with you the whole time.

But like any other PCVR, it wasn't meant to be portable, so sharing this with others, or just basically playing it in multiple rooms/places is a hassle because the PC/laptop has to come too.

If that's an issue for you then Quest is your headset. It's a 'bit' front heavy (comfort is relative) but overall an amazing headset that's completely standalone. No PC to lug around, no wires to jump scare you when playing horror games :P

Had issues getting audio to play through it (connected displayed red x instead of green the whole time) but using my gaming headset worked well enough.

Asgard's wrath actually loaded for the first time without crashing, home was silky smooth instead of the jerky mess I am used to, and borderlands vr was not only smoother but shots were more accurate.  On the other hand, VRchat was an unplayable mess compared to the rift (laggy as hell and constant jaggedy breakup in the image when moving) so it may depend on game.  Gonna try out echo arena tomorrow to see if maybe it was the whole online server aspect affecting things.  All this on an i3 and 1050ti so I am impressed.

6408,jmkj254,t2_1i35uq0a,"Thing is Valve doesn't care much for the reception. For the most part, they only release products that meet their high standard, particularly when it comes to IP they care about (Half Life, L4D, CS,TF). Great reception is a given and not a concern for them, kind of the way they released the Index at a premium, knowing that it was too expensive for most, but they were confident in the hardware enough to release it. Valves bottom line is and will continue to be the Steam Store. They do not need VR and the upcoming flagship titles to succeed to keep them afloat. They are doing it for the passion in many ways, and in others to add relevance to the Index HMD's existence. Even if it doesn't make people buy them out in droves, given these titles will be playable on other headsets as well. 

More importantly it will result in an incredibly large number of non steamVR headset users in installing steamVR, meaning they will now be part of the steam ecosystem. The Valve portfolio of products, software and API is more important than one game, the success or failure of one game doesn't do much to their bottom line. They are too invested in VR and as shown in the Valve News Network video titled ""Everything you need to know about Valve Index"". 

They have been working and committed to these 3 titles for an incredibly long time. They are inevitable. The only next moves to be defined are what next after each of them are out

6473,Frooxius,t2_5cj3j,"&gt; Unlikely, I tried it out with 3 or 4 friends and we were all in the same instance.

Still, like I said what you described sounds like the old calibration system, the new one has the quick calibration like I described.

You can delete humanoids the same way, grab a hand or hand and select ""Destroy"" from the menu as you would for object, scene editor is not necessary.

&gt; And that's precisely the issue. This ""VR-first"" approach doesn't quite work, nobody wants to spend 6 hours building scenes in a sweaty headset in 35 degrees celsius weather.    

That's simply untrue. Like I said people have built lots of different things inside of Neos and are building more every day, things you don't see on other platforms. We have companies and universities using it for building educational and training applications and benefiting from the VR-first approach.

If you don't like it yourself, that's fine, it's not for you, but we have a growing community of people who love it for that approach, spend time there every day and even support the development financially, so we're going to keep building it that way.

I'm not saying Unity and Unreal don't have advantages and aren't much more mature, but I believe there are merits to a new approach as well and I love exploring new area like that.

I agree that the UI's have a big learning curve, as they're largely functional and kinda overgrown by now. We have just started an UI overhaul, where everything will be redesigned to make the usage simple from the beginning and make the learning curve low. It's simply part of the development process, these things take time. I believe that will significantly improve the usability.
 
I'm not really sure why you'd think it lacks direction though? Every decision and development has been strongly influenced by the goals and vision behind Neos. We're taking a slow, sustainable approach to ensure that everything is built on a solid core.",1574160410,f81bmfq,t1_f81axuw,/r/oculus/comments/duhau0/10_point_full_body_tracking_in_action_head_hands/f81bmfq/,1,oculus,comment

6480,Lujho,t2_3670xqbx,"A half decent 1080p TV is going to look better than either of those headsets any day, I’m afraid (except maybe for the great contrast on the Quest). The resolution in the headsets just isn’t there yet. Depending on the size of your virtual screen, you’ll get between SD and 720p resolution. And 720p is probably being generous. 

It’ll do in a pinch if you have no other way to watch something, and it’s a fun novelty to watch a movie in a virtual cinema for a while. But if you’re really looking for a true Tv replacement and don’t care about games and such, then in my honest opinion you’re better off with a TV. 

Oh, and there are definitely noticeable god rays and light rings from the fresnel lenses on the Quest. They are less noticeable on the Go, but that’s due to the less contrasts screen.

It does not help that most of the “Rift S is dead” hyperbole was from media that appear technically clueless and some on Reddit echoed them.  That said, a PC version of the same game on Quest will still look far better- even with the compression.

**Transference**. Scary, if that's okay with you. Great story, incredible audio-visual design and immersion.

**The Solus Project**. Adventure sci-fi. Starts slow and feels like it will be kinda 'eh', but stick with it and once it digs its claws in, it becomes an amazing game with a fantastic sci-fi story.

**Arca's Path**. Unique game, subtle and simple but impeccably designed. A great short story told entirely through visuals.

**Pixel Ripped 1989**. So creative and unique and fun, a light story but it is full of character and world immersion.

**HOST**. Very short game (I think about 15 minutes?), but so unique and immersive and great environmental design. Sci-fi adventure, not really a 'story' but an immersive space/world that carries a subtle progression of discovery. Requires a large play space, as you don't move with controllers, you move by moving, for the entire game. It is designed specifically so that you will be walking around your playspace in a certain way, so you need the required space.",1574060071,f7xjgnp,t3_dxsyxu,/r/oculus/comments/dxsyxu/best_narrative_games/f7xjgnp/,1,oculus,comment

Which looks amazing, and it is reasonable immersive controlling it from above (and seeing your opponent, which you can wonder if it is good for multiplayer). But to be fair: Its gameplay is quite shallow compared to pancake RTS, and I wonder if with VR controllers that will be different anytime soon. I think that is the same as with console RTS: Sure they exist, but overall it is largely a mouse + keyboard genre. Also the immersion is more limited when you look down on it the entire game versus a first person game (or even something like Moss, where you are more in it).",1574060199,f7xjkf9,t3_dxz6g0,/r/oculus/comments/dxz6g0/where_are_all_the_rts_games/f7xjkf9/,1,oculus,comment

Year later I used first Vive. The wands made so much difference, I haven't felt sick at all.

The gameplay videos all made it look really fun, and the reviews for these games are generally really good. From what I’ve read, Final Assault gives you the opportunity to zoom right in to the action in an incredible amount of detail, which sounds amazing as well.

Still, I take your point, some things are just better on a specific platform. Still, I’m surprised that only 3 attempts have been made?

Kind of makes sense/seems fitting that their 3rd and final flagship VR title of the bunch be HL3VR",1574077638,f7xvqy2,t1_f7xuki0,/r/oculus/comments/dy1t8u/rumour_valve_is_about_to_announce_a_vr_game/f7xvqy2/,1,oculus,comment

Something I've also saw with regards to the ""Left Side Slack"" method I described above. People have suggested an alternate method of using a [zip tie instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/8o1h6g/anyone_get_a_kink_in_their_cable_right_at_the/e00gt6z/). I've never done that one but I have also seen recent posts that people who used the zip tie method ended up stripping the outside of the cable sheath over time. I just did a search for those posts but couldn't find anything so don't quote me. I'd prefer tape or a softish sleeve like you described.

I would recommend the 1070 over the 980ti if possible.  I had a used 980ti for $200 about a year ago and it crapped out on me after a few months.  The 1070 even used will be a good bit newer and you might even find one with a  warranty still (EVGA honors warranty for 3 years even if you bought used, you do need to register on their website with a receipt showing you purchased it from previous owner, paypal receipt works fine if you buy on Ebay).  My 1070ti still has almost 2 years of warranty left, so that's a good question to ask a seller, when did they originally purchase?  If you can get a year or more of warranty it makes a used purchase feel a lot safer and you can get more for your money.

Also the 10 series has VR optimizations that would outperform the 980ti even if all other things were equal.  I am still running a 1070ti on one of my machines and it performs admirably even in Asgard's Wrath/Stormland.

6811,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"Typically you can find market reports. Last year, for example, projected sales were 3.3 bil, instead they got 3.6 bil, with Sony selling a record number of VR units. And this year, with Rift S and Quest, both with inside-out tracking that made it very attractive for filthy casuals, I expect another significant uptick, seeing as Oculus claims they're selling VR headsets as fast as they can make them, and it doesn't appear Quest will even go on sale on Black Friday. That suggests it's selling very well. 

To me, VR really reminds me of what we went through when computer mice first appeared. I think most people here probably won't remember, but it's a lot of the same arguments. What, I need space on my desktop for a mouse and a mousepad, which I have to buy?! I can already move the cursor on my screen with a keyboard! What a stupid gimmick! What, the mouse has a cord, and cord gets in the way so much. I have to open up my mouse and clean the lint from it so the ball can spin? I don't want to exercise my whole arm, which is what I have to do to push the mouse around! Etc., etc. All exact same complaints as with VR right now. But, eventually, people saw the light. Especially when Windows and such started to come out and it became painfully obvious how great mouse was for that. It'll very likely be the same in VR.

But with a caveat - one of the big things about VR is the necessity for the player to get off their fat ass and actually MOVE. Especially in gaming, but even in productivity software - you're making big arm movements. In the first world, a significant percentage of the population is now not just overweight, but utterly obese. In USA, something like 40% are obese, and 30% overweight. So to try and get these people, voluntarily, on their feet, and moving their torso, when they can get by just flicking one wrist around in motions measuring in inches might be an insurpassable obstacle. So we have a Wall-E situation going, where they're just reclining in chairs, and watching stuff on screen (can be in VR, of course, but still), and it leaves at least one hand free for eating and drinking. Bottom line, this might be the biggest obstacle to VR making it into mainstream, which other peripherals didn't have to deal with.",1574083913,f7y1sde,t3_dy2ugp,/r/oculus/comments/dy2ugp/is_there_a_way_to_measure_if_vr_is_dying_or_not/f7y1sde/,1,oculus,comment

6829,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"That was such a weird move for them to make, tying difficulty to real time. I won't say it was dumb,  but maybe it was dumb? Let's be honest - for a lot of people zero difficulty was just trivial, especially in co-op. The AI isn't strong enough to pose a significant challenge, and it doesn't have even a fraction of the tools the player has for traversal. And being locked into that for an entire calendar week is just silly. So it takes you two calendar weeks to push the difficulty up to max, but what if you realize that level 2 is a bit much for you? Now you have to wait TWO full calendar weeks for the difficulty to drop before you can play again enjoyable. That, to me, is utterly insane design choice. There's a reason overwhelming majority of games has a difficulty selection in the goddamn settings menu.",1574085033,f7y32h8,t1_f7xm571,/r/oculus/comments/dxzo6z/stormland_escalation_levels/f7y32h8/,1,oculus,comment

6851,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"Yep, it's really special. My only wish is that combat was a bit better, too much clipping where if your weapon isn't moving fast enough, or the enemy is too close. It's really good, but still falls behind some of the other games (Until You Fall, etc), and that's real shame. Similarly, controls are often awkward, dodge being a stick + button makes it too slow on highest difficulty to use reliably. Which is again something like UYF did better - stick alone, forward and back, on the RIGHT stick, is dash forward and dash  back.

Which is a fair argument because... well that's the point of the Quest IMO, quick VR from anywhere.

Where the CV1 will typically end up with longer sessions.

&amp;#x200B;

Things may change when Link comes around and I put actual hours at a time in the Quest, but personally I don't mind the weight.

&amp;#x200B;

What I did however mind was the CV1's back head ring / triangle shape digging into my head which began to \[severely\] hurt within an hour, and I'd just deal with it. And the Quest doesn't have that... so I'd say, if you find the CV1 uncomfortable only in the sense of how it grabs the rear of your head, you may be in the same boat.

     Thermoelectric coolers operate according to the Peltier effect. The effect creates a temperature difference by transferring heat between two electrical junctions. A voltage is applied across joined conductors to create an electric current. When the current flows through the junctions of the two conductors, heat is removed at one junction and cooling occurs. Heat is deposited at the other junction.

In my truely honest opinion the cv1 was a nice bit of qaulity kit , the sound quality is fantastic the picture quality although not as high res as the s is by far way better than the s and tracking is rock solid and no stupid bulging head band stabbing you in the back of your head if you lay back in your chair chilling out.

6974,ID_Guy,t2_xmpxi,"It truly is an amazing game for sure.  In my opinion its one of the best games developed for VR from the ground up.  Every person who owns a vr headset should at least give it a shot and see if they like it.  Im on the third hero so hope to get finished with it in the next week so I can give stormland a try.

The intersting thing to me is the lack of hype from the general gaming news media.  I mean this is next level gaming, but it just gets a short review on a few of the sites and everyone moves on.  

I feel like VR is really struggling to get attention in this age of over information and short attention spans.  If this came out when I was a kid growing up in the 80's it would be seen as witchcraft technology and be all over the major news networks. People would be loosing their minds and kids would be begging their parents for a VR headset. 

Is it that people want an existing IP they can relate to for VR to really take off?  People are more comfortable trying something new when its somewhat familiar I guess.  Or its just that its harder for people to try out vs a console?  Im  at a loss for the general public response to VR in general and groundbreaking games like this.",1574092144,f7ycmhq,t3_dxxth7,/r/oculus/comments/dxxth7/asgards_wrath_holy_crap/f7ycmhq/,1,oculus,comment

7057,asdfffffdsa,t2_v96t2,"One possibility is that you are just very sensitive to distortion.  As I understand it, this cannot be entirely eliminated without eyetracking.  I've noticed it in every headset I've tried and could see it very easily in the Rift CV1 (but it was tolerable).  I've spent many hours modding facial interfaces and messing with adjustments but I could never eliminate it.  It's especially noticeable when looking at distant scenery or a detailed wall texture.  A properly dialed in Index has minimized it for me the most (of course it's not 100% eliminated) so if you know someone that has one you may want to try it and spend a good amount of time finding the optimal adjusment (e.g. if your eyes are deep set, use the lens depth adjustment to get the lenses as close to your eyes as possible).  
&amp;nbsp;  
There seems to be a wide range of sensitivities to this problem.  Some headsets e.g. the Samsung Odyssey and a Vive+GearVR lenses (modded in) apparently look fine for some people but to me they are like looking through fishbowls (normal Vive with an adjusted facial interface isn't so bad).  A scary thing is that (at least according to alan yates) distortion like this can even cause discomfort on a subconscious level.  That is, even if one is not able to notice the distortion it can still discomfort them.",1573964094,f7qhqug,t1_f7omrn4,/r/oculus/comments/dx9rqu/i_really_tried_to_love_vr_but_the_nausea_just/f7qhqug/,1,oculus,comment

Since you're coming from a Go, I would guess that mobile VR matters to you a bit, so you might get some good mileage out of the Quest by itself too.

7260,a_gilling,t2_9ubp99,"Summary for those who dont want to watch the video:

2019 has been a big year for VR and the Video goes in to detail why I think it will be looked back on as a Landmark Year for Virtual Reality.

The video is split into 2 parts, Hardware and Software.

**Hardware** \- I go into a little detail about the past and why I think VR didnt take off as much as industry insiders expected. I then talk about the new headsets we have had launch this year

Oculus launched the Rift S and Quest in May, Valve launched the Index in June and HTC launched something called the cosmos no one gives a shit about.

We now have 3 new headsets that cater to different audiences and give more options with the quest an affordable option for people without a pS4 or Gaming PC, Rift S is priced well and easy to setup with inside out tracking and the Index for those with deeper pockets who want less compromises.

You also still have the PSVR which is the cheapest and most affordable of all of them if you have a PS4 already with them dropping to $200-250 on a regular basis.

Its now never been easier for someone to get in to VR gaming, the Quest is selling well and overall we have turned a corner in terms of accessability and ease of use while having a significant step forward in visual clarity and comfort.

**Software** \- Back in the beginning of Consumer VR the games were very basic with lots of short indie wave shooters and things that felt more like tech demos rather than the Fully Fleshed out VR games we want. Developers were playing it safe with lots of games using Teleportation movement, especially the exclusive stuff from Oculus and Sony.

Big AAA games take along time to develop with large teams of people working full time on them and cost alot of money. Only now after 3 years of Consumer VR are we starting to see the big games we have dreamt of like Asgards Wrath, Blood and Truth and Stormland with Iron Man VR, Medal of Honor and Lone Echo 2 on the Horizon. 

They are all exclusives but we are also seeing smaller indie developers really start to get to grip with VR game development with some of the earlier studios bringing out some next level games terms of scope and world interactions, Games like Boneworks, Walking Dead Saints and Sinners, Espire:1 etc and we have lots more games in the works that we know of and alot that will be announced next year.

Overall I think this has been a massive year for VR gaming with some big steps forward for both hardware and software, we also have the PS5 confirmed next year which will support the current PSVR plus loads more excellent games that feel like a generation forward.

Do people agree with me or am I just talking out of my Poo Pipe?",1573989587,f7s0p6g,t3_dxledd,/r/oculus/comments/dxledd/2019_a_landmark_year_for_virtual_reality_summary/f7s0p6g/,1,oculus,comment

7284,mushaaleste2,t2_z6x4q,"Rift s!  For the CV1 you need 3 sensors to get the same ability in term of roomscale. The sensors are a little pain in the a... in terms of installing them (on the room ceiling), you also need extension usb cables. Maybe you also need some extension for the two cv1 cables (usb/hdmi). All the stuff prop. needs an usb 3.0 extension card as the famous inatek cards. All that is not needed for the rift s - its an far more ""plug and play"" feeling. 

Then there is the resolution bumb which is higher due to the subpixel amount of the lcd screen. This comes without any perfomance probs cause of the 80 hz screen refresh - so the resolution upgrade is more or less free in terms of processing power needed. 

Bad thing on the rift s are the speakers - but there are easy solutions (headphones) or just use the mantis ones for psvr which fits also on the rift s (i have them, they are good).",1573992271,f7s8umv,t3_dxl9yc,/r/oculus/comments/dxl9yc/cv1_or_s/f7s8umv/,1,oculus,comment

7290,tmvr,t2_11qlhv,"It's not a simple question, you have to weigh you options.

1) is $150 a lot of money for you?

2) what is your IDP? this is very important because if you are way outside of the range for the Rift S the question answered itself

3) you have to consider the possibility of having the two most well known issues with the CV1 - breaking of the headphone cable and the lack of proprietary HDMI cable on stock if yours breaks. The latter is being dealt with by Oculus and there will probably be some in stock in the future, but for you it most probably means additional hassle and costs. For the headphone issue there are some DYI solutions out there

Realistically, if your IPD is fine for the Rift S than I'd probably go with that one. It's your decision though, if you think having a used product with the potential of having to deal with the issues listed above is worth the $150 saving than o for the CV1.",1573992776,f7sajzd,t3_dxl9yc,/r/oculus/comments/dxl9yc/cv1_or_s/f7sajzd/,1,oculus,comment

[https://apps.autodesk.com/MAYA/en/Detail/Index?id=265209227563613977&amp;appLang=en&amp;os=Win64](https://apps.autodesk.com/MAYA/en/Detail/Index?id=265209227563613977&amp;appLang=en&amp;os=Win64)

If you'll do a lot of sitting at a computer to work, you may want to do that as comfortably as possible. For me, that's with the RIft S. You might research Oculus Quest comfort to read about that. That may influence your buying decision.

I never considered ""going through Android"" to be a Quest issue. I would wait until the Link comes out to make sure that everything you need to do will happen on the Quest Link. It should, but we haven't proven that.

There's no way I could sit for a long time and work with a Quest on when there's a more comfortable Rift S next to me. But as you note, you'll miss out on a lot of the Quest's benefits if you don't get one.

You may discover other non-gaming experiences that you might like -- experiences you could explore anywhere thanks to the Quest's mobility.  You might even find Steam VR apps that you could view successfully in the Quest via WiFi streaming. So imagine sitting in another room or in a chair far away from your computer and being able to view and work with those types of apps -- free from the confines a cable will impose.

I think it's such a hard decision for buyers because the Quest has so many useful features. But consider comfort if your primary goal is to sit in front of a computer for an extended amount of time.",1574001237,f7t5tdx,t3_dxmarl,/r/oculus/comments/dxmarl/quest_or_rift_s_for_developing_gamesapps/f7t5tdx/,1,oculus,comment

7410,Unacceptable_Lemons,t2_h34m8,"Nah.  It just looks like it's about 1 ""full generation"" behind, with DK2 being the prototype of the current ""full generation"".  It's a PS1 to PS2 jump.  I think we've still yet to see a PS3 jump to the 3rd full gen.  Index is pushing it, but that still feels like PS4 Pro vs PS4 situation.  Like a VR Gen 2 Pro model, while Pimax is... I dunno?  Some kind of weird Pro model as well?  Atari 2600 is so many full generations behind now, I'd say we'll be waiting another 5 years at least before the DK1 looks as dated.  Maybe more, with what currently feels like a slow burn of PC VR improvements.

IMHO, when we get foveated rendering unlocking the ability to push screens of at least several times higher res than we use now, with simultaneously notably wider FOVs (at least Index-wide), and maybe one other full new feature (hopefully varifocal lenses) then that will be a new Full Generation in my view.  After that, it'll be in maintaining (at least most of) those gains, but adding wireless, by building off the efficiency of foveated rendering.  Tethered option to available for both charging battery, and maximum data bandwidth.

After that?  Haptics, maybe?  I'd say we'll be in the iterative stage for a while though.  Steady evolution in the then-existing features, not revolution, at least for a while.  Maybe some fun developments with controllers and skeletal tracking. (though hand tracking should be here to stay already, and get better over time).",1574004812,f7tj3y5,t3_dxdv4o,/r/oculus/comments/dxdv4o/reduce_that_to_5_years/f7tj3y5/,1,oculus,comment

7554,SemiActiveBotHoming,t2_13y9whqw,"First, I should note that I do not have any first-hand experience with this like I do with AWS - if you have, please correct me if I'm wrong about something.

It looks like Unity is pointing people towards Multiplay. On [their website](https://multiplay.com/services/) it looks like (for their cloud options where scaling is effective) they manage stuff on AWS and GCP, which come under their standard instance limits.

The thing is that no reasonably-priced cloud provider wants to deal with extremely elastic loads - if your physical servers are full during the day and only used at 20% capacity overnight you're wasting a lot of money.

Providers have various ways of mitigating this - for example, AWS EC2 has (IIRC) Reserved Instances where you pay half price when there is little server load, but your instances get shut down as soon as they need that capacity.

If they let you scale up to a huge number of servers for a few hours, and everyone was doing that, they'd have a huge amount of off-peak servers to either sell at half price or (in the extreme case if all the reserved instances are running) leave idle.",1573876582,f7mx9a8,t1_f7mb0cj,/r/oculus/comments/dwd1j9/psa_if_you_gave_stormland_a_1_star_review_because/f7mx9a8/,1,oculus,comment

7627,JorgTheElder,t2_fcqx9,"Here is my opinion as posted elsewhere. Apologies to those who have seen it multiple times, but this topic gets posted several times a day. *We really need a sticky thread for it.*

*Oculus Link* turns the *Quest* into a *streaming PCVR* device, not a *native PCVR* device.

That means that the *Quest* is not *quite* as good for *PCVR* as the *Rift S* for multiple reasons:

* lower framerate - 72Hz
* smaller render target *(lower resolution video, said to even be lower than on CV1 but I cannot find an official source for this.)*
* mandatory *fixed foveated rendering* *(Really [ADDT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gocUADwqo8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=671), but I consider it a form of FFR because it prioritizes the center of the image, a pseudo fovea, over the edges of the image.)*
* capped 150Mbs video stream *(this may change but it will never match DisplayPort)*
* latency issues causing video artifacts, [*Sean Liu* from Oculus](https://youtu.be/K2zLneGGbk8?t=968)
* heavier
* one less tracking camera
* straps instead of halo *(subjective but makes a difference for long play sessions)*
* pentile  OLED *(subjective, but a lot of people think the Rifts S LCD is better for games)*

None of those are huge, but they add up especially, if you are looking for a PCVR focused device.

Don't take my word on it [here is what Carmack has to say about it](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1178332857909043201?s=20), and  [his comments about Beat Saber over Oculus Link](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1178721529741352960?s=20).

**Note:** If you have an IPD that is not supported by the *Rift S*, the physical IPD adjustment of the *Quest* can easily outweigh all of the items above, but if you don't need the physical IPD adjustment, I find it hard to believe that the *Quest* is the right choice for someone who is focused on *PCVR*.",1573888036,f7n7ofl,t3_dwwohb,/r/oculus/comments/dwwohb/can_the_oculus_quest_with_the_link_really_replace/f7n7ofl/,1,oculus,comment

7640,TheLavalampe,t2_m4gwg,"A 1080 ti is significantly faster than a 1080. The ti adds a lot in this case. I imagine that this really helps considering that asw kicks in as soon as you have no headroom left to stay above 90/80 fps on rift/rifts. 

So if OP gets close to 89 fps asw locks you at 45 fps and it does so really seamlessly. in this case you would still should have atleast 10 to 20 fps if not more headroom on a 1080 ti since its roughly 25% more powerful.

And asw  is really noticable in stormlands not so much for the visuals but the hand tracking gets really jittery.

My suggestion would be to turn off asw for stormlands to see if that fixes it , in addition to updating drivers ofc",1573889319,f7n8kch,t1_f7n2dce,/r/oculus/comments/dx0mlh/stromland_performnace/f7n8kch/,1,oculus,comment

7697,thegarbz,t2_4mkn3ul,"&gt; It's not worthless. If the company sees it then it's invaluable feedback.

Hahahah. Review bombing devalues reviews, as a result customers stop caring, and companies stop caring. The game is selling well. The game got many pre-orders. Insomniac likely won't even bother getting the reviews or if they do they'll pay a marketing firm to aggregate them and they will brush it off as the noise unrelated to the game that it is. 

&gt; I'm pretty aware that games as a service require solid servers and if those are failing on day one then that means the game is less likely to be a strong service.

You'd be quite wrong. There's absolutely no correlation between temporary launch day issues and ongoing service problems. There's a strong correlation for game related bugs and half baked releases correlating to poor service, but ultimately that's not at all what is happening here. 

&gt; Nobody forced insomniac to create an always online experience.
Indeed. Everyone should shout from the roof that Insomniac is useless and screwed up a launch. Review the service. But giving bad reviews for the games doesn't help me, you, or anyone understand what they can expect. i.e. the review is now worthless.",1573897723,f7ndukr,t1_f7mjqeo,/r/oculus/comments/dwckq8/it_sometimes_saddens_me_to_a_be_a_part_of_the_vr/f7ndukr/,1,oculus,comment

I'd hazard a guess that, amidst all of the dumb stuff that happened at launch, myself and maybe you as well, failed to get our keys properly registered, so our games appear to be fraudulent. I didn't do the log search until after 5pm, so it'll be a few more hours until morning when somebody looks over my results and gives me some useful feedback. But I bet they have to do something internally. Oculus will likely have to re-register the game to me and my account.

7734,SpiritOfFire90,t2_9z2kkrg,For what the Rift S is intended for (a dedicated PCVR HMD) it is still better than the Quest for its intended use case at the same price point. Its specs are better than the quest for PCVR gaming. If a customer wants the superior PCVR headset and doesn't care about the mobility factor the Rift S comes out ahead. Rift S vs Index argument doesn't make sense either. The Rift S is a cheaper option because it's technically inferior. It's not a better headset because it's cheaper and the Index isn't an obsolete HMD because it's more expensive. It's like saying desktop PCs are obsolete because laptops are mobile and can run eGPUs. Just because the laptop can hook up a GPU in an enclosure doesn't make it as powerful as a desktop PC with an equivalent dedicated GPU. The Quest will not provide an equivalent PCVR experience to what the Rift S can. Both headsets will have their own share of the market.,1573903161,f7nh2k1,t1_f7n9wsi,/r/oculus/comments/dvniw9/the_fate_of_the_rift_s/f7nh2k1/,1,oculus,comment

However one thing to note is that the 2060 Super is better than the 2060 by a decent amount. A 2060 Super is really close to a 2070 and i believe it's worth the price difference which isn't too steep.

There is also the rx 5700 xt from amd which in my opinion has a great price for it's performance and beats the 2060 super in performance.

So the 2060 will be perfectly fine but i would pay a little more for either the 2060 super or rx 5700 xt.

It's -maybe- a culture thing. There are 3-4 big languages spoken across the world. If you begin the game with locatization in mind, willing to give subs or dubbed voices, then, eventually, you could end up adding all of them. If you start the developing process without any intention to locale the game, then you have done clearly a statement (for whatever reason you could have).

All hype died. I am hesitant to call it a tech demo, because it's such a loaded statement in context of VR, but to me it IS bordering on a tech demo. It's not, but it's borderline. They took a few steps beyond it, so that it isn't a tech demo, but if they turn around they can still easily piss back over the line. It's a pissing-range tech demo.

Combat is really bland, and doesn't feel particularly good. Enemy variety is lacking. No boss battles that I know of. The campaign is a few hours long, and is more of a tutorial than an actual campaign, you spend a few hours just running around unlocking things like the ability to look at your map or the ability to sprint and jump and climb. And after that it's grind baby grind. Except there's no reason to grind - there's no unique loot, no unique cosmetics, no unique upgrades, no interesting boss fights. It's just an endless, pointless loop.

Go with Asgard. There's different characters, a dozen unique pets, each with a unique ability, there's a story, there's many boss fights and arena challenges, etc., etc.

Also, the built in headphones have a common issue of dieing from the head strap being tugged on when putting on/taking off he head mounted display (hmd).

The room calibration on the cv1 can take time. I would struggle, sometimes for 15 minutes trying to get everything set up.

The S is easier to use, the image is drastically more clear than the cv1. Setup is super easy, plus, with passthrough, you don't need to remove it to see around you. Also uses three fewer USB ports. Imo, it is far better than the cv1 and with your situation, would be the better choice. The bad of the S is that the external speakers are the equivalent of a cellphone speaker. However, the S has a headphone plug on the unit, so you can wear headphones and not worry about dragging that extra cable around.",1573911260,f7nnjth,t3_dx6qyk,/r/oculus/comments/dx6qyk/noob_cv1_setup_questions/f7nnjth/,1,oculus,comment

Crunch Element is a physics-centered VR infiltration game where the player can siege compounds in whatever play style suits them. Whether that’s scaling walls quietly with a suppressed pistol taking the roof entrance, or using a breaching charge as a hole-puncher-for-walls with a sawed-off on the hip, Crunch Element’s goal is to give the player as much freedom as possible and allow them to express themselves through whatever play style suits them. Many of these play styles are complemented by the flagship mechanic of destructible walls, doors, and floors. My goal is to include the community in the development process as much as possible by allowing early hands-on testing and considering player feedback at every step of the way.

7869,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"The format of your play sessions matters here. You say you don't play often, does that mean you have long sittings (2-3 hrs at a stretch) but once or twice a week, or many short sessions, of 30 mins or less?

The reason I ask is that in Stormland, when you fire it up, you load in at the base. And it can take you literally 10 mins just traveling to get back to what you were doing before you logged off. The game has zero respect for player time, and is passed to all hell with needless travel. Imagine a fragmentation grenade. You hold it in your hand, and it's small, and you can quickly and easily touch every piece of it. Now imagine it explodes in a room. How easy is it to touch each piece now? How long does it take? Much longer now, because some pieces are embedded in the floor, others in the ceiling, it'll take you hours to find and touch every piece. That's world design on Stormland, an exploded grenade. Doesn't make it any bigger, it's still a fist-sized object, it's just been exploded over ""clouds"", which is basically amorphous white nothing, that you  have to travel through, wasting time. 

So, based on world design alone, I already wouldn't recommend Stormland to a casual player, the game has too many needless time sinks between short bursts of actual content. And actual content is repetitive in Ubisoft fashion. Have you played Far Cry, with copy-pasted bases sprinkled all over? Or Assassin's Creeds, with gang hideouts, forts, etc, that you capture, over and over, for no apparent reason? That's basically Stormland in its entirety. 

As far as the story, there is almost none. It's a glorified tutorial. It'll take you 2 hrs of running around just to unlock the ability to climb, open your map, sprint, etc. You'll get some glimpses of other robots, but not much. And very little character building or story. If you're expecting something of any depth, sci-fi style, on the same level as Mass Effect or even Anthem, this game doesn't get there. And after this 4-5 hr tutorial, that's pretty much it. It's just grind baby grind. 

Now, is Stormland a bad game? No. It has its strengths, and for the right player, with the right mindset, it totally works. For me, Stormland is basically No Man's Sky, if you strip out survival elements, inventory management, trading, industry, spaceships, space combat, wormholes, freighters, base building, submarines and underwater content, animal husbandry and multiplayer communal hub and events. But in exchange you get better traversal, better combat, and more weapons. It's basically No Man's Sky but you're trapped on one planet, with no way out, and all you do is kill.

And then there's Asgard's Wrath, with \~15-20 hrs of actual story. Yes, it's fairly simple and campy, but at least it's there. It too has a lengthy beginning where first hour is just a tutorial, but beyond that it opens up. You get multiple heroes, multiple pets (about a dozen, with unique abilities), decent combat (you have to dodge red attacks, and parry blue attacks, that kind of thing). It has actual honest-to-god boss fights that feel interesting. It has tons of puzzles, though not particularly complex. It has arenas to fight NPCs in for fame and glory, and dungeons to crawl through for loot. It's a full fledged game.

For me personally, Asgard just feels better. It allows multiple saves, Stormland does not. It respects my time by not padding the  game with forced travel, Stormland does not. It allows me to adjust difficulty at the beginning or at any time, Stormland does not (you have to grind your way through copy-pasted content, TWICE, to set the game to highest difficulty, and then if you don't keep on doing it, difficulty will drop, by itself, after 2 weeks, and you have to do it again). It's about respect to the player. Asgard affords you every courtesy, Stormland assumes you're a brainless peasant who can't hit the broad side of a barn with a howitzer from 5 feet away.

But having said all that, Stormland has...something. Which is why I haven't refunded it. It's probably the closest I came in feeling like playing a druid in WoW, where you'd be sprinting across the hills in cheetah form, jump off a cliff, turn into a bird and glide, then turn into a bear and bear-drop on an unsuspecting mob, kill it, jump into a lake, turn into a seal and swim away. That sensation of absolute freedom is hard to come by. And that's what Stormland has in spades. 

It's also the kind of game where you don't need your brain to be on at all times. In Asgard, you need to pay attention, unless playing on Easy. You have to be aware when to dodge, when to block, when to parry. Stormland doesn't require you to plan your approach too much. As long as you don't stand in the open, in the middle of the base, and open fire, you'll be find. Most semi-sensible approaches will work. Which, after a hard day, can be beneficial. If you feel mentally spent and just feel like shooting some robots in the face with pump-action shotgun while screaming ""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!"", this game works fairly well.

Bottom line, if I had to have one game, to play for the rest of my life, and it was between Asgard and Stormland, it would be Asgard without even a tiny hesitation. It's a full game, full of content. But Stormland has its own charm - it's a sandboxy world to run around in, it's very accessible, the mechanics are very simple. You just hop in, kill some things, hop out. But there's really no driving force behind it - you don't get any special loot, unique weapons, etc., it's just killing for killing sake, on a timer.",1573915447,f7nuiv6,t3_dx79f1,/r/oculus/comments/dx79f1/stormland_or_asgards_wrath/f7nuiv6/,1,oculus,comment

7893,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"Yeah, I rag on Stormland a lot, it's really disappointing compared to what it could/should have been had they put in more thought and effort. But at the same time, it's not a game I would suggest anyone skip outright. Maybe don't get it now, but a bit later, especially if it goes on sale. It's like if you had to pick between Gorn and Until You Fall. Both are good, solid games. Both have strengths and weaknesses. But Until You Fall just has so much more depth, complexity and polish that given a choice between just those two, the choice is obvious. But I still had many hours of fun in Gorn, and don't feel like they were wasted. 

And yeah, I'd be surprised if AW went on sale any time soon. BUT, Black Friday/Cyber Monday is literally 2 weeks away. If it does go on sale, it'll be then. If it doesn't, it'll be safe to assume it'll be a solid 6 months at least until it does.

The only catch is that you can't uninstall, apparently, before you try to refund. At least that's what I heard. 

I didn't mind the mobility at all, but there has to be A POINT to all of this, and there isn't one. Like, in early Assassin's Creeds (which themselves were spawned by Prince of Persia reboot, also by Ubisoft, which began a decade earlier by the original Prince of Persia 1 &amp; 2 by Broderbund Software), if you botched a climb, you fell to your death. The climb wasn't a given, it was a bit of a challenge, and a bit of a puzzle, sometimes you had to climb down and sideways to find more handholds to continue to go up. All of this is lacking in Stormland, you can't die from traversal no matter how hard you try. Which makes the whole thing trivial. There aren't enemies that require you to traverse. It's helpful, but not mandatory. And since the game lacks any kind of special loot, there's little point to go exploring. 

What I mean is, when I find a chest in Borderlands, I'm EXCITED! There could be anything in there. When I'm exploring in Skyrim, I know there's always a chance I'll find a named item there, or even a daedric artifact (named unique). But when I find a chest at the top of the building in Stormland, it's like...who gives a shit? I open it, there's an SMG and a shotgun. And? Is that it? Fine, I rip them apart for mats/ammo, and move on. If I'm good on both, I wouldn't even bother opening the chest. That is such a monumental flaw in an allegedly exploration game it gives me a headache just thinking about it.",1573918591,f7o0fct,t1_f7nxpom,/r/oculus/comments/dx79f1/stormland_or_asgards_wrath/f7o0fct/,1,oculus,comment

7934,TheYeesaurus,t2_3tfbs7za,"I will get my Rift S soon, and stand before the same choice. I decided I will go to Asgard's Wrath.

Asgard's Wrath is almost **130 GB**. Stormland is about 16 GB. I think this alone is quite telling regarding the content and detail put in the games.

Other than that I think Asgard's Wrath seems like a much more varied game, with different things to do and a much better story. Not to mention the entire Norse mythology theme is very appealing to me. Maybe it's just because I am from a Nordic country, but I always felt the Norse gods are the coolest B)

7936,mimomusic,t2_11leos,"&gt;Compared to the awe i was playing AW and the complexity of it, the more i play stormland i just feel more and more ripped off.

Can't say I agree at all. Stormland is unique and very much the opposite of a rip-off

&gt;Feels more like Robo Recall with the option for free roam than a full standalone game.

With RR still being one of the best things in the space... that sounds kind of amazing as a pitch, whatever ""than .... full standalone"" is supposed to mean, although I can't say this assessment makes a whole lot of sense. The two games couldn't be more different.

&gt;It really gives a feeling that the game just reset itself and you need to start from scratch

That's the premise of all these games though. Be it Diablo or anything else with a NG+ (ever played Ratchet and Clank?), why would you not knock the player down and make the game more difficult? Blasting through things without effort is kind of annoying, to be honest.

&gt;AW and the complexity of it

Hey, I like AW, but let's not pretend like it's particularly complex or anything.

&gt;For everyone who were yet to buy this title, wait for a discount as the 40$ just NOT worth it.

Yeah nah, buy it, refunding is always an option if you really can't stand the game, but it's so worth the money if you're into exploration, amazing design... all the things we have been waiting for in a VR game, to be honest. It's incredibly atmospheric and 40 bucks is no price at all for something of that caliber.

Also, don't listen to these preliminary reviews when we don't even get any insight into the changing world, it's way too early to come to these kind of conclusions.",1573919547,f7o2ay1,t3_dx80e7,/r/oculus/comments/dx80e7/stormland_finished_1st_cycle_opinion_and_bugs/f7o2ay1/,1,oculus,comment

It's very much leaning towards the great side imho. Traversal is top-notch, gunplay is really fun, upgrades are sensible and make for great progress... it's pretty darn good I say and slipstreaming is a reaction-based racing game in and of itself.

The only thing I wish people did was play Sairento. Goddamnit am I mad that people don't take Sairento as a template for 80% of the shooters out there, because the jumping mechanic overshadows anything most conventional games are going for. You won't dynamically climb around your enemies in Stormlands for the most part because handling weapons prevents you from doing too many other things and I really wish I could just arc away someplace else.

8047,rundiablo,t2_ox6z7,"&gt;	360 videos on Youtube show a lot of creativity and enthusiasm, but one problem difficult to look past is the actual resolution and lack of 3D in many of them. If they can find a way to improve the resolution and streaming quality of these 360 vids and add 3D, that would be a huge jump in immersion.

This was something Carmack painstakingly worked on, he brought this up specifically in fact at OC6 (he first talked about fixing 360 video in OC3 and OC4). 

He hammered out a perfectly optimized 360 video framework that allowed for a locked 60FPS experience without the frame drops common in video, and supported full **5K** resolution video rendered to the GearVR and Oculus Go’s full 1440p screen resolution (instead of the 1280x1280 eye box games had to use) by tapping deep into the Qualcomm video processor and using these viewport regions to max out the capability - all at a really high bitrate and in true 3D. He did all of this work and showcased it with the Henry 360 video you can download on GearVR and Go, then released the full source code so anybody can use it. 

And... nobody used it. A Full 3D, high res, high bitrate, zero frameskip 360 video framework is out there free to use and it landed like a fart in the wind. He mentioned at OC6 how disappointed he was by that, among a number of other things he did that nobody else bothered to use. (such as timewarp layers for super crisp text) 

Kinda goes to my original point above. He obsessed over aspects of VR he felt needed serious attention like 360 video and text rendering and web rendering - but it was never adopted once he released the work. I have to imagine, and his was backed up by the overall somber tone of his OC6 keynote, that it all began to weigh on him. He got the core essentials in place that allow VR to work on mobile chips at all and it now underpins Go/Quest, but everything else he’s tried to push the fluidity and immersion of the experience has largely gone un-utilized and ignored. At some point anybody of his skill will say “time to move onto something else”.",1573787756,f7jvs20,t1_f7i6imv,/r/oculus/comments/dw0bdc/john_carmack_moving_to_a_consulting_cto_position/f7jvs20/,1,oculus,comment

*Oculus Link* turns the *Quest* into a *streaming PCVR* device, not a *native PCVR* device.

That means that the *Quest* is not *quite* as good for *PCVR* as the *Rift S* for multiple reasons:

* lower framerate - 72Hz
* smaller render target *(lower resolution video, said to even be lower than on CV1 but I cannot find an official source for this.)*
* mandatory *fixed foveated rendering* *(Really [ADDT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gocUADwqo8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=671), but I consider it a form of FFR because it prioritizes the center of the image, a pseudo fovea, over the edges of the image.)*
* capped 150Mbs video stream *(this may change but it will never match DisplayPort)*
* latency issues causing video artifacts, [*Sean Liu* from Oculus](https://youtu.be/K2zLneGGbk8?t=968)
* heavier
* one less tracking camera
* straps instead of halo *(subjective but makes a difference for long play sessions)*
* pentile  OLED *(subjective, but a lot of people think the Rifts S LCD is better for games)*

None of those are huge, but they add up especially, if you are looking for a PCVR focused device.

Don't take my word on it [here is what Carmack has to say about it](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1178332857909043201?s=20), and  [his comments about Beat Saber over Oculus Link](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1178721529741352960?s=20).

**Note:** If you have an IPD that is not supported by the *Rift S*, the physical IPD adjustment of the *Quest* can easily outweigh all of the items above, but if you don't need the physical IPD adjustment, I find it hard to believe that the *Quest* is the right choice for someone who is focused on *PCVR*.",1573788421,f7jwnym,t3_dwkrfa,/r/oculus/comments/dwkrfa/quest_vs_rift_s/f7jwnym/,1,oculus,comment

Having said that, it's easier to climb in relatively slow, methodical swings. Reach up with the left, grab, swing yourself up with full range of motion and drift a bit. Simultaneously reach up with the other hand, grab, repeat. Basically you don't go left-right-left-right in short steps, where you don't release the left until the right has a good grip. Instead you go leeeeeeft, drift up a  little bit, then riiiiiiiight, again drift up a bit and leeeeeeft again. What initially took me maybe 20-25 short methodical motions I could later do in 7-8 wide swings.

With these settings i get around 10% asw during intense scenes.  When forcing ASW on i can max the game out just fine though it does make your characters body pretty jittery.  The very first scene in the game where you have access to the graphics menu is a realistic representation of performance during intense scenes.

The game does have very flexible graphics settings, with low settings being very forgiving, and every setting you turn up to medium from low causing about a 5-10% drop to performance headroom. Most settings have very little performance impact beyond the transition from low to medium.  I would reccomend turning the specular probe option off if using ASW, it causes pretty intense artifacting in shiny areas.  I would note that my mobile cpu is the absolute minimum spec i would reccomend, the game often pushes it to 90% usage.",1573794038,f7k40rf,t3_dwl38m,/r/oculus/comments/dwl38m/stormland_specs_and_performance_thread/f7k40rf/,1,oculus,comment

One one side there's the Quest, which offers standalone VR without any wire, and sometime this week is supposed to get a beta of the new Link mode, where it can connect to your gaming PC and basically act as a Rift S. Except nobody is sure how well it will work, with everybody's opinions ranging from ""it will be perfect and completely replace the Rift S"" to ""it will be total garbage"". Reality will probably be somewhere in the middle, with many pros and cons. If you're interested in that, soon will be the time to buy a Quest.

And on the Rift S side, it looks to be getting a $50 discount for Black Friday. The Quest is not supposed to receive this discount. So *if* Link turns out to be garbage, and you're only interested in PC VR, soon will be the time to buy a Rift S.

8259,thegarbz,t2_4mkn3ul,"Perfect and best-ish are two very different word. Minesweeper is a perfect game, but it sure as heck is not the best game, not even close. 

Whether something is perfect or not is measurable. Whether something is the best or not is subjective and depends on what a person wants out of the game. 

Another example: Nier Automata is in my opinion a solid 5 out 5 with my only regret being I can't give it a 6 out of 5. It is definitely not perfect though. The control system isn't ideal, it has a strange learning curve, the PC port (still has) internal rendering problems which a modder fixed dramatically improving graphics, it's poorly optimised, but I'll be dammed if I don't consider it the best game I played in 2017.",1573802074,f7kbmz1,t1_f7k5iqd,/r/oculus/comments/dwckq8/it_sometimes_saddens_me_to_a_be_a_part_of_the_vr/f7kbmz1/,1,oculus,comment

So here's what happens in that circumstance. 

People get excited about a game with depth coming to vr at X date. People then make changes to their life such as taking holidays from work and robbing grannies to buy said game on time(as they're not cheap). 

Developers then drop the ball and the game you've bought isn't ready. The holiday you've taken is wasted and you've just robbed s granny. All of this because developers are too incompetent to screen their games for bugs properly before release.(this is a big problem in the gaming industry atm).

The reason why stuff like this is the norm nowadays even with AAA titles is that they can get away with it. At the end of the day, we're still buying their buggy release and will be buying their next.

And just to be clear, I'm not bitching that Stormland was delayed. This is about people going out of their way to defend companies like they should get special treatment than the rest of the world for what is ultimately just a business like any other.",1573806334,f7keqpt,t1_f7k0b4w,/r/oculus/comments/dwckq8/it_sometimes_saddens_me_to_a_be_a_part_of_the_vr/f7keqpt/,1,oculus,comment

so, for your project, i thought of 2 possible options,    1  if you can get pc software for the drone,  and it has a side by side display option, you could boot up big screen on your pc, run the software  put big screen into side by side, and in theory you would get a  3d image of the drones output in front of you.

or, if your drone only has android software, you could download an android emulator for pc, and then use it in bigscreen side by side mode.

For localizing a program, you must plan that in advance, specially in the videogame industry, where allways has been the publisher who does it, not the developper.

So before you start the game, the publisher must agree with the developper on formats, workflows, and everything that will be related to the localizatión. 

The localization is done at the end, but if you don't plan it before, when it's time to localize, the developper will not have exactly what the publisher need.

What i did was i went into my Privacy settings for the camera in the windows 10 settings app. Then after i was there i just turned everything on for the camera privacy settings and like 5 seconds afterwards the tracking came back and i was no longer stuck in place. I dont know what i turned on there that fixed it but just turn on everything it fixed it for me. Half of those things probably will not do anything but its better to be safe then sorry.,1573819471,f7knjov,t3_dwd3fu,/r/oculus/comments/dwd3fu/anyone_else_having_motion_tracking_rift_s_problems/f7knjov/,1,oculus,comment

And it was my Go To game to work out with. But then they ""new and improved"" it, and suddenly the targets were hard to see (when they went from 4 colors down to 2, it made it trickier to see which punches they wanted), and the punch detection was suddenly really inaccurate. 

Now I've only played it a couple of times in the last year due to all of their ""improvements"", but recent reviews show a lot of changes, so will be giving it a go again in the near future to see if playability has improved at all, since it WAS so great when I first got it.

Well the game that is... the original stream I did... not so much. As it always is when I try to live stream a game things got glitchy and I had some tech difficulties. This caused me to end the stream after only about 30 minutes into the game.

After the first stream I had many people reach out and ask if I was going to show more of the game and I am happy to say that yes I am. Since we are still one day away from launch and since I am sure there are still a lot of people wanting to see some gameplay pre-launch I have decided to try this again tonight. Come along with me on my journey through Stormland and lets chat about this game and all things VR related! \[\]-)

Stormland releases on 11/14/19 so if you want to experience this game, and I highly suggest that you do, then make sure to grab a copy from the link below! \[\]-)

The positive is that the 3d effect is pretty good for a move.

The negative is the low resolution and how uncomfortable it is to wear a VR headset for that long. 

The environment is the standard oculus TV environment and I found that rather distracting, this resolved itself because I had to take the headset off shortly after starting the movie and when I put it back on the environment had become a black void with only the movie screen in front of me.

8672,KrishanuAR,t2_4b1o8,"And yet Carmack made the comments that he did...

Definitely agree on the Quest. That was a no-brained early adopter choice for me. But mainstream popularity really hasn’t taken off for as long as it’s been out, and there really aren’t that many experiences with a broad appeal.

I think part of the problem is that VR today is an extremely anti social experience. I have loads of friends want to come over and try out VR, but it always turns out to be a bore for anyone without the headset on. And they are completely disconnected from those around them.

Even with flat video games, people can watch you play, but spectating VR in person is a really shitty experience even if what they see is projected on screen.

The closest decent spectating experience is those streams where folks have elaborate green room setups... but that doesn’t scale.",1573709633,f7gnkhq,t1_f7gmmnf,/r/oculus/comments/dw0bdc/john_carmack_moving_to_a_consulting_cto_position/f7gnkhq/,1,oculus,comment

Today I finally got the chance to explore Insomniac's new VR game Stormland and so far I'd have to say that it is absolutely amazing! Well the game that is... the original stream I did... not so much. As it always is when I try to live stream a game things got glitchy and I had some tech difficulties. This caused me to end the stream after only about 30 minutes into the game.

After the first stream I had many people reach out and ask if I was going to show more of the game and I am happy to say that yes I am. Since we are still one day away from launch and since I am sure there are still a lot of people wanting to see some gameplay pre-launch I have decided to try this again tonight. Come along with me on my journey through Stormland and lets chat about this game and all things VR related! \[\]-)

Stormland releases on 11/14/19 so if you want to experience this game, and I highly suggest that you do, then make sure to grab a copy from the link below!\[}-)

8782,przemo-c,t2_hb1ub,"&gt;I think part of the problem is that VR today is an extremely anti social experience. I have loads of friends want to come over and try out VR, but it always turns out to be a bore for anyone without the headset on. And they are completely disconnected from those around them.

Staring at a phone during a get-together is often ""the norm"" it's less isolating but at times it's hard to define a meaningfull difference.

But there are few games that engage more people. With asymmetric gameplay. 

Keep talking and nobody explodes is pretty great when you divide chapters across people and one defuses it.

Even I expect you to die with casting can work nicely with collective solving the puzzle.

And that's only mittigation of anti-sotial IRL multiple people. But online... It's more social than just voice chat in game. With way people move/gesture.

I think an issue is hassle/comfort/cost. And some of that won't get entirely solves so it has to be counterballanced with kick ass contente be it gaming apps or experiences.

&gt;The closest decent spectating experience is those streams where folks have elaborate green room setups... but that doesn’t scale.

I think the window into VR with an ipad was a pretty neat way to spectate. Giving the viewer more control over the spectating experience. And if you'd add some form or interaction like marking targets alerting to enemies outside of player view or playing a support role. That would be pretty great.

As for John Carmack... I hoped he'd stay for longer as the pace of VR development and how much improvement there is to gain is still pretty great. I wouldn't expect him to slog over minor advancements that we have in pretty mature segment of smartphones. But i hoped he'd pour more of his brain into VR. But from a personal standpoint i get it. I bet there was some corpo stuff that bogged him down but also working on same stuff can get exhausting. Hope he'll do great in AGI that won't try to rocket jump of humans ;]",1573717771,f7gu5vu,t1_f7gnkhq,/r/oculus/comments/dw0bdc/john_carmack_moving_to_a_consulting_cto_position/f7gu5vu/,1,oculus,comment

8830,r4ind4nce,t2_nrm3g,"I had the Quest since shortly after launch and got the Rift S a few days ago. With the Quest it's been smooth sailing, both in Quest-specific content (except Beat Saber which simply didn't work well for me) as well as streaming PCVR content via a 5GHz router. It's not perfect, but it's getting better all the time and once Oculus Link is here you always have the option to use that to get in the Rift ecosystem if the streaming is to wonky for you. That aside, many games on Quest can be played with people on Rift if you add them as friends.

The Rift S on the other hand worked for two days and then suddenly wouldn't accept any of my USB 3.0 (and 3.1) ports, even after getting a recommended pcie USB card. Instead of playing a lot of VR like I could when I got the Quest I've spent hours upon hours of my valuable time troubleshooting and not even getting close to fixing the problem. I've got kids and a full time job, the evenings are the only time when I can do hobby stuff. I'd say if you want a wide variety of options and mostly hassle-free VR (wireless on top of that) get the Quest. The Rift S seems to be prone to software and connectivity issues and frankly, if I don't get this fixed within the week it's going back, all this fiddling is just not worth my time.

Have a set time in VR like 15 to 30mins at first. Stay hydrated. Eat something before VR play. Try doing breathing exercises before VR. Try not fitting the headset on too tight, keep it loose. Try sitting down during VR sessions.

1. check if your USB cable is connected to headset, sometimes it is not entirely connected. Thats why nothing lights up. Plug in only USB cable and check you Device Manager, you sould see if anything is connected, if you see Rift S recognised, if you dont see any new device appearing, then it must be that you headset is not connected. Disassemble you headset to disconnect and reconnect cable.
2. Be sure, that USB port you are connecting to is actually USB3, try other ports, disconnect any other USB devices.
3. Plug in only USB cable and check device manager, if there is Rift S device, then issue will be your USB port, if you tried all ports and you are sure that your port is USB3, then it might by unsupported or too old, try on another PC or just by PCI Express card with USB 3",1573728082,f7h0ubp,t3_dw54cy,/r/oculus/comments/dw54cy/stuck_on_this_screen_the_light_on_my_rift_doesnt/f7h0ubp/,1,oculus,comment

I don't get why you are in a VR sub, and presumably a VR owner, and so intent to defend harmful journalism that regurgitates myths about the VR medium. There are tons of amazing VR games, and tons of VR games with excellent storytelling. Either you and the reviewer haven't played them, or you and the reviewer have subjective taste that you're then using to disparage a large catalogue of games in a public way as if it is objective fact.

I can list a ton of VR games with amazing stories (and polish, but the quote is about STORIES) because I've played them. And I know there's lots I haven't played. In no particular order:

- Transference

- Resident Evil 7

- The Solus Project

- Déraciné 

- Here They Lie

- Virtual Virtual Reality

- Invisible Hours

- Ghost Giant

- Luna

- Moss

- Bound

- Statik

- A FIsherman's Tale

- The Lost Bear

- Pixel Ripped 1989

- Arca's Path

- Xing: The Land Beyond

- Eleven Eleven

- Trover Saves the Universe

- Batman: Arkham VR

- Wilson's Heart (only game on my list that I wouldn't recommend, but the storytelling is good and most people would probably like it. Just has some gameplay flaws that hurt the experience too much for me)

(- No Man's Sky)


I've mostly played on PSVR and have a huge catalogue of PCVR open to me now, so there's tons of great games I haven't yet played also.

8941,databeestje,t2_yyodx,"This ignores the fact that countries have been running on nuclear for decades at competitive prices. The consumer price of electricity in France is lower than Lazard's purported cost.

Remember that Lazard bases its estimate entirely on the AP1000 build in Vogtle, which is the first reactor the US builds in 30 years. It also only assumes a 40 year lifetime (it will likely double that), uses a high discount rate and doesn't take into account the system costs of solar and wind, only the cost of a single generator. It doesn't take into account the diminishing value of intermittent electricity when wind/solar is abundant. In short, LCOE is a flawed metric to use.

That is not to say that new nuclear is not expensive, it's a huge upfront cost, especially when using private capital and there is definitely a lot of room for improvement. But even the stupidly expensive Hinkley Point C has a construction cost of around 1 cent per KWh when taken from over its 60 year lifetime. Paid off nuclear plants in the US generate electricity at prices of $30/MWh. As a short term investment they're far too expensive and have too much regulatory uncertainty and risk, but they have phenomenal value as long term investment for a country.

It has an amazing world with mechanics that add a huge sense of scale and wonder. The combat is good for the most part, but I found the followers actually made it harder, and they are pretty much useless when against a shielded enemy.

The story is good and interesting for each hero character you play, and I thought the overall story was fine, but it was pretty predictable from the get go, considering the God you are working with.

9085,Easelaspie,t2_dj42f,"Depending on how portable you want to be. If you want a high end laptop, something like the [alienware area 51m](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/alienware-17-area51m-laptop). It's designed to be a proper desktop replacement, and is upgradeable (GPU will be modules from alienware directly, all the other components including the CPU, RAM and storage can be upgraded with off the shelf PC parts). It is bulky and huge though (4kg), but the all-in-one nature of it including screen gives you actual portability with pretty incredible power (i9-9900K), and the space to pack in proper cooling too, so you'll actually be able to get the most out of the hardware (super needed, as it uses 2 power adapters with a combined draw of over 500W). It also includes an alienware Graphics Amplifier port, which you could use to house an additional GPU when you're back at base to help run all those extra monitors and heavy rendering (Is the software mostly CPU based or can it be GPU accelerated) or you could use a thunderbolt GPU enclosure, but I'd advise their first party solution.  


If you want a compact high power prebuilt, I know Oculus Studios, Epic and a bunch of others use Falcon NW Tiki systems. Very expensive but very well built machines. Falcon also have a similar laptop to the Area 51m ([Falcon DRX](https://www.falcon-nw.com/laptops/drx/design)).

9133,TheLavalampe,t2_m4gwg,"The visuals and reduction in screendoor effect are way ahead of the cv1, this alone makes it a worthy upgrade. 

While they could create a pro variant with a higher refresh rate and better audio (or you just use headphones which is easier to replace when it breaks) this would also increase the cost which is probably not something they aim for.

The sensor tracking of the cv1 was a complete mess and while it worked it was horrible to setup. They really did some black magic with the insight out tracking of the rift s and while its hard to belief without trying you won't really notice a difference betweeen the two tracking methods and if you used 2 sensors instead of 3 i would go as far as calling it a straight up upgrade.

As for the link cable making the rift s obsolete thats not really the case  since the link cable just streams the data to your quest similar to what the wifi solution can already do kjust better. Due to this you will suffer from decompression and compression artifacts, the display wont use its full ressolution and there a probably some more tricks at work that make it achievable but i don't want to say anything wrong so  i will leave it at those two. So the rift s is still going to be your go to oculus device if your focus is pcvr.

This led to Sony wanting a piece of the action and drove things even further.  

Exclusives were a big driving factor in this competition.

9207,rolliejoe,t2_fowzi,"My wife and I have both put a bunch of hours into this, while also putting hundreds and hundreds of hours into other VR Rhythm games.  IMO the key points about Dance Central are:


1) It comes with the best *included* song selection by *far* of all the VR Rhythm games (that don't require 3rd party accessories).  There are 40+ tracks included with the base price and all are popular music.  Everyone's taste varies of course, but the tracks here are 100% guaranteed to appeal to the most people, as they are actual hit music.  


2) It is the only VR game that mimics to a decent degree real dancing.  Sure, there are really well-mapped fan-made Beatsaber tracks where you *feel* like you are dancing to the music, and some of the other VR rhythm games also push the ""feels like dancing"" point, but nothing else is even *remotely* close.  If you like dancing IRL and want to simulate it in VR, this is the *only* decent option.


3) It is extremely difficult to improve at.  Unlike other VR rhythm games, most people are either going to be good or bad at this one right away, and the improvement curve is small to non-existent.  After playing 30+ hours of Dance Central including spending a few hours in the tutorial mode, I'm not significantly better than the very first song I played (I'm a terrible dancer IRL as well).  Whereas my wife is a good dancer IRL, and was immediately good at Dance Central the very first song.  Contrasted to something like Beatsaber, ""Hard"" songs were initially challenging for us, but now we can pass most Expert+ and sleep through all the Experts.  


I've posted this elsewhere, but my take on VR Rhythm gaming is: Dance Central if you want to actually dance, Audica if you want a hardcore timing-based classic rhythm game challenge, and Beatsaber for everyone else.",1573637038,f7dyo2m,t3_dvlzdk,/r/oculus/comments/dvlzdk/dance_central_vr_the_best_vr_rhythm_game/f7dyo2m/,1,oculus,comment

9214,vectraCPC,t2_qixkq3,"I don't want to offend anyone, but the VR quality offered by this mod is extremely low. I consider it is not acceptable, period.

As said in the mod, the author 'just' achieved stereotaxy in rendering a single '1000*1000' image at '90' Hz for the computational cost of a Full HD image at 45 Hz. At each frame, the camera is shifted from the left eye to the right eye position; you can clearly see this if you launch the game in non-VR mode with the mod still installed.

So, not only you don't have 90 Hz stereotaxic rendering, but even at 45 Hz it's unaccurate because the left &amp; right frames do not show the scene from the same viewpoint. It is excessively obvious if you drive a car in exterior view mode: not only are the surroundings blurry, they also are impossible to visualize.

The author of the mod clearly explains what he did and why, and I have nothing about it, but please stop bragging about playing GTA in VR. No, the quality is not acceptable; it draws us 2 decades earlier in terms of immersion quality. It makes us VR adopters appear stupid and contented by any poor s**t for the rest of the audience. GTA was not designed for VR and this mod can't repair such a loss at an acceptable cost.

If you are into dancing, this song list feels great since its got a bit of variation, but it fits for actual routines and things. The one thing that actually surprised me about Dance Central VR was the quality of the writing. Getting messages on your cell phone from the different characters and meeting up with them or unlocking their favorite routines for songs and trying to improve your scores on those is so rewarding. The thing is, not everyone is going to be looking to actually dance, so even though its an excellent rhythm game, I think that is a major hurdle when things like Audica, Beat Saber, Pistol Whip, and others exist where you are more focused on hitting the notes and dodging things instead of actually being aware of your body, head, and hand positions when actually dancing.

On a related note, are the LIV team working on anything with using a static image of the room as a mask vs. needing a green screen?

I have many acquaintances who are tech people but have the barest awareness of/interest in VR, and I'm sure other people have friends and relatives like that. I wish it was easier for people to create their own mixed reality game play videos, even if the videos are kind of amateurish, so they can show the videos to people as a way to get people more interested in the possibilities of VR.

As for ""Xbox 360 processing power"", that's common argument, but Carmack debunked it either on Oc6 or oc5. In terms of FLOPS metric - yea, it's x360 level. But GPUs that are used in mobile have different architecture, vastly more bandwidth oriented than latency-focused. So, in effect you can't render x360-like graphics on Quest, but you could mine similar amounts of some crypto like Monero on both.

Let me preface saying that I too have a tattoo, it's not an Oculus logo it's some sheet music and it's right to say that one can't know the meaning of a tattoo just by watching it, there's almost always a personal experience and personal values behind it.

That said I'd never get a tattoo for a brand, be it Oculus or Apple or Android, be it the best or the worst company in the world, and that's because it's a logo for a company much more than it's for a concept, and if in the future Oculus would be the worst VR company in the world I wouldn't like to be associated with that. Instead I would have researched and study a way to express my feelings and love for VR and these experiences with a much bigger and complicated illustration.

I'm sorry for the OP but I'd never get this tattoo, and I think I'm not the only one here. I'd rather like to see a little tattoo of an headset or maybe a bigger tattoo with the faceplate and the two lenses with a game scene viewed inside them.

9319,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"I said this before and I'll say it again - right now it's much better to have a PC+VR hybrid than a pure VR game in terms of pushing user adoption.

No Man's Sky is an excellent example - PC and VR players get to play together, and PC players get to see just how amazing VR is, by watching the VR player side-by-side with them. We can wave, fist-bump, punch with one hand and shoot with another, we can shoot a sentinel and loot at the same time, we can easily look around and find things much faster, etc. That really helps drive players' curiosity to try VR. As opposed to just making a game a VR exclusive, at which point everyone not in VR will just write it off as a lost cause.

I know this from personal experience - when I see a console exclusive, the game is dead to me, I don't bother to research it, or look at any coverage about it, it's a console game, and I'm a PC gamer.

Bottom like, this doesn't need to be either-or thing, or an us-vs-them situation. Ideally, games need to be pancake + VR hybrids, both for the game's population to remain vibrant, and to passively push VR. The mentality would be hey, I'm playing this game, I love this game, but it sure looks like that guy over there is having even more fun with this game, which I already love. And yeah, the headset costs as much as a new video card, but my video card is decent, and Black Friday is coming up, maybe I'll try it! And bam, you got another VR adopter. Whereas VR exclusivity just means ""Oh, it's a VR game? Moving on...""

The only exception would be a super-mega-massive platform seller game. Like if Valve released Half Life 3 as VR exclusive, and the game was actually great, yes people would bitch and moan, but I'm bet you dollars to doughnuts the VR headset sales would get a massive jump. And they could always release a pancake a year later, Rockstar-style.

And that's the second thing VR really, really needs right now - a social phenomenon, similar to WoW. Before it came along, biggest MMO has 275-375k subscribers (UO in '03), after WoW came out and crossed into the millions, when Blizzard optimistically expected to top out at 500k subs, MMO landscape changed. And we got a ton of MMOs out of it, and WoW is still alive after 15 years, still selling full price expansions every couple of years and raking in subscriptions. We need a VR WoW equivalent, something that is more than just a game, but a social phenomenon that everybody and their grandma played at one point or another. Something like it, but in VR, would go a long way towards pulling people in. 

Having said all this, I LOATHE exclusivity bullshit! It's bad enough when a company that developed the product keeps it in their own store, like EA with Anthem on Origin, or Ubisoft with Assassin's Creed on UPlay.

The game doesn't use any controllers, all interaction is based on gaze and head movement. I spent the first few minutes wondering what was going on until I realized that the batteries were charged, just that the game didn't want them :D

9326,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"I still don't know how Rift S is affected by the Link, or why that would put it in a weird place or obsolete it.

Rift S is wired. As soon as you wire up a Quest, it becomes a Rift S. As soon as you unplug the Quest, you can't play too many games (such as Asgard or Stormland) or in much, much worse quality, not to mention the games are all freakishly expensive (correct me if I'm wrong, but Quest hasn't had any sales on games yet). So how is any of it obsoleting a Rift S? And that's ignoring the fact that Quest with Link is still worse than Rift S (foveated, compressed image, lower refresh, albeit with crispier blacks, and comfort level is way lower). The only thing where Quest is objectively superior is the IPD adjustment, which isn't a factor for vast majority of players (since IPD is a bell curve that peaks on Rift S's default setting).

All Quest Link does is increase the flexibility of Quest, but it doesn't affect the Rift S.

The fate of Rift S is that it's a decent headset, and very good for the money you spend on it. It's very easy to set up and super accessible. Quality is nice. We'll be using it for years. And with any luck, a year or two down the line we might get a WiFi dongle for it, which will turn it into a Quest. And then we'll be talking about the fate of Quest.",1573649437,f7e7gvm,t3_dvniw9,/r/oculus/comments/dvniw9/the_fate_of_the_rift_s/f7e7gvm/,1,oculus,comment

9330,Sabbathius,t2_eue8e,"You can use controllers. But a word of warning, I couldn't get into this game AT ALL, it has some weird design choices. Like, some rooms require you to find a key, which gets boring fast, before you can advance. The dungeon layout is random, and there's no map, and everything looks the same, so it's very easy to get lost. The audio is weird, I often can't tell where the enemy is. The combat mechanics are also weird - you have to bring the right weapon for the right enemy, and if you don't, you'll have a bad time. But you don't know what the enemies will be until you enter, by which point it's too late. Weapons are also poorly balanced, and combat isn't particularly deep or interesting. 

Mind you, this might just be me. But I bought it, and over several months barely got 3 hrs of play into it, and even that was a struggle. But when it comes to controls options, there's many. You literally walk into an options room, with buttons on the walls, and you can adjust a ton of things about controls and movement within the game.",1573649699,f7e7q7r,t3_dvna7x,/r/oculus/comments/dvna7x/vr_dungeon_knight_question/f7e7q7r/,1,oculus,comment
9331,stbest95,t2_39zfyrw,"You are misunderstanding how the tracking works.

Yes, the cameras can see infrared, and this is used to track the controllers.

But the headset itself doesnt produce its own light, so its dependant on the lighting in your room in order to track its position. The tracking will not work if your room is too dark.

If you arent playing in a pitch black room, its possible that you are either getting too much light (large windows) or the tracking is thrown off by things like mirrors.",1573649743,f7e7rtl,t1_f7e55tm,/r/oculus/comments/dvm9di/rift_s_software_has_really_improved/f7e7rtl/,1,oculus,comment

**Supported Platforms:** Windows

#About This Game

Welcome to Synthesis Universe - Story -  
  
Story is the first release within Synthesis Universe.  
It is an introduction, succession of musical sequences all linked through a
central hub.  
It is not a game, even if the world is aware of your actions.  
Expect a unique level of immersion, no menu or text, pure true VR
interactions.  
Each sequence is a story moment, inspired by the structure of the music. Every
note, every beat is alive and surround you.  
Welcome to Synthesis Universe.  
  
  
Episode 00 is about you, who are you in that story.  
It contains 4 main sequences, built around a Hub and a Timeline room (That
opens after the first run).  
It's a hybrid between traditional movie story telling, music video and game,
all happening in real time using Unreal Engine 4.  
  
**Important notes:**  
No guns, no violence: enjoy it the way you want: for the music, for the
visual, for it's unique immersion or for the story, looking everywhere for all
the details that make this world alive. Not everything will be obvious and in
your face, everything has a reason to be here.  
  
This is not a puzzle game, nor an exploration game, no locomotion.  
It's all about the story and how it is told through musical sequences and
unique visual.  
  
  
**CAUTION:** Built entirely for VR:  
As a true 360 musical experience, Standing strongly recommended, 360 necessary
sometimes.  
(Playing seated is possible but not optimal)  
  
Can be played just standing up, with very limited play space!  
Minimum room scale play space: 1.5m2 or 10feet2 is ok. (User standing up with
regular arm use)  
_Try to go off bounds!_  
  
Mostly gaze activated, the motion controllers are not much used in Episode 00  
  
Play time is about 30 minutes, but time is not limited.  
No save game, each time you start is like the first start, so it's possible
for you to share this experience among your friends and family.  
  
Watch the trailer for a dive into the Universe and music style.  
Enjoy!

9364,LostHisDog,t2_x5jky,"Nope.

It's first generation technology that's going to be outdated in no time. None of the currently shipping headsets have anything close to good enough resolution or field of view to be ""future proof"". 

For all we know Microsoft could release a new set of headsets tomorrow at half the price and double the specs. Can't really future proof an evolving technology.

With that said there's plenty of fun to be had with the Rift S as it is today even if it's ""outdated"" tomorrow. If you have enough disposable income and are interested in VR it's as good a place to start as any. They'll be $50 cheaper on Black Friday through Lenovo's site.

UE does have an easy route to development that I think can be simpler than Unity, and that's by using Blueprints.

Blueprints provide a visual design to building your game that doesn't need any coding.

You can get some elements of visual design in Unity via assets (e.g. Playmaker) but Blueprints is officially supported in UE, and so has many more examples and tutorials to work from.

I'm actually a Unity dev myself, so I'm not promoting UE!

This isn't really a meaningful statement given the relative age of the platforms, and the architectural differences between them.  
  
&gt;The reason you don't see great AAA games on phones is because interacting with them sucks,  
  
This isn't true, the reason you don't see rich AAA experiences is mostly the same reason we don't have them in VR yet: The audience for them does not live on that platform in large enough numbers to support them.  The NintendoDS had far less relative hardware grunt, was a NIGHTMARE in terms of interface elements, and still saw plenty of AAA production. 
    
&gt;The Quest doesn't have that problem, because it's interface capabilities are essentially identical to the desktop rift.    
  
The super nintendo is capable of a great interface.  This isn't about hardware.

9473,TheLavalampe,t2_m4gwg,"The thing is most pcvr games are designed with controllers in mind. So it makes sense to offer a headset with controllers. Since basically everyone wants a headset with controllers it doesnt make much sense to sell your device without controllers and doing so would probably not allow them to drop the price too much anyways.

So your only real option is to hope to find a second hand headset with broken controllers so you get a steep discount. 

Other than that i would generally don't advice a windows mixed reality headset because i find the controllers horrible and their controlller tracking worse than the competition (although certainly usable). But since you don't care for that that shouldnt bother you. So a cheap wmr headset might be your best bet although there is certainly a big difference in visuals between the cheapest wmr headsets like the lenovo explorer and the more expensive ones like the odyssey plus or hp reverb. But well the more expensive wmr headsets are more expensive so so at that point i would get a rift s for the better tracking.

9489,JorgTheElder,t2_fcqx9,"
Here is my opinion as posted elsewhere. Apologies to those who have seen it multiple times, but this topic gets posted several times a day. *We really need a sticky thread for it.*

*Oculus Link* turns the *Quest* into a *streaming PCVR* device, not a *native PCVR* device.

That means that the *Quest* is not *quite* as good for *PCVR* as the *Rift S* for multiple reasons:

* lower framerate - 72Hz
* smaller render target *(lower resolution video, said to even be lower than on CV1 but I cannot find an official source for this.)*
* mandatory *fixed foveated rendering* *(Really [ADDT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gocUADwqo8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=671), but I consider it a form of FFR because it prioritizes the center of the image, a pseudo fovea, over the edges of the image.)*
* capped 150Mbs video stream *(this may change but it will never match DisplayPort)*
* latency issues causing video artifacts, [*Sean Liu* from Oculus](https://youtu.be/K2zLneGGbk8?t=968)
* heavier
* one less tracking camera
* straps instead of halo *(subjective but makes a difference for long play sessions)*
* pentile  OLED *(subjective, but a lot of people think the Rifts S LCD is better for games)*

None of those are huge, but they add up especially, if you are looking for a PCVR focused device.

Don't take my word on it [here is what Carmack has to say about it](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1178332857909043201?s=20), and  [his comments about Beat Saber over Oculus Link](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1178721529741352960?s=20).

**Note:** If you have an IPD that is not supported by the *Rift S*, the physical IPD adjustment of the *Quest* can easily outweigh all of the items above, but if you don't need the physical IPD adjustment, I find it hard to believe that the *Quest* is the right choice for someone who is focused on *PCVR*.",1573657305,f7egxza,t3_dvniw9,/r/oculus/comments/dvniw9/the_fate_of_the_rift_s/f7egxza/,1,oculus,comment

9505,drakfyre,t2_46apm,"Oh, didn't try that.  I'm on Oculus so I always use the grips as hold and much prefer it that way.  I feel like if you are locked on the controls you should stay locked whether it's a grip or a snap, but I also can understand why they'd make a breakaway distance so that folks wouldn't get confused as to why they can't move their hands to their canopy or whatever.

But the important part here is it gives me a glimpse into why you don't like the controls.  I currently grab the stick wherever and then move my hand to a resting position; you don't even have that option if there's a breakaway threshold.  Most of the advantages that the game has in using a rotational control scheme (they don't use position at all in determining your controls, only the tilt) are lost if you can't freely re-position your controllers.

&gt; And ground vehicles need fixing - player position should be fixed relative to the car, currently you are stationary and the car just bounces all around you.

While I'd rather have it the other way (as I said in my previous post) it needs to be an option.  The reason it is how it is right now is for folks with ""motion"" sickness (really horizon sickness in this case).  It's not a thing that needs ""fixing"" in the way you say, it was a very intentional decision by the team.",1573525964,f7acliw,t1_f7ab6ub,/r/oculus/comments/duruov/no_mans_sky_vr_status_after_three_months/f7acliw/,1,oculus,comment

The quest has much better optics than CV1, and the Rift S has even better still. The issue with getting another S is that I can just use the CV1 for desktop gaming.

Quest being wire free is really a big deal. Try playing room scale Thrill of the Fight on rift/rift S and you'll see how much better it is with Quest just by virtue of being able to jump and fly around the ring. Add to it the portability of bringing it where you want and play anywhere in your house without any real setup.

9553,TomC69,t2_qpbs6ed,"I also have a Rift cv1 w/2x sensors (I also have a 3rd sensor but don’t find I need to use it).  I preordered a Rift S earlier this year and ended up returning it for a refund because I didn’t think it was much of an upgrade.  The higher resolution was nice but the audio and tracking were nowhere as good.  Using OTT and applying a bit more SS to my cv1 pretty well gave me almost as good a result.  Also the cv1 oled screens are much better in apps with dark backgrounds.  My IPD is 68mm so the mechanical adjustment on the cv1 works better for me as well.

I found the biggest improvement to VR for me was to simply get a better desktop gaming PC (i9 9900k, gtx1080ti, 32gb 3000 ram, 1tb ssd, 4tb hd).  This has allowed me to increase SS and VR game settings significantly and made my Rift cv1 seem like a new headset.

So if I were you I would look at spending $’s to improve your PC performance.

I also have an Oculus Go and I really like this for media, quick VR fixes, and very handy for traveling.  I don’t really need a higher powered mobile VR headset right now but if I did I would probably consider a Quest.

I’m also currently playing with a Vive Cosmos and while the screen resolution and colors are fantastic there are of course a lot of early release issues that need sorting out and I’m still using my Rift cv1 most of the time.

he thinks of things to do that are useful but not complicated. and becasue it's useful you think he's a genius. he is not a genius. 

an example of something useful would be a wirelss usb for usb C to transmit the new quest link data so wire free. the same limitations would apply at 2.4ghz/5ghz as apply now. if you transmit at those frequencies you have limitations because it cannot carry enough data. so the current options for wireless VR use high energy 20ghz to carry the data or we get VD which is great but not perfect. usb has an abilit to handle 5gbps so it should be fine to carry the data but we are limited by the fact usb wireless transmitting uses a single transmitter and receiver for all the data so we have the same limitations of anyy wireless data transmission. 

USB 3 has 12 channels so a simple solution would be a seperate transmitter for each usb data channel and run them at different wireless data channel frequencies within the 5ghz range and that gives you 12x the data would have otherwise, All it would take would be some basic trial and error to get them working. 

Now if i had the cash to inject into investigating this idea and designed it then came up with a fantastic cheap energy efficient solution which revolutionised the wireless VR experience, would you consider me a genius? I'd say no becasue it's simple to use other peoples ideas to do something useful. You would follow a scientific

If he had did that shit today he'd be branded a terrorist for using thermite to cause social disruption.

Now here i have demonstrated how simple it is to come up with revolutionary useful ideas and defended my position of believing he is a psychopath.

&gt;  
&gt; Awarded VR Lifetime Achievement, Not 'Satisfied' With Pace

Im with you on this. I think it is why I am so excited for the likes of Boneworks, that truly look like experiences that can only be had in VR. Im also looking forward to Stormland, and been enjoying the heck out of B2VR regardless of the lackluster VR implementation.   


That being said my two most memorable, immersive and arguably favourite gaming experiences of the past 5 years have both been flat games. Metro Exodus and The Outer Worlds. TOW is the current title taking up all my time. The level of polish, story telling, choice, character, world-building. I could gush about this one all day, I freaking love it (Fallout 3/4 and New Vegas are tied in my top 5 best gaming experiences of all time, so that's where I am coming from). I might as well add Red Dead Redemption 2 to that list. I played it a bit on a friends PS4, but just grabbed it for PC and can already tell it is going way up on that list. The day built from the ground up AAA VR games are of same quality and held to the same standard as the likes of those two, I will have no problem ditching my flat gaming library and playtime. I should mention that my gaming monitor is 34 inch curved ultrawide 120hz paired with a surround system, so my flat gaming experience is more immersive than most.   


VR is no doubt my favourite way to engage with gaming content. That being said I still play most of my games and spend most of my time engaging in content on my monitor. I would say about 20 to 30% of gaming time is VR and the other 70 to 80% is flat. Mostly attributed to the recent release of Asgards and B2VR, I imagine as the content continues to come (Stormland, Boneworks, Valves Flagship titles, Walking Dead Saints and Sinners, Lone Echo 2 etc), my VR playtime will stay the same/increase with it. Even then the fact Cyberpunk 2077 or Diablo 4 (arguably the two upcoming games giving me reason to live lol), have absolutely no chance of being made for VR (Diablo 4 more so, it just wouldn't work well in that format. 2077 may have a chance, wayyy, wayyyy down the line), make it hard for me to see the current reality of my VR use changing much over the years.   


I do hope I am wrong though because I indeed do feel that playing games in VR is in every way superior to my flat gaming experience, where immersion, and mechanics are involved. Give me Red Dead 2 VR implementation and I would almost always pick that over RD2 flat mode even if those were sold as two separate versions",1573556840,f7b5h9k,t1_f7asful,/r/oculus/comments/dv2zuv/john_carmack_says_hes_not_satisfied_with_the_pace/f7b5h9k/,1,oculus,comment

9749,Zackafrios,t2_gk786,"I think you're right for the most part.

Same FoV (actually a bit less I think compared to DK1) and a 1440p screen is pretty diabolical after 7 years.

However, on the flip side, tracking *has* come a long way.

DK1 was a 3dof headset, they were still figuring out how positional tracking was gonna work.

Now we have inside-out positional tracking. So in this regard, I think the pace of development has been decent. Not spectacular (full body tracking), but reasonable enough. We also have hand tracking soon to be released, albeit early stages.

We also have some decent controllers. Oculus touch was ahead of its time imo, and certainly a far cry from what was available at DK1 stage (razer hydra).

So it's been a bit of a mix and match, but the most glaringly disspaointing factor is indeed the visual experience. It's insane after 7 years to only have 1440p and same FoV. Wouldn't have expected that, I thought we'd be on 4k per eye by now with 150° FoV.",1573557141,f7b5opa,t1_f7aye07,/r/oculus/comments/dv310l/carmack_awarded_vr_lifetime_achievement_not/f7b5opa/,1,oculus,comment
9750,fraseyboo,t2_gr0yj,"Bethesda saw another opportunity to re-release Skyrim for $50 and tacked on some VR support that changes your character into a pair of floating hands. It's literally the bare minimum that was required from them. They never bothered to make the world more interactive &amp; friendly for VR, all changes are to the player model and menu. They then kept it as a PSVR exclusive for 6 months to really rake it in.

When they inevitably re-release Skyrim for PS5 &amp; Xbox I'm not going to be impressed by the simple task of porting a decade old game onto now PC-esque hardware yet Skyrim fans will consider it a massive accomplishment and pay another $50.

Skyrim was a pretty solid achievement back in 2011 and I applaud the effort put into it by Bethesda.

I think Carmack might be smarter than Elon. Carmack is more focused but he also seems more technical. That way Elon has a wider impact but Carmack is probably the better engineer. This is only hearsay, but several people who have worked closely with Elon have said that his technical skills are not that impressive.

Armadillo Aerospace was an aerospace startup company based in Mesquite, Texas. Its initial goal was to build a crewed suborbital spacecraft capable of space tourism, and it had also stated long-term ambitions of orbital spaceflight.  The company was founded by John Carmack, former co-founder and chief technical officer of id Software.

On October 24, 2008, Armadillo won $350,000 by succeeding in the Level 1 Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge.

9790,rundiablo,t2_ox6z7,"I agree that VR is likely stuck in that “chicken and egg” situation, a mismatch between investment required to move forward and user engagement. 

I do also feel that we could likely be a bit further ahead without radical investment into all new technologies. From a raw visual standpoint, it does feel like things could’ve been pushed father by now. We’ve seen so many panels shown off over the last few years with sky high resolutions and 120Hz refresh rates, yet both of the mainstream headsets (Rift S and Index) this year fell back to LCDs with fairly pedestrian resolution for 2019. Valve Index is quite impressive overall in pushing optics and refresh rate, but for the price I would’ve imagined something more along the lines of the HP Reverb resolution by now. 

I‘d say Rift and Vive, and even GearVR, were something of a painful realization for the VR industry. While nobody was realistically expecting smartphone numbers out of the gate (...well some were I suppose), and the adoption rates certainly weren’t *catastrophically* bad, I think it’s safe to say they all came in way **way** lower than the industry was anticipating. Low enough that display manufacturers never bothered to put most of those high res VR displays into mass production, promising startups were closing down left and right, and many indie devs were left struggling after their big bet didn’t pay off. It’s likely this current market reality that’s caused such a slowdown in the pace of progress, even if it’s ironically part of the reason consumers have been sitting out VR.",1573560635,f7b8e0o,t1_f7aye07,/r/oculus/comments/dv310l/carmack_awarded_vr_lifetime_achievement_not/f7b8e0o/,1,oculus,comment

9793,rundiablo,t2_ox6z7,"That’s a bit of a double edged sword though, much to /u/refusered’s point. Quest may be that device that unlocks the potential of VR for you and many others, whether it’s due to the lack of cables or the convenience. But that freedom has also brought a significant penalty in hardware - having 10x lower performance than even the minimum spec for PC VR is absolutely a limitation that will hold back compelling content. I don’t think jacking into a PC is the answer there, as then you’ve lost that PC free magic and are back to where PC VR has been all along. 

There are a lot of great ideas and compelling games that simply won’t be possible on the Quest hardware. Not to say there aren’t great experiences today and won’t be more, but the hardware **will** inevitably limit how much impact Quest can ultimately have. Imagine if you can just pick up a Quest and play games like Lone Echo or Asgard’s Wrath tether free and without a gaming PC - that won’t be happening for a long time.",1573561308,f7b8z4i,t1_f7b5hwd,/r/oculus/comments/dv2zuv/john_carmack_says_hes_not_satisfied_with_the_pace/f7b8z4i/,1,oculus,comment

9835,redmercuryvendor,t2_67nn5,"&gt; actually a bit less I think compared to DK1

Only if you go by a random number rather than actually looking into a HMD. DK1 is obviously behind current HMDs even if you pull off the foam and wipe your eyeballs on the lenses. And that's ignoring the absolutely atrocious eyebox volume. 

&gt;A decade forward from DK1? Should have been 8k per eye, full FoV

Why do these sorts of unrealistic pie-in-the-sky predictions persist? Even at the dawn of VR it was clearly stated by those working on it that VR hardware was made possible off the back of smartphone hardware advancement. Smartphone hardware has not had the same sort of resolution progression, so there is no reason to expect a market several orders of magnitude smaller would be able to command greater R&amp;D (let alone the literal billions to commission even a single fab line for device panels).",1573565145,f7bctqu,t1_f7b5opa,/r/oculus/comments/dv310l/carmack_awarded_vr_lifetime_achievement_not/f7bctqu/,1,oculus,comment

9851,toastman42,t2_bjuki,"Counterpoint regarding low resolution and field of view: that really doesn't have much to do with lack of progress on VR (there are headsets out there with higher res displays and larger FOV), rather it has more to do with lack of the necessary computing horsepower to deliver a better visual experience at a reasonable cost.  
  
Not even the top of the line GTX 2080 Ti can handle dual 4k at 90 FPS. In fact, the entire reason the Rift S has the resolution and refresh rate it does is because Oculus wanted to keep the minimum system requirements reasonable.  
  
There are technologies in the works to help offset the need for crazy powerful graphics cards, such as eye tracking and FOViated view, but those are complicated techs that require additional CPU power and additional components. That means they are basically sacrificing resources (CPU and cost) for gains in another resource (graphics).",1573566745,f7benrm,t1_f7b5opa,/r/oculus/comments/dv310l/carmack_awarded_vr_lifetime_achievement_not/f7benrm/,1,oculus,comment

9884,rubberduckfuk,t2_43o34eoo,"I think your missing my point, I'm not presenting myself as being intellegent. I'm presenting myself as being not stupid while stating that carmack is not a genius. he is logical and a psychopath.

I can't really answer you're thoughts on me understanding a spec sheet without actually know what you mean by that. However I am going to assume you mean when it comes to usb 3 and it's 12 channel/wires which it sends data down.

This data is reprsented by electrons or electrons converted to photons then converted to electrons in the case of oculus link cable buyt i will talk in terms of electrons because the theory is the same.

so with link basically you have 12 channels which these elevtrons transmit down and the at the other end you have a collection of what is essentially twists and turns and areas of discharge(charge) of energy which translate the electrons into a particular and specific energy state. there will be a device in the headset which electrons of this particular energy state interact with in order cause a diischarge of light and sound etc from the headset. When it comes to wireless what you need is a device/material which contains it's own twists and turns and areas of discharge which the electrons interact with which radiates energy at particular timings and energy levels and another device/material which interacts with the specific type of radiation to in turn translate that signal into electrons with specific features(due to it's own twists and turns) which in turn interact with the device in the headset which results in the sensory output we can ourselves interact with(light/sounds etc).

 in the quest some of this happens via software on the hard drive. the hard drive is something which contains particular grooves etc which is part of the process of translating electrons into sensory information.

anyway. each of the 12 channels in a usb could have their own wireless transmitter or receiver which each work in different channels(to prevent congestion of channels) which would allow us to overcome the data cap and congestion we see when we send usb data over wireless channels which are full.

Could i do this right away or am I currently aware of what these transmitters or receivers would contain physically.... no. As i said you have to follow a trial and error methodology of trying different matierals etc over a course of time to get what you need. Although i could educate myself in electronics and then i would have the ability to do this. 

My idea is sound!

Your understanding of basic physics is not! This is literally high school level physics.

the principles behind how to do this is actually also how all electronic tech works and your brain for that matter, the devices of tranlation are different is all. A power source and a whole lot of twists and turns and materials which ultimately end with the energy being translated into the sensory information which the physical features of your body such as the cones/rods in your eyes or the tympanic membrane in your ears can interact with. Think of keyboards/microphones etc as sensory input for computers etc.

IF you mean something else then please tell me?

if your understanding of how it works is different then please explain your thought process?

9895,Zetaphor,t2_6094z,"Counter-argument, Oculus is driving forward the industry by putting billions of dollars into developing new titles that without external funding would be considered too risky by studios and publishers (2.5 billion invested into original software in 2015 alone)

Additionally they're driving it forward by investing billions into R&amp;D and new software/hardware ventures that establish new industry standards for others to copy once the expensive exploratory work has been done.

Companies like Valve and HTC are producing hardware that caters to a niche group that is already part of a niche market. This in no way helps to drive mainstream consumer adoption, and therefore hinders competition and innovation. 

Until there are more paying customers nobody is going to have an interest in taking the risk and complications that come with hardware development, or the time and risk that come with developing software for such a limited market.",1573570348,f7bj9j3,t1_f7bi5fo,/r/oculus/comments/dv310l/carmack_awarded_vr_lifetime_achievement_not/f7bj9j3/,1,oculus,comment
9896,toastman42,t2_bjuki,"First, buy [Minecraft Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/). It's a different code-base than the Oculus Store version, which is based on Minecraft Bedrock Edition.  
  
Next, download[ Vivecraft](http://www.vivecraft.org/). It's a mod that adds VR support to Minecraft Java Edition. The Vivecraft implementation of VR is far superior to the official Minecraft VR edition from the Oculus Store. You would think a user-created mod would be clunkier than the official version, but it's the complete opposite. Minecraft Java Edition + Vivecraft mod for VR has better VR visuals, more VR options (including a range of different locomotion options), better VR controls, and better VR user-interface.  
  
Minecraft Java Edition also has robust mod support. So after you have Vivecraft installed, you can then download a shader mod like [Continuum](https://continuum.graphics/) that seriously boosts the visuals of Minecraft, and then get a texture pack that has cleaner or higher-res textures. I personally like [PureBDcraft](https://bdcraft.net/). It has a very clean, sharp, colorful, and slightly comic-bookish look, and it's available in a range of different resolutions.  
  
There are a ton of [shader mods](https://www.pcgamer.com/best-minecraft-shaders/) and [texture packs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs) for Minecraft Java Edition to customize the appearance to your taste. You can definitely turn Minecraft Java Edition into one of the [most gorgeous games on the market](https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images/2019/08/Minecraft-shaders-1.14-Chocapic13s-Shaders.png).  
  
Just a word of caution about that. Minecaft + VR + shaders + high-res textures can require a seriously high-end PC. IIRC, for my Vivecraft installation of Minecraft, I think I'm using [Chocapic's Shaders](http://shadersmods.com/chocapic13s-shaders-mod/) because it's free and it offers a variety of different performance versions. The Lite version will still get you a prettier sky and water without killing your framerate.",1573570494,f7bjgix,t1_f7b9yvt,/r/oculus/comments/dv30ef/my_heart_was_beating_out_of_my_chest/f7bjgix/,1,oculus,comment

9952,fraseyboo,t2_gr0yj,"Fallout 4 requires some pretty heavy modding to even be playable in VR, the DLC aren't included or supported (however can be modded in), there's random clipping of textures, the world scaling is borked (giant hands, heads dependant on the player scale) and it's otherwise an unremarkable experience.

Menu navigation is slightly better and it's kind of cool having a wrist mounted Pip-Boy however the gunplay is fairly lacking in VR (scopes blank the screen by default). The Fallout world isn't exactly pretty either, it's so much brown and grey that you get bored of the environment very quickly.

Skyrim on the other hand is pretty sweet, Dual wielding works fine and archery feels fairly realistic (albeit other games do this much better), magic works pretty well too. Melee feels pretty flat but that's the same in Fallout, the engine simply wasn't built with those kind of physics in mind. The world in Skyrim is more vibrant and the performance is substantially better, with a long list of mods it can look pretty spectacular too.",1573573946,f7bof79,t1_f79jas9,/r/oculus/comments/duu7fe/8_years_ago_i_never_would_have_guessed_i_would/f7bof79/,1,oculus,comment
