I spent a good 6ish hours getting project cars working decently enough, and it's pretty awesome. The rendered interiors are amazing, and the hud is pretty cool too. However, I think I'm just not the biggest fan of the gameplay of project cars. It's far too racing car focused for me (which makes sense as that was its goal). But, even after screwing with the difficulty settings and turning off rules and penalties it still just doesn't feel great to me. Either I'm way ahead of everyone, or I get behind and it feels like there is no possible way to catch up. So, I think what I really want is a game that is more like need for speed, or burnout paradise but with the beautifully rendered car interiors. Are there any games like that?

There is one issue, though, you can only play Vivecraft with google cardboard in Seated mode and not standing up mode. 

That kind of sucked because I don't like how the HUD is straight up over your arm and the mouse is just weird and you can't really use your headset to determine where you are looking and Standing Up mode just feels and looks better, but because of my super low budget, I might not be able to achieve that.

I did some research and found some driver application that allows people to use Wii Remotes as controllers, so maybe I could use standing up mode like that with Wii Motion Plus controllers but the application software costs quite alot, most people do not recommend using Wii Remotes as controllers and the free trial of it kind of sucks.

So I was wondering, is it possible to maybe change how Vivecraft works in Seated Mode so that whenever I move my head, the crosshair moves with the tracking of my head so that I don't have to move my mouse around to aim at where I want to break blocks? I mean, it seems kind of useless to be able to move your head around full 360 degrees, but not be able to aim where your cursor crosshair is.

I was also wondering if I could use Seated Mode whilst standing up so that I could feel more immersed by moving my head and body around whilst using some sort of joytokey software to bind controls to a controller for fun. Using the mouse to rotate myself doesn't really appeal to me.",Vive,How do I make Vivecraft Seated Mode feel more realistic?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/e3qw35/how_do_i_make_vivecraft_seated_mode_feel_more/,True,submission

I really like plane games, because planes are just cool. And generally they are combat ones like war thunder. But I want one that has an airplane, maybe 2 seater with a pilot and a gunner in the back like early ww2 american planes. Or maybe a full bomber with like 7 people in it, but ita not just where you are controlling everything like war thunder. It should be like star trek bridge crew, where one person controls everything. And maybe if theres not enough people switching positions.you have to fight off enemy aircraft, get bombs ready to drop, drop them and fly back safely. ( game would probably last like 20 or 30 mins like the submarine game, which is good but not exacly what I am looking for). And I dont want to stop at just aircraft. So for tanks they can have a driver, gunner/loader(being a loader would be boring unless its shared with the commander, maybe there is a loader which is a commander ane has a machine gun to use for AA or for ground troops.)

I just have a quick question regarding the placement of the lighthouses of the HTC VIVE, so the old ones, not the new ones.

I have this room ([https://imgur.com/a/SJuWX8T](https://imgur.com/a/SJuWX8T)) and want to place them bove on the wall where the dart board is placed. One in each corner. The wall is 4,10 meters wide, so they are probably about 1,90 to 2 meters apart when I put them up. Also the wall has a height of 2,60 meters and I am planning to put them up at around 2,40 meters. The direction I would mainly look while playing would be away from the wall, so facing towards the location of the picture taken.

Would this placement be possible with using the sync cable connected to both lighthouses?

They've both been working perfectly for months with little to no problems arising. However, a few days ago when I was trying to play beat saber, SteamVR kept crashing and so would Steam itself. After 3 or 4 tries, I restarted my computer and tried again. It still was acting a bit weird and took a long time to load, but eventually I got it to start up. Then last night I bought some new games, the seemingly problem one being sprint vector. I had my friends try it out and when they were selecting the character it kept getting errors saying ""out of memory"", which is weird because I have 16GB of ram in my computer. After it crashed twice we went back to beat saber. After about 20 minutes of playing, it randomly crashed my whole computer. We turned it back on and now every time I try to play it, it lasts about 3 minutes before crashing. My question is, what is the problem? My first guess would be the graphics card since it was refurbished, but the low memory error I keep getting makes me think it might be the ram. Below I have the specs to my computer. (I'm kinda hoping it's the graphics card so I can upgrade to an RTX)

I have an 8700K processor that is running at 4.8Ghz, but runs pretty hot at the moment at load, like high 80s, or low 90s, sometimes worse. I'm using the wireless adapter, and using FPS VR you can see that it does cap out my processor, not infrequently. 

So, the question for anyone who has tried is would it be worth delidding the processor, and maybe upgrading the cooler also? De-lidding would cost around $50 all told, and it looks like an upgraded cooler is more like $100. I definitely *could* spend that money, but it's not insignificant by any means. I'm guessing that doing both of these things would allow me to get up to around 5.2Ghz at slightly cooler temps than I'm at right now, as the cooler alone appears to give a 10-15c difference at load, and delidding is more like 15-20c, so that would be pretty significant together. 

How big of a difference would a 400Mhz be in terms of VR performance with the wireless adapter? If it's 1FPS, that's definitely not worth it to me.

I was considering buying the standard HTC Vive (£500) for Half Life: Alyx. I obviously will play other VR games too.

My Dad hates the idea of buying a VR headset that has already been out for 3-4 years and is utilsing ""older tech."" Although I see his point, I don't agree with him saying I should instead buy the ""newer tech"" such as the Steam Index for basically double the price (£900).

Can you outline the advantages and disadvantages around this? I understand the Steam Index has better resolution, refresh rate, fov over the Vive - however that's obviously to be expected for a newer product. I can afford the Steam Index but it is still very expensive.

As many of us have found out the hard way, those track pads will break the plastic housing and pop out (ripping the ribbon cable) with a solid crack against the wall at the wrong angle.

The only difference I've noticed in performing this operation several (4?) times now is that a) the Steam controller has only one fully smooth pad and b) the ribbon cable on the Steam controller is slightly longer than the native Vive wand cable, but still fits perfectly as a replacement.  Otherwise, the connector head, form factor, mount points and responsiveness are identical.  No glue, no nonsense.  Just swap the part and you're back in the game!

If your kids have VR Gorn parties, you will want a few of these ;)

I would always recommend pursuing warranty repairs if that is an option, but for most Vive owners, that is no longer the case.  You will of course need to watch a vid or two on carefully opening up your controllers and wands, but the operation is pretty straightforward, and doable with minimal experience if you have the right screwdriver.

With 4 boys and 2 VR rooms at my house, this has saved us a ton of money on repairs.  Highly recommended.  At $5 on sale right now, I suggest any Vive owner stock up and keep them in a closet as cheap spare parts!

Remember that each controller also comes with that magical Steam USB stick, so if you're upgrading to Index, you can use those dongles to pair your old wands as strap-on foot trackers...",Vive,PSA: The $5 Steam Controller can be harvested for parts to repair your Vive wands!,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/e2q1la/psa_the_5_steam_controller_can_be_harvested_for/,True,submission

So far I've only used them with the lab program as well as Pavlov VR since Pavlov is the main game that I play these days (close to 700 hours logged in it).  

It took about 30 minutes to get comfortable with the new mechanics, but once I did, holy crap.  Pavlov is really a very different game with the new controllers, and I'm guessing the same is probably true for other games as well.  

It's much better.  Way more immersive.  The main mechanic I had to learn was holding the gun.  The default position is an open hand as in normal life.  But if you do that in the game, you drop the gun (unlike with the wands where you hold onto the gun until you release them with a button click).  In order to hold onto the gun, you have to close your grip around the controller as you would close your grip around the grip of the gun.  Makes sense.  But the really cool thing is when you grip with the other hand as well.  You just grip your other controller as you would in real life.  No buttons.  It took some getting used to, but after I did, I found it much better, faster, and more intuitive.  

And then there's picking things up.  Medicine bottles, grenades.  Holstering, putting primary guns on your back.  Pavlov is a super great game, don't get me wrong, but there is quite a bit of room for improvement for interactivity.  Things are a little glitchy, but the new mechanics really got me thinking 'Man, this is incredibly realistic, more immersive, and in a way that really improves gameplay.'.  

I found that even within 30 minutes of getting used to the new controls, that I kinda had an advantage over the players who didn't have the Index controllers.  I noticed that the controllers were less in the way, and that I was more 'in the game'.  I could fire the pistols more easily and accurately, even the Barret.  But as I said, it improves the game play and the ability of the player to perform  in the game in the right way.  

Then there's flipping people off.  I'll be like 'hey, come here'  to a teammate.  I come over to him real close and then slowly and gingerly reveal my middle finger.  Its' really awesome.

A few months ago I moved and my new home office is a loft which is actually waaaay more spacious, except that the ceiling is a sharp slant downwards. One side of the room is a good 20ft tall, the other end is 4ft.

The vive trackers say a minimum height of 6.5ft above the ground is required, so I can't place a tracker at the 4ft side of the room...so my only option is to awkwardly place one in the middle of the ceiling slant and cut my play area in half.

I was really looking forward to the **Cosmos** because it seemed like a great upgrade to the Vive and with inside out tracking it would solve this issue. Unfortunately I've just not been impressed with the reviews or hardware, and unfortunately this room is pretty dark most of the day, which I hear doesn't work well for the Cosmos.

I've also heard the **Valve Index** base stations can track without a minimum height (even though they recommend 6ft - it can be used at any height, so my 4ft wall will be fine). That said, the $999 price tag on the index is just a bit steep...

I've been pretty amazed by what **Oculus** has done with the quest and quest link. Having a truly on-the-go VR headset and a PC one is something I thought was years away. That said, I'm worried about it being a visual downgrade even from the OG vive. If I am going to be spending $$ to buy something new, I'd like it to be an improved experience in some way. I'd love to hear if I'm wrong about though!

So, this is where I'm a bit stuck. I'm not sure what the best path forward is for VR right now in my space without spending a ton of money or downgrading the experience slightly.

So whenever i Want to play a VR Game i set up the Sensor boxes and plug in the Cable box thing and then plug in the Vive. But since 2 Weeks the LED only lights up in red. Now heres the deal: I checked the hdmi cable, used a different one, checked the Cables  and ports on the vive, checked the hdmi and usb ports on my computer and reinstalled Steam VR. Nothing helped. When I plug the vive in the light is giving me hope that i could use it, but nope. The Second i start steam VR it just changes to red telling me that i am a complete failure and dissappointment in life. Steam Vr then tells me that i am currently playing steam VR changes after 5 seconds to ""searching for your headset"" and then just goes ""steam VR couldnt detect any headset"" While this happens i hear the classic Windows ""device disconnected"" and ""device connected"" sounds multiple times... The onyl thing i could imagine is to check the USB cable. I am gonna order one now to check on later this day. But still i .. jsut feel like thats not the reason.

Does anybody know what else could be the reason and what else i could try?",Vive,My Vive's status LED only lights in red,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/e1qssm/my_vives_status_led_only_lights_in_red/,True,submission

Making a fresh post since I ended up buying a third lighthouse and most advice was on single base stations.*

I've been playing VR for a month with temporary placements at E, on the island between G and D (where the second chair is) and at C behind the couch. So far it's going good. Sometimes I'm losing track on my left controller (facing the TV) but that might be due to the how placement of my temporary locations of the lighthouses.


B and C are not that convenient to wire power to them due to the many windows on that wall. There is a power socket at the bottom between B and C but there is no drywall to the top unless I buy a really long extension cable for the 12V. There is a small pillar as part of the frame of the window but its not ideal.

**Thoughts and notes on individual positions**

D has a large lamp in that corner which would occlude several angles if I mount it in the deep corner. A potential alternative is on the same wall as D but on the corner between D and F, It could potentially have a larger viewing angle. Might still need to move the lamp though.

E seems like a solid choice that covers seating VR and the majority of movements for room-scale.

**My concrete ideas on placement with 3 lighthouses:**

- **E, A, D**: With ""A"" a couple of feet to the right to be more in the center of the room covering the back of the play area. E and D cover both from the front but might be redundant. Possible occlusion by spectators in front of A.
- **E, C, D**: A variation of the previous where I swap A and C. Having C in the corner above the window prevents reflections but also is guaranteed to no not have any occlusion issues. It would also allow me to mount E deeper in the corner above the desk making it a bit less visible and makes cable management easier.
- **F, A, N**: Where N is the corner right of the balcony between C and E. Don't need to move my lamp at all. F has a blind spot though.

for  some reason i cannot explain nor find a solution online , the mic on  the headset is always mutted. i have to press the umute button on the  headset to unmute.

Then i can hear  fine for a few minutes or less (it depends on the game) , then it mutes  again, then again i have to press unmute..... arghhhhhh

-Replaced the HDMI cable between the link box and my GPU

I've just moved in to a new flat (apartment) and it's substantially nicer than our old one where I could just about get away with having black wires running up the walls. My SO is (understandably) keen that we keep it looking pretty fancy, too, and all the walls are white. So basically I think this means I'm going to struggle to 'integrate' my Vive's lighthouses (mk.1) with this new place's decor.

As such, I'm trying to find a temporary method of having lighthouses in the living room space, but these also can't take up much floor space because there's, well, not much floor space to take up. **I've seen the tripod stands** that people use but those would take up so much floor space that my play space would be tiny, I think. 

My ideal solution would be something like a picture frame but with a tripod mount instead of a picture and subtle hooks on the walls to hang the frames on, but I wonder if there's another solution with repeatable 'zeroing' - maybe something with magnets? - so that I don't necessarily have to redo the SteamVR room setup every time I want to play.

Also, I know you're supposed to not have any reflective surfaces in your space but I'm just not going to take our art down every time I want to play something - is there a solution to that other than taking down the art every time I want to play something, or maybe some tricks with regards to positioning the lighthouses so that this matters less?

The problem is that once in a game, the entire screen goes red and steam vr gives the error -202, and says to make sure your headset is in fullscreen mode. The problem here is that the button to put it into fullscreen mode is unresponsive when clicked upon. I am truly down on my luck, and have been searching for hours for a solution to no avail.

\- Be super careful when you rest your headset backwards you don't bend your power or Vive Pro AIO cable! For whatever reason they though it was a good idea to use long straight cables, which you can easily push against and potentially damage.

\- The USB Power cable get hot! The USB A-A cable provided is absolute garbage and broke within a week for me, but yourself a thick A-A cable and be aware if it gets too hot it can cause your headset to disconnect.

\- 3rd party batteries are generally pretty decent, most 10k Mah batteries tend to get unreliable once they hit 25% - Either get two 10k batteries or one 20k. I personally run on 20k Mah batter taped to my headset which lasts around 8-9 hours.

\- You really need more than a quad core processor if you're going to run Wireless, it uses a lot of CPU. I run Vive Pro on an 8 core 5Ghz and VR idles around 34%. I would recommend either a 6 core or 5ghz quad core processor.

CPU - Intel i5-3570k Quad Core - 3.4 Ghz (LGA 1155)

RAM - 16 GB DDR3 2400/1600 240 pin

GPU - Geforce 1070

I have struggled convincing myself to upgrade, because my performance is still good, but I've had this system for a long, long time, so I know I should make the jump. Plus, after about 15 minutes in BoxVR something makes it slow down and stutter, so I'm pushing myself.

Anyhow, I've always been an Intel guy, but I don't care about the wireless adapter. Just thinking about my budget and wanting to not go crazy with it.

Any recommendations for a new rig? I don't want to go over... say... $350? If I can help it. I'm thinking maybe $120 for a mobo, $150 for a CPU, $80 for RAM. Gonna stick with my Geforce 1070, because it's never been a bottleneck yet. I don't really NEED to stay with Intel, so I've been looking at the Ryzen options as well.

Played in Medium and Hard (skip to 1:40)

This was the first time I got to stream this game on my channel and had a lot of fun in doing so. 

This game is certainly both amusing and a great work out

They have certainly taken a unique path into the rhythm genre in virtual reality and i think its going to have an amazing potential with the addition of more maps, walls and custom maps being created as we speak ;)

Note that, although my initial setup reads as correctly aligned (the red cone almost parallel to the green cone in the attached) that is no longer the case, as it suddenly shifts. This is approximately 30 degrees off of true measurement. The sensors are also at the corners of the play space.

And another question - I wear glasses, do have minus 3 vision it's called here, not sure of the measurement system in your country my dude. So is it possible to wear glasses and the vr helmet, or you can customise the lenses in the helmet so you'll have 100% vision. Hopefully it is so.

Comparing this with the VorpX injection, i'm blown away on this one just on it's out of the box nature to work well and not make me sick. It's unfortunate that it only gives you a set of guns, and a taster of the game (although the experience is still really good) because I want to play the whole game in VR. This mod is  geared towards usb racing wheel users, which is why I assume it was set up to be used with only one controller. What happened to this mod's progress? SOMEONE GET THIS GUY A JOB AT Rockstar. The story campaign would be playable (despite weird glitchy cut scene stuff) and also the game in general if both controllers were put to use. With one controller I have trouble aiming and continuing on a straight path. It feels weird compared to set ups like onward.  


Also, the [Grandtheftvr.com](https://Grandtheftvr.com) mod works without Vorpx using this Veryjos OpenVR alpha, my only gripe with that is that you can't shoot out of the car like in the veryjos version. Also my previous experience with this mod was using Vorpx, and it was severely sickening and low frames per second. Playing the [grandtheftvr.com](https://grandtheftvr.com) mod with the Veryjos injection is much much more playable, like native VR. I also like how the control scheme is set up, even if I have to use VoiceAttack to jump into and out of cars. I'm still working on my voice attack bindings, and i'm hoping to bind a lot of the switching character stuff, the thing about voice attack is figuring out how long each button needs to be pressed so it's been not working perfectly. That's my fault though, as i said.  


What's weird is that after launching the grandtheftvr mod with the numpad, I decided to hit L and launch the Veryjos mod, and to my surprise I had a gun in each hand and could shoot both of them. Only when I moved away I noticed that veryjos mod gun was dragging behind and pointing towards me instead of where the controller was pointing. It's totally unplayable like this just to mention.  


I was going to buy myself a usb racing wheel so that I could hopefully get that working with the grandtheftvr mod (with more mods). I know it works in the veryjos mod and i'll give that a go as well, but i'm looking to do the campaign. I think if shooting a gun out of your car was added to the grandtheftvr mod then it would be totally playable with voice attack no problem because it runs great and the VR view just gives you a weird perspective during cut scenes. and you can't see the map unless you system button out to desktop view. but yeah no gun in car and you can't shoot the folks during the boat highway chase, ect.   


Is it me or can you not shoot the gun out of the car in the grandtheftvr mod? Maybe since i'm not using vorpx i'm missing a function? idk. You decide. Let know in the comments below.

(any one of them would connected, but only the one, while the other two would always remain in perma blue light mode)

I tried switching the only functioning bluetooth dongle with a nonworking one on its (the one vive gives) hub thing.

that just made the only functioning one not work at all, just like the rest.

This is very weird and frustrating to me, because when i connected the dongles directly through usb without the hubs, it shows in the ""bluetooth and other devices"" that i have 3 connected ""Watchman dongle"" so clearly they work?

So then why do the trackers not connect to them no matter what i do and how much i pair, and only stay with the blue light on?

We had a blast talking to the people who checked it out, and I genuinely have friends that I met in GonzoVR that I'm closer to than my meatspace-friends.

It's certainly true that our user numbers were never very large, but in the end that wasn't the main issue. We always felt that the first priority was to create something that people really sustainably enjoyed, and once we had that we would then focus on getting more broadcasters and users. The big problem was that the kind of experience that everyone enjoyed the most: small broadcasts with 3-6 people, could never be economically valid for a broadcaster. We tried a few things to foster larger groups while still giving everyone a chance to talk, but there is only so much speaking time to be distributed. As soon as someone felt that they weren't contributing, they would leave.

We're making a new application now that builds off of what we've learned that people want, and the kinds of social groups that lead to the most enjoyable experiences.

I just ordered a cosmos online, however I wasn’t privy to all this backlash circulating online regarding controller tracking, lowlight sensitivity. 

To anyone who owns this product, how are you liking it? Is it plagued with problems as described by some tech reviewers on YouTube? Or is this just a common hallmark of inside out tracking? I’m curious if people using the riftS or quest have similar issues regarding the controller tracking. 

Kinda wondering if I made a mistake , on paper the device sounded amazing. Either way I have a 90day return period if it doesn’t meet my quality standards. 

I am upgrading from the Rift CV1, so I’m hoping to see a massive improvement *fingers crossed*

We are pleased to announce the demo for Dement is now available. 

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1022990/Dement/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1022990/Dement/)

&amp;#x200B;

What is Dement?

Dement is an open world survival horror game that has been in development for three years, and is available in early access now. Currently, the game has four of eight chapters, with most of the open world available. Throughout the early access period, we intend to pepper in new areas, weapons, and side quests while we continue to toil on getting the last four chapters done- and of course, fix any and all reported bugs. Purchase now and you will get access to ALL Dement content in the future, and be able to participate in the early access period. Suggestions are welcome; some have been made and already implemented!

&amp;#x200B;

Who is Paracytik Entertainment?

Paracytik Entertainment consists of mainly two people; one coder/designer and one writer. We hope to one day grow into something bigger, and to bring rich, fulfilling experiences to players everywhere. We want to be a part of a better gaming industry- one that focuses on games as art, moving stories, and engaging gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I expect from the demo?

The demo skips the prologue, and is the first three quarters or so of the first chapter on a 45 minute timer. The main menu, tutorial, and loading screens do not count towards the 45 minutes. If you die, half of the time since your last save will be returned to you. The first melee and ranged weapon will be provided immediately to speed up initial play. Expect to spend at least an hour playing this demo! If you get to ""The End of the Road"", tweet us a screenshot @paracytik for a congratulatory shout out! Good luck ;)

In your opinion, is it worth an upgrade from the OG HTC Vive headset? (I'll either sell it to a friend or keep it for multiple users) 

If you've played Beat Saber with it, any issues with the eye tracking? 

If you also use the Vive wireless adapter, were there any increase in latency or drops in performance?

Supposedly, foveated rendering reduces the work load on GPU's and CPU's, did you find that to be accurate? 

For those interested on the rig I'll be running it on:

Would 4 vive cosmos's work in this space? The issue then is I was planning to have a gun with vive tracker so then I am back to the original issue of tracking that, unless the cosmos can track vive trackers. I am also worried about how good the tracking would be with the Cosmos as well.

I am super excited at the prospect of getting rid of the Fresnel lenses as they are the main source of my complaints with VR as a whole. Note that I can't afford to just upgrade to a better system as of yet, so that's not really an option.

I am looking at all the details involved and everything seems easy enough, but I have a couple questions about the 3D printed adapter that will be needed.

1: Is this still the best option for Gear VR (2016) to OG Vive adapter? :  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804) 

2: If it is, which version would I be better off trying out, the fixed v3.3 or the adjustable v2.2 one?

Notes for 2: I do always use glasses with vive (as does my wife), but I don't know if it is necessary or even advised to go with the adjustable version. From the description, it appears that the maker still prefers the fixed version. I already feel like there's little to no room in the headset with my glasses and am hesitant to add anything extra in there.

3: Does the adjustable version need to be changed for each user, or is that a flat fix for the lens itself?

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone who has modded theirs and uses glasses can chime in, I would really appreciate a first hand accounting in regards to how the mod plays with glasses. Bonus points for anyone who shares the system with others with/without glasses to figure out how much of a pain changing settings are between users.

Salmi Games here. At the moment we are preparing for our next content update for our game [GrowRilla](https://store.steampowered.com/app/981880/GrowRilla_VR/). We don’t want to spoil anything just yet, but we have a [sneak peek](https://imgur.com/a/ZrJWkoM) of what you can expect.

With this update, we will raise the price of the game for the first time since we launched in Early Access a few months back. We’ve come to this decision after a lot of back and forth discussion internally, but in the end we feel $15/15€ price point more fairly reflects the value of our game than its original $10/10€.

The other thing we’ve tried to do (ever since our first VR game Late For Work) is to reward players who believed in us and took a chance on our games early in the process. If you supported us early, then you’ve gotten our games at their cheapest possible price. Thank you for your support! We appreciate everyone who’s tried one of our games, left a review or given us feedback.

So if you always wanted to buy the game (which you definitely did right) you can grab it now for $10/10€ or wait a week to get it for 15€! Think of it as a reverse sale.

Did we catch your attention even though you’ve never heard of our game before? You can find out more about our game [here](http://growrillagame.com/).

Thanks for reading. We are happy to answer any questions you may have in the comments.
