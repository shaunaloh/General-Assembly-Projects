97,Falandorn,t2_i27t2,"Hi sorry bloody reddit wouldn't let me link the slightly nicer imgur post I made so had to re-hash the one above to link it.

[Here is the imgur one anyway](https://imgur.com/gallery/cy3C6Z5)

So it's basically a design I wanted to make for years but didn't have the willpower or patience to follow it up.

Its a modular design and probably it's best feature is the wrap-around cage for the rear controller (which tends to suffer from slight occlusion in regular under-slung magnetic designs). This normally isn't a major issue unless you are very competitive and the slight movement irritates you on long range sniping.

I wanted to make a gunstock that was also realistic in appearance and handling, this one doubles as a nice centre-piece for a VR display but also has a great extra feature, a 5mW laser which is boremounted via an extra module. The magazine is not just for looks it houses the trigger for the laser which can be simply retro-fitted after purchase if needed. The trigger comes pre-installed just in case so will sit there redundant until required.

Using apps like LaserHIT and iTarget Pro on a mobile device you can setup indoor ranges and just plink away at home using the picatinny mount on the rifle to practice your accuracy and speed. This is especially fun with the Laser M16 front sight as lining up that post and peep sight aperture is worth practicing.

I am working on free-standing laser reactive targets [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJW2bq2cjo0&amp;t=287s) that will 'ping' a metal plate / bell when hit for long range accuracy, this is where the scope will come in handy. I am privately working on wearable targets too for a possible laser-target game as these lasers can thread the needle at 200 yards, its not like normal laser target guns that actually use IR instead of lasers for safety. Of course this is only for personal use and safety glasses would need to be worn if shooting at other persons, the Class IIIa laser is considered safe if used correctly and your blink-reflex will save damage to eyes but staring into it directly will cause damage, this drops off over distance. This system involves arduino circuits and will take a while to setup so its a long term project on the side. The Laser Module will ship separately and installing and using it is at buyers own risk, obviously it is impossible to control the safe use of units sold so this is the only option available.

The rifle itself works real nice in-game and the magnetic north / south controllers snap in self-guiding for the most. I added a magnetic pump-action attachment on the front mag well. Originally I was going to do two versions of the rifle but it seemed much better to throw on an attachment instead of making people choose different rifles.

This gunstock isn't really competing against anything else on the market because it was just a personal project I wanted to get over. If anyone else is interested you can pick one up on my eBay store [here](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Beowulf-VR-Carbine-HTC-Gamer-Pro-controller-gun-stock-mount-pump-action/223503173043?hash=item3409d3c5b3:m:mC1PqTw2BqttWpRE6imNmQQ) but they are not cheap at ¬£165 and would recommend anyone not buying one unless you have a desire to own something like this. It's definitely a functional stock that feels aesthetically realistic in-game but if performance is the only thing you are after then there are plenty of other cheaper stocks out there. I offer a budget range starting from ¬£35 that perform really well and are dirt cheap for instance.

This thing looks absolutely amazing though I really love just walking in the room and looking at it. When you strap this thing on to play Pavlov or Onward it feels like you are about to shoot for real like paintball or something like that, it transforms the experience to a different plain.

The gunstock ships with Index and HTC Vive wand attachments as standard so no need to specifiy when ordering. Its actually great to have as a controller-holder for the other set when not in-use although a ridiculous price if that's all it was used for :O)",1575206608,f9aux32,t3_e4h874,/r/Vive/comments/e4h874/beowulf_vr_carbine_my_latest_gunstock_design_o/f9aux32/,1,Vive,comment

137,HawX1492,t2_8lk1y,"1. You can change the barrier types for you chaperone in the menus so you down have the giant grid. 
2. I found that using USB 3.0 ports works better for the system. 
3. Read the manual about how your light houses link. If they dont have line of sight of each other you may need to use the link cable for them. 
4. Dont let your friends play super hot next to anything breakable, (And if you play Hotdog Horseshoes and Handgrenades and have a low ceiling, throw the grenades underhanded. punching  a glass lightshade and having it fall on you and shatter while you cant see it isnt fun) 
5. They make silicone protectors for your headset and controllers to protect from smacking things. (mine have survived windows, lightshades and desk punches.). 
6. If you look straight up or straight down you headset may lose tracking, its normal, you didnt break it. 
7. Your vive has a built in camera and it may set itself as your default camera for things like skype. It may also set its microphone as the default as well. 
8. The included audio connector for earbuds can be removed so it doesnt dangle around if you use a wireless headset. you just need to unplug it. ([how to remove](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MigWitzU_oE))
9. Make sure to set your pupilary distance using the knob on the headset, if things look blurry you may want to adjust it. 
10. In the vr menues in steam home you can change your avatar, light house shape, background, chaperone color and many other things. I use the portal cameras as my light house designs. Theres a lot of things you can customize.

That's the bulk of what I think would be helpful. Mainly the dont punch things and get some protectors for at least your controllers.",1575214711,f9bojxd,t3_e4if0x,/r/Vive/comments/e4if0x/getting_my_first_vr_headset_tomorrow_og_vive/f9bojxd/,4,Vive,comment

222,ForsenMousePad,t2_50w4o8p8,"if you are going to get one of these, given the price if you want some good double action practice it is great out of a 92, but for strikers and rifles you need to pull the slide/charging handle back each time which limits you practice to draw and fire (bullets have no rim so the extractor doesnt pull em out). Even with a 92 im limited to draw and fire because unless you are law enforcement lets be honest no one owns a double action only 92, and if you want to buy enough to fill a revolver (in my case a 627) i gotta buy 8 seperate 357 laser rounds or if you only buy 1 you have to reset the cylinder each time you shoot and the cheapest bullet that lasts is around 12$ each being around 100$ i got myself a used laser trainer that has simulated blowback instead for around 150, but this was a little while back and im guessing the bullet can be found cheaper.

Overall tho i would suggest laser training 100% because the dry fire practice with your actual gun, but if you want better dry fire practice and got an empty room, get an airsoft gun and setup some netting and steel plates and the ring you hear from hitting the target is too satisfying, while the laser training is more akin to indoor range training where you shoot your shots then walk up and check your phone to see your score.

edit- got my pricing messed up because i just bought a bunch of shit for cyber ""monday?"" (its sunday) the laser bullets are a bit pricier and if you are lucky can find them at a gunshow for around 30$ used but some shops will sell them for 50-60$ low end, and the better ones are closer to 100$ each, i also suggest if you are planing to use this for teaching or for a lot of use to get the ones with striker caps since they work through the striker hitting a foam pad instead of a plastic button. Again this plays into would you rather just buy a 22lr kit for 150$? or a laser trainer for 200 new that features blowback",1575230693,f9d6mhh,t1_f9cnxev,/r/Vive/comments/e4h874/beowulf_vr_carbine_my_latest_gunstock_design_o/f9d6mhh/,1,Vive,comment

**Espire 1: VR Operative Review**

*Final Verdict*

&gt;Espire 1: VR Operative is unquestionably the best expression of the stealth action genre we‚Äôve seen in VR yet. The small touches of polish go a long way towards selling the immersion and opening your mind to the creativity on display to complete missions and the inventive VR-focused mechanics make it a pleasure to play actively in a roomscale space. While a larger budget, more time, and overall more resources could have elevated Espire 1: VR Operative to the status of being a landmark VR game that pushes the boundaries and redefines the genre even further, it‚Äôs still extremely good and certainly worth playing.",1575082437,f94aqon,t1_f94062u,/r/Vive/comments/e3hdr7/espire_1_was_not_ready_for_release_nor_is_it/f94aqon/,1,Vive,comment

I got to admit I have yet to experience the VR fatigue I have so often read about long before buying in and my months after.  Typically, sessions run just as long as the batteries last on either my controllers (Vive Wands or Index Controllers depending on the game) or my 22 amp-hour battery for the Vive Wireless; effectively no less than 3.5 hours straight.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother and his daughters all frequently go for at least a couple of hours straight when they come over to play.  Both of my setups are Vive Pro wireless.  I mainly went wireless because Elite: Dangerous with a wired headset really, really sucks to me where standing and room scale are acceptable to me with a headset wire.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure where and by how much the Vive Pro and the OG differ in feel.  I never did more than about 30 minutes on the OG Vive in any session.

378,Unt4medGumyBear,t2_c4kfr,"Your scope is so limited. Samsung's odyssey launched at $500 and is using almost entirely borrowed software developed by microsoft. Let's compare the rift s and odyssey. Odyssey has 3 less cameras, a better screen by a moderate amount and was derived almost entirely from previous windows HMDs. Rift s launched at $400 is using its own software and hardware developed specifically for the rift and has more cameras for better tracking.

You're comparing an xbox 360 to a gaming pc and asking why the PC is overpriced. Yes vr is expensive right now but you're paying for the research and development, software and the luxury of being first.

379,cmdskp,t2_104ktm,"&gt; I think oculus is ripping people off and so is vive, pimax etc
 
 
BTW, Oculus ceased as a company over a year ago - there's now only Facebook Technologies Ltd.(see bottom of www.oculus.com).
 
 
Yes, there is a lot of overpricing going on.  Probably because of the small market size being more enthusiast led(and thus, likely considered more willing to pay high pricing).
 
 
To be honest, I think Valve intentionally want to raise the desire of VR, by psychology, because even cheaper VR isn't drawing people in.  People can't see how impressive 6DOF VR is without trying it, but they can see a high price tag and think: ""Wow, they must think that is really desirable!"" and thus, they then look at VR more seriously and either buy another cheaper VR system or work towards the higher priced one they now desire.",1575110604,f94ykft,t1_f94wc89,/r/Vive/comments/e3truu/if_odyssey_is_now_only_230_for_headset_and/f94ykft/,1,Vive,comment

I can't seem to figure this out. If I'm not mistaken, you can run up to 3 Vives using 3 Vive wireless units on one PC. So my question is can I use one Vive with a wireless unit and one wired through the linkbox through one PC?

The negative on WMR (compared to say, a vive) is reduced controller tracking in you periphery (or no tracking behind you).  On the up side it means no lamps or cameras to mount.

If you run out of tether, you can always get HDMI and USB 3.0 extensions, but there isn‚Äôt a wireless option.  Investigate active HDMI, or HDMI repeater couplers if you go this road (to stop signal degradation).

518,Postscop,t2_4ggkomjp,"You are right with the whole tracking and that. But really, what is ""An Intro to VR"" ?

I get that doing VR for the sake of VR is your point, but why not do VR for the sake of fun instead? VR Headsets can get expensive, and theres always a debate. Oculus Quest looks good, sounds cheap within the price, the Windows Mixed Reality also looks good. But you have to realise something

You need a good computer for most headsets, so if your PC is shit, just get an Oculus Quest, right? But what if your PC is good, or atleast, mid-range bare minimum. Well, you could just use an Oculus Rift, Vive and other expensive headsets, or  you could just use a phone with a gyroscope and some cheap cardboard and glass lens's to get a cheap first look and experience into VR. It may not be FULL VR, it might just be fun knowing that you can look around you and look at your minecraft builds as if they were real, as if you are there.

I probably would get a WMR headset if it had SteamVR compatible controllers that are compatible with Vivecraft that allow me to use standing up mode to hit trees with the controllers and not a button press. And if it is compatible with my pc.

If I am unable to get a WMR, maybe I will do some experimenting like an evil scientist and emulate VR controllers and start making minecraft mods that manipulate how the cursor crosshair works aswell as some HUD mods that make the hud more pleasant, like a transparent hud that becomes opaque at a certain event, and then maybe emulate some headset tracking aswell.

520,wescotte,t2_3pebz,"Yes, but I tend not to because Rec Room's performance tanks horribly in front of that mirror. Also, when actively looking at yourself you behave differently. Your movement in front of the mirror won't match your natural movements.

A specific example... When playing Shadow Point I'll often have my hands just down at my sides as I try and figure out a puzzle. Take a few steps forward and turn around and see floating controllers directly in front of me. They respond/rotate but they don't move. Eventually they'll teleport out of existence when hands get back into the tracked volume.

The first couple times it happened I didn't realize it was my own hands and was like WTF are those things. 

Rec Room probably has slightly more intelligence in how it handles tracking loss and just makes better assumptions.

527,IANvaderZIM,t2_2vu04mbk,"IMHO, VR is kind of an evolving hobby more than just ‚Äúa new screen to play games on‚Äù. I‚Äôm into sim racing/flying, so VR means building tactile controllers for everything (I can‚Äôt use a keyboard reliably with a headset on), so maybe that‚Äôs just my bias... however the VR space is evolving, and products are shifting frequently.
It won‚Äôt take long to want a longer cord, roof mount cord management, squishier facefoams, etc.  Never mind a racing wheel, different controllers, a gun (haha).  Heck I just bought a subpac as a poor mans haptic feedback vest.

So when I say ‚Äúintro to VR‚Äù I mean a tracked headset, and controllers. With that, and maybe an ex box controller there aren‚Äôt many games you won‚Äôt be able to try/enjoy.  Odd are it will leave you longing for more kit, or a better headset down the road.  Index supports finger tracking, other HMDs track hands behind the back, etc.
However, the resolution is right up there with the other upper crust headsets, and it comes with controllers that work just fine for 95% of games.  That‚Äôs all WMR.


I agree that you should get this google cardboard thing going, it‚Äôll just whet your appetite :)
My concern is makeshift controllers+hmd+3rd Party software+potential self mod= glitchy, frustrating gameplay, and a potential fan turned off VR.

If you‚Äôve got any disposable income (don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre 5, 15, or 50), I highly suggest a couple hundred bucks on a cheap headset (new WMR or used vive/oculus); especially since it‚Äôs rotating sales from today until about newyears. You‚Äôll be playing your game in fifteen minutes with no glitches, and no headache.

On the strong computer....sort of.  How old is your rig? VR isn‚Äôt that ‚Äònew‚Äô anymore.
What do you have for a video card? Basically anything 1060 and up should be fine.  I was on a 1070 for several years and no issues (played most everything on hi on an OG vive).
Don‚Äôt worry about your CPU either, I think 5th gen i5 was the suggested...

If you need a new PC to run the HMD, I get it, bad investment, go with a quest. I think it‚Äôs a bit pricier than the WMR though.
If you have a PC DO NOT buy the quest.  This is just my opinion, but there was a huge movement to keep Screen refresh rate at 90hz or higher (like the index), or else motion sickness and choppiness; yet the quest is capped at 72hz, which (to me) is junk.

Not familiar with the leap motion Orion, but I remember shopping for a leap motion something-or-other before, it taped to the front of your HMD and did hand tracking.  I wanted it for clickable cockpits in FSX, but I wound up just building a button box with arduino.

Perfect example of what I meant as ‚Äúintro to VR‚Äù though.  Even if you had a vive pro, within a month your like ‚Äúcan I get hand tracking for this? Is there some third party thing I could hack?‚Äù


Don‚Äôt worry, you aren‚Äôt being rude.  I‚Äôm suggesting dropping hundreds of dollars on a headset lol.

Your original post that started this conversation gave me the impression you didn't understand Quest tracking limitations. The phrasing ""for me"" specifically being what I felt was a poor argument.

I see we are on the same page now and we are simply describing those limitations differently. 

You saying it basically never breaks down because you don't notice it where I say it happens all the time and it's just not something, as a player, you notice often.

552,SkylerHatesAlice,t2_4djw6dh5,"Depends on how much you can get it for. I got my headset, stations, controllers and all the cables for ~$230 from Facebook for the HTC Vive. After it broke, the horrible experience I had with support and them returning a headset with more damage then it originally had, I just can't recommend them.

For ~$300 I think the Vive is worth it but the biggest drawbacks is 

1. Failure is something that can happen and then you'll be out however much you spent. If it's under warranty I was quoted at $270 to replace a chip in the motherboard.

2. You're gonna get bored of it. Certain people will buy it for the novelty and then never pick it up again because it's just easier to play a PC game. VR is cool, but you're still ""exercising"", moving around just stops being fun after awhile.

3. It's a novelty and will be for a long time. VR for all it is is extremely fascinating and an experience I am thankful to have had before I die. That being said, it's still a novelty and really I just use it to show off. My friends will be blown away but then the next time they're over they want nothing to do with it. It's just hard to put into words but after a while it just stops being VR and becomes ""more complicated video game"".",1575141966,f96a077,t1_f957ah6,/r/Vive/comments/e3vmz5/daily_updates_and_casual_conversation_november_30/f96a077/,1,Vive,comment

As you can see, some games will go into reprojection (like *Subnautica*) on max settings even with a RTX 2080 Ti.

This post is mainly to help people with Vives and their problems. We encounter many issues and mostly have to replace equipment when something goes wrong, but I hate seeing a bunch of posts online where people encounter problems that no one has answers to. I'll try my best to give my very best opinion and advice to help you guys out!

[OG Vive vs Vive Pro, which to get?](/r/Vive/comments/e45fd0/og_vive_vs_vive_pro_which_to_get/) by  AdorableMolasses


I'm unsure of which to get. I was originally going to get the OG vive, but since it's completely sold out on amazon/the htc site, I'd have to get it used from somewhere I couldn't return it if I needed to.

I've read a few poor things in reviews about the vive pro, such as the tracking is worse. Is this true, and either way, is Vive Pro worth it?

812,Ykearapronouncedikea,t2_25joc97d,"afaik It is out of production and they are selling off parts via certified pre-owned option.

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding at this point is the vive is partially discontinued at least in part due to part availability, as some of the components are no longer manufactured (the screen being the big one)

&amp;#x200B;

So what is going to happen?

&amp;#x200B;

HTC has a few steps forward.

&amp;#x200B;

The Vive Department only has a few cards to play, the pro, and the cosmos, and a new project.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on their situation There are only so many options.

&amp;#x200B;

They might be phasing out vive to release Vive 2, 2.0 tracking + increased resolution would be a minor increase in cost from OG vive and if they could hit the 500-700$ kit mark they would have a compelling product. This would also require relatively minimal tooling, and thus is a CHEAP option to implement.

&amp;#x200B;

They might try to prop up the cosmos. Both a major price cut or positioning it as better than the vive pro (and possibly vive pro decrease in cost) are both viable options that could yield benefits for minimal cost.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know enough about their costs and margins, so I expect more the latter option, but They are cash strapped so the move will be quick whatever it is..... It is also very important to note that they have been release-ing several VR products per year.... so it is a very viable option they have a vive 2 in the pipelines.....

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless its a bit up in the air and I don't know enough about Their business culture to make an overly educated guess.",1575006396,f91zd3o,t3_e3a9iz,/r/Vive/comments/e3a9iz/when_is_the_htc_vive_coming_back/f91zd3o/,1,Vive,comment

Just take of the headset and stop playing for a couple of minutes when the feeling arrives and you should get no long lasting motion sickness. Also, maybe in the beginning, take a rest every 10 minutes and check how you are feeling. You will notice if something feels off. Most games try to limit the motion sickness inducing mechanics so you should be fine.

The complaint I read a lot at the start was some thinking they wanted a joystick over touchpad.   I thought the worst controllers by reputation were things like the windows mixed reality but I suppose they are no longer on the market.  

People grew to dislike the vive controllers because they seemed weak in specific build areas such as the known touchpad breakages.  More recently, the hard to replace batteries is another dislike that is being felt.   They are way too expensive making it a painful thing to deal with.


A lot of noise was created against the vive controllers but to me it just seems like alternatives and the usual thing of people justifying their purchases.

As soon as you have any sort of VR sickness stop playing until it goes, people often say ginger beer/ale can help.

There are a very few people who never get over it, but the vast majority will find their play sessions get longer and longer until they no longer feel bad.

When you first get it try out some cockpit based games first (racing, flight space sims), they give you a fixed viewpoint and help minimise sickness, and build yourself up to a full locomotion FPS (which are the worst for bringing on the sickness).

As someone else mentioned almost every game comes with comfort options these days, so they'll default to teleport locomotion with snap turns and vignetting during movement, all of which help, but don't worry, soon enough you'll be able to turn it all off and enjoy the games however you want, sickness free!",1575022402,f92bhey,t3_e3ca63,/r/Vive/comments/e3ca63/how_common_is_motion_sickness/f92bhey/,1,Vive,comment

897,TizardPaperclip,t2_13xs8h1h,"&gt; Are games playable with the OG Vive are playable with the Vive Cosmos?

That is a logically untenable question. Think about it:

 1. If you've already bought games for the Vive, then you've already got the Vive, and therefore don't care whether the games are compatible with budget headsets.
 2. If you *haven't* already bought games for the Vive, then you have no reason to care what games made for the Vive are compatible with.

Either way, there's no way you should be asking that question. But the two untenable answers are:

 1. Do you already own a Vive? If so, it doesn't matter whether the games work with the Cosmos: You've already got the better version of the Cosmos.
 2. Do you *not* already own a Vive? If so, buy a Vive, and buy games for it. It won't matter whether the games work with the Cosmos: You'll already have the better version of the Cosmos.

900,andybak,t2_37rzg,"I think they are excellent for their intended purpose. Valve's vision was always to avoid ""gamey"" interactions - multiple button combinations, smooth locomotion via the gamepad etc.

When viewed in this context a lot of the design decisions make sense. The grip was always meant to be a toggle (I still think this was a mistake but you can see why the design makes more design in this light). 

The trackpad was intended to have multiple uses as you can see in the welcome tutorial. Valve always assumed teleport was the way forward due to VR sickness (and they might still be right - we are yet to get beyond niche adoption by enthusiasts who are prepared to ""get their VR legs"". That might not work for the next million).

Personally speaking I like the weight - especially in Beat Saber.

Touch pad locomotion, or any type of smooth transitional motion (like driving) will make you feel weird at first, that's a guarantee. Whether that feeling ever goes away depends on the person unfortunately.

Like others have said, you get used to it and build up a tolerance over time.

They are absolutely significantly worse than the Ocullus touch controllers and the knuckles. They aren't as immersive and aren't as well designed. I literally don't think there is one game where I'd prefer to use them.

So really I think it's just Vive owners trying to convince themselves they haven't been playing a gimped experience the last two years because everyone with a touch controller has been experiencing immersion and interaction pretty close to the knuckles (although not quite that level of immersion).",1575041006,f92t3zh,t1_f92bdfp,/r/Vive/comments/e3cm91/why_are_the_vive_wands_often_considered_to_be_the/f92t3zh/,1,Vive,comment

You'll run into a wall with some of the higher end games, though. On a flat screen, you're fine to play games that dip in framerate, but that's just not an option in VR for the most part.

For now, I'd dip my toe into VR with the laptop you've got and start saving up for an upgrade.

If you can sell the CV1 kit for some amount of money maybe it is worth it, but otherwise valve sells the V2 basestations for $150 each, and if you're getting the knuckles anyways you don't need the old vive wands, so you're basically paying $50 for a headset that isn't really any different (not counting the fact that the new basestations are arguably better).

If you use a thumbstick to move the camera and you fly around completley disregarding g forces it will build up in your system.   Some people can handle hours of it, some people can handle seconds.

This tolerance builds up pretty quickly though.


The other thing is pupil swim which is what people report with the gearvr mod. The lens arnt shaped right and ad you move your head from left to right focing on an object in the vr space youll see the world warp slightly as you move. 

This will also get you sick. 

Haveing a low spec VR system will also make you sick, any latency or stuttering low fps will definitely make you sick, no amount of tolerance build this up from what ive found.

Odyssey tracking sucks ass imo, but do not need base stations which seem to be a bigger deal with some people. Forget trying to use a bow in skyrim comfortably though. The tracking only covers where the camera sees. Steam VR base station tracking&gt;any other tracking method. 

Odyssey controllers use aa batteries and lose tracking constantly due to using the camera on the hmd.

1080,wescotte,t2_3pebz,"The most common reason a person gets sick in VR is from artificial locomotion. This is where what you see doesn't match your physical movements. Like if you play a first person shooter and you ""walk forward"" with the joystick but not in real life.

Now, it's more complicated than just move camera and get somebody sick. It depends on how you move the camera and how fast you move it. Some people are get sick faster and some are immune. There is a lot of research going into be able to do artificial locomotion and minimize the risk somebody gets sick from it.


You won't have to worry about this for HLA because Valve will not require you use artificial locomotion. There are other ways people get sick in VR (like the PC can't keep a steady frame rate) but for the most part we have solutions that make them a non issue for the vast majority of the population.

TL;DR: Unless you are incredibly unlucky I would not worry about getting sick in VR from HLA.

1101,Nazban24,t2_8sh32,"As someone who's tried Vive/Rift(S)/WMR/Index controllers and demoed the Vive/Rift/Index to lots of people, I would say the Vive does a really good job at interacting within VR space. It feels intuitive and is the easiest controllers to introduce people into VR. 

And for games like PavlovVR, the Vive controllers are the best for high level playing (according to my experience and many good/pro players I've played with). This isn't coming from someone who's trying to justify an old purchase. This is coming from someone who routinely swaps between Index/Vive controllers since both offer good experiences in their own ways. If I didn't care about the Vive wands I would've thrown them in the trash or sold them as soon as I got the Index.

If neither of those concern you, you want ease of setup, portability, and after testing you find the tracking difference to be negligible, go rift s.

* Simpler setup with just a single USB 3.0 cable and a DisplayPort cable.
* Much higher resolution display
* No sensor setup required
* Halo headstrap
* Integrated speakers

However, it does have these cons compared to the Vive:
* Small areas of lost controller tracking behind your head, although in practice it ""guesses"" correctly most of the time
* No upgrade path to the Index if you wanted to buy just the controllers down the line

[Issues with 4 index base stations and left index controller?](/r/Vive/comments/e3ot84/issues_with_4_index_base_stations_and_left_index/) by  PyPaw


Hello! Since I bought my index and attempted to use 4 base stations, the left controller would have fits for about 1-2 minutes of just flying off into space. This happens very often at like maybe every 15 to 20 minutes. It happens less often if I use 3 base stations and very rarely when I use only 2 base stations. Is something going on? Am I doing something wrong? I can't figure out why 4 would be the worst experience for me. All this said, this only affects my left index controller.

1147,Naddition_Reddit,t2_ls12r,"not sure what kind of customization you mean but:

you can  go on any planet and start building a base as if it were minecraft
underwater works too, even has parts specific for it 
you can customize your ship with different upgrades or add more inventory slots, but as far as i know it isnt ""customizable"" when it comes to  outward appearances
you can buy a space freighter (big ship for  your smaller ships) and even that can be built inside of as if it were  a mini portable base
and obviously you  can customize your character and get new mutitools

its kinda like space engineer in  the sense that its set in space and has base building elements but it does have some restrictions: you cant build in space
and you can make a ship from scratch like in space engineers

but, we just got a QOL update with the devs hinting that another big update is coming soon-ish

1271,PandemicSnowman,t2_dx3fk,"Index is the premium VR headset atm, and this is the priciest. Highest fov, resolution, and refresh rate, and it comes with the most cutting edge and immersive controllers to use in VR. But you'll also need a very recent GPU to avoid any issues with demanding games, a GTX 1070 at minimum. The Index is tethered to your PC by default, like the Vive.

Oculus has three headsets, and is targeted towards a more mainstream audience. They have a much lower price point, and the controllers have a good, comfortable design that works great in most VR titles. The CV1 is the oldest, so it has a noticable screen door effect, a limited fov, and requires 3 external sensors to get full 360 degree tracking. But it runs great and is comfortable to wear. The Quest and Rift S have inside out tracking and better resolution, so no external sensors are required, although the hand tracking behind you might not be as great. I'm not sure on that though. The Quest has a built in gpu so it can run some games without a PC, which is nice for ppl new to VR gaming, but what's cool is you can now tether it to a PC and have it work similarly to the CV1, so I think overall it's likely the best Oculus option atm that is affordable. 

The Vive is similar in a lot of ways to the cv1 specs wise. However it's bulkier and doesn't come with headphones. It does has some nice camera features, and the lighthouse tracking system is much more precise than Oculus sensors. Some people love the Vive wands, which are very durable, but I prefer the Knuckles or Touch controllers imo. If you start with a vive, you can mix and match components with the Index kit should you upgrade later.

Hope this helps!",1574908175,f8x4qau,t1_f8vj8y5,/r/Vive/comments/e2ff1q/daily_updates_and_casual_conversation_november_27/f8x4qau/,1,Vive,comment

I currently have a pre-ordered Cosmos and I would not recommend looking at one until it's tracking issues are resolved.  Otherwise, the Cosmos is a very nice headset.  It's easy to setup and works well with the Vive Cosmos Wireless Adapter kit.

1294,SemiActiveBotHoming,t2_13y9whqw,"&gt; I should reword: To enjoy all software you need to buy all headsets.

Given any one of those headsets will have more and better software than every headset would without exclusivity, even if you only buy one system you're still better off.

&gt; That's akin to having to buy all monitors to enjoy all software available on PC.

I'd be fine with that.

Naturally there's only going to be a couple of major platforms that will get the bulk of the exclusives, and I could just get a monitor from one of them that would let me play most games that'd be fine.

Obviously it's better if there's the same games but no exclusity, but in an environment where exclusives are viable you get more and better games from them existing.

&gt; Firstly, some of the highest rated and top selling  games in VR don't have a large budget.

Beat Saber is the only example I can think of here.

&gt; That's right, budget doesn't ensure something is good.

It does greatly increase the chance of that though, and dramatically increases the polish. Even if the core game is mediocre, a thick layer of polish still goes a long way - Defector is a good example of this.

&gt; Secondly, exclusivity and platform lock-in is not a prerequisite for big budget games; see Half-Life: Alyx, Elite Dangerous etc.

HL:A is a platform exclusive to SteamVR; given Valve's business model there is simply no advantage to making it an Index exclusvie. Just don't expect it to **ever** show up on the Oculus store, though. And it does certanly contribute to platform lock-in, with Steam/SteamVR being that platform.

Elite Dangerous is not primaraly a VR game; it's a game that exists independently and (IIRC) launched long, long before it's VR mode came out.

&gt; and triple A games

What AAA made-for-VR games are there on Steam? HL:A is the only example I can think of.

&gt; having not bought into the exclusivity-is-healthy propaganda you seem to have lapped up.

It has something to do with being a programmer, I understand how games get made and why money is important to this process, a resource that is sorely absent unless Oculus or Sony get out their checkbooks.

&gt; VR is bigger than gaming and greedy monopolising corporations

The world's biggest tech companies are (with rare exception) greeny monopolistic coporations.

&gt; and deserves better than the disgusting restrictive ideals of console and mobile.

... which are the only platforms they can hope to achieve widespread success.",1574919614,f8xi8er,t1_f8uzz8d,/r/Vive/comments/dzoj85/what_do_you_think_of_valvevives_future_in_headset/f8xi8er/,1,Vive,comment

I'm not sure how much HTC improved tracking since I returned (constant wobble of both hmd and controllers tracking, controllers were loosing tracking more often than WMR's 2 camera tracking setup), but even if they'll somehow manage to bring tracking quality to Rift S/Quest level, it won't be worth more than $500.",1574921185,f8xjud9,t3_e2pv2q,/r/Vive/comments/e2pv2q/never_used_vr_before_thinking_about_getting_a/f8xjud9/,1,Vive,comment

1339,elvissteinjr,t2_124yim,"I have never experienced this issue, but the simplest solution would be to disconnect your VR headset? SteamVR does not do a whole lot without any HMD connected, but it wouldn't fix it running to some extent of course.

You can also use a tool like Process Explorer to see the process hierarchy. You should be able to make out what launched the SteamVR processes. There's more to it than just vrserver.exe, but iirc it shouldn't automatically restart rather than go into an error state if a key process goes poof. SteamVR Home would be steamtours.exe, but this one does automatically restart if set as Home application.

Note that Steam launches SteamVR when you click the system button on the headset or controllers. VR-enabled web browsers may also launch SteamVR when some website asks for it even if you didn't want to.

There's also a pretty huge margin of error in terms of damage to headset even if you're super careful. These things are likely assembled in special clean-rooms, so unless you have one, you're likely going to get dust onto the other side of the lenses or on the screens.

1860,ciwolseyreadonly,t2_4sxvyr0k,"&gt; No you don't - just pick one with the most exclusives and buy that, and most people will get along fine like that. 

I should reword: To enjoy all software you need to buy all headsets. That's akin to having to buy all monitors to enjoy all software available on PC. If the idea of that doesn't disgust you then I'm not sure what else to say.

&gt; At the very least it's far better than *noone* having any big-budget games (which is more-or-less how things are with SteamVR, WMR, Daydream, and every other platform other than those of Oculus and Sony). 

Firstly, some of the highest rated and top selling  games in VR don't have a large budget. That's right, budget doesn't ensure something is good. Secondly, exclusivity and platform lock-in is not a prerequisite for big budget games; see Half-Life: Alyx, Elite Dangerous etc. With that myth dispelled, I'll value a platform that allows software to run across all headsets over one that creates artificial restrictions and feel great that I'm enjoying indie and triple A games alike having not bought into the exclusivity-is-healthy propaganda you seem to have lapped up.",1574853515,f8uzz8d,t1_f8ui7st,/r/Vive/comments/dzoj85/what_do_you_think_of_valvevives_future_in_headset/f8uzz8d/,1,Vive,comment

The Cosmos tracking is still very poor so I would avoid it for now.  I have one and it will be collecting a bit of dust while I wait for a Steam module to come out (1st qtr 2020) so I can use my base stations/controllers with it.

I was hoping to get a deluxe audio strap but they are disappearing and prices climbing... Close to what a full gen1 Vive are selling for.... (¬£120 cheapest I've seen.... From China.... With two month shipping..)

I have included a link for reference, I know they don't have audio, just looking for something easier to adjust for me and my boy.

1958,captroper,t2_fz8cv,"&gt; you're still stuck with the infamous Vive Wands.

Honestly, the vive wands aren't bad at all. I have the index controllers now, but the vive wands are (I would argue) still better than the WMR controllers at this point. 

&gt; but I really think the Vive is not a good choice anymore

I mean, I basically agree. The vive was a great headset when it was made. At this point, it is definitely lagging behind. But as I said, I think the controllers are fine, and more importantly getting the basestations is a big deal. I basically only advocate doing this if you can get it under $300 for the full package. 

&gt; The Rift S is a significantly better experience right now, even cheaper and new.

That's mostly true. The refresh rate being 72 isn't awesome, and if you have any IPD other than the average it's going to be way worse for you. Finally, the tracking is still better on the OG vive vs. the rift s. But, fundamentally I really don't like the idea of supporting oculus and their shitty policies. If you want to do that though, I'd suggest the quest over the rift s now that the link cable has been released. I hate to admit it, but I think the quest is a great headset at a great price point.",1574879858,f8vyn18,t1_f8vniz1,/r/Vive/comments/e2efij/new_to_vr_here_looking_to_get_a_vive_product_this/f8vyn18/,1,Vive,comment

1974,captroper,t2_fz8cv,"&gt; Rift S' refresh rate is 80Hz and I (as most people) don't notice a difference at all compared to the OG Vive or Rift which might be because the panel is lower persistence.

Fair enough, I didn't notice it either to be fair, but I also don't really notice re projection so I just figured I was a bad test case.  I still think it's going in the wrong direction, whereas the index is pushing it in the right direction but I understand. 

&gt; Why should somebody settle for the okayish Vive Wands when you can have the very good Touch controllers at a lower price point?

Honestly, I know i'm in the minority but I don't think the new touch controllers are all that much nicer than the vive wands. They are better for sure, but I think it comes down to the fact that we have a difference of opinion on the quality of the vive wands. I still find them entirely usable. To answer your question, because the tracking is better, and it is far more easily upgrade-able. And even with all of this, I wouldn't advocate the vive over the rift S if they were the same price. I'm saying to get the vive if you can get it used for under $300. 


&gt; Rift S' tracking is great and it's a better PCVR headset than Quest + Link.

I think the tracking is good. I would not say great. It's good for 90-95% of uses probably. But there are still things that it just doesn't do well at all that the OG vive got right. And it isn't just the behind the back stuff, I had issues aiming down the sights with two controllers in front of each other in pavlov for instance because they were occluding each other from the cameras. 

As to your point about the quest, that's true... but wireless is a HUGE benefit. And it's even better than the wireless on the vive pro where it's still tethered to the computer. You can keep your quest in the trunk of your car and play wherever. IDK, that just seems to me to be such a huge paradigm shift. 
&gt; When I get a give somebody buying advice I leave out all the politics as imo that's a personal choice.

I'm inclined to agree with this except I don't think it's only the politics of it that is the issue. It's that if you buy an oculus headset there is a chance that you will not be able to use your games in the future.

2019,danielfriesen,t2_mkdir,"&gt;buying the standard HTC Vive (¬£500)

Does this price include the Deluxe Audio Strap (DAS)?

The OG Vive without DAS can be very uncomfortable and cumbersome to use. Before I got the DAS I hated fumbling around with my headphones and IIRC it was even less comfortable to wear and adjust. That said even with the DAS I still have to deal with either nose or forehead pressure points that sometimes leave uncomfortable red marks on the bridge of my nose due to the hard plastic nose area. I can't wait till I get an Index with a partially padded nose and a proper integrated strap to see if my issues go away.

At the minimum you should probably be making the comparison of buying a HTC Vive + DAS vs. buying an Index. Because the Vive alone isn't a real comparison comfort wise, you are definitely going to want the DAS.

&gt;I understand the Steam Index has better resolution, refresh rate, fov over the Vive

It's not supposed to be just ""better"" in the ""128GB would let me fit more music, but my collection will probably fit fine in 64GB"" way. To my understanding the difference should be ""noticeable"".

I can tell you for certain that the Vive's limitations are noticeable even when you haven't tried any of the modern headsets yet.

Text is difficult to read unless it's right up close to your face. And if you focus just right, you can count the individual pixels used so make up a line and realize how much detail is missing from what you are looking at because there's only 1 pixel available for a detail that needs at least 3+ to be clear.

I've heard people say they can actually read text now at a reasonable distance on many of the new HMDs and I'm dying waiting for that.

The other thing you want to consider is that the Vive is discontinued and you're buying second hand hardware. HTC has terrible customer support and have denied warranty support for a design flaw that resulted in some people's Vives being bricked by sweat. Now it's discontinued and it's unlikely anything you buy will have warranty. If your Vive breaks due to an accident or the aforementioned design flaw, you may end up having to pay half that price just to get it repaired and be without your VR headset for weeks or months. Assuming of course they don't eventually shut down or scale back their repair services for a discontinued product.

That alone might be a good enough reason to buy a set of hardware you can get a RMA on from a customer friendly company.",1574888254,f8wdcgs,t3_e2jk6r,/r/Vive/comments/e2jk6r/is_the_htc_vive_still_worth_it_now_looking/f8wdcgs/,1,Vive,comment

2053,badillin,t2_5a12g,"The vive headset, wands and lighthouses are interchangeable with the index headset, controllers and lighthouses

So if you buy a used ogvive kit for say ~$350, you could buy the Index headset for $500 and essentially have the index experience minus the controllers... for ~$850


Then you could then buy the index controllers for $280, and have spent ~$1130 for the whole Valve index Experience (lighthouses v1 vs v2 dont offer any performance enhancements) so, you end up paying $130 more, BUT you start playing the instant you get your ogvive.

This is the route i took, i had the Ogvive for 2 years, bought the index headset, so the vive headset is repacked, the wands are still in daily use... but 6 months after getting the index headset i saved enough for the controllers and should arrive by christmas... 

You could also do bad math and consider that each v2 lighthouse is $150 by themselves.. if you bought the used Vive for $350, you effectively paid $50 for a working headset and wands, AND started playing vr immediatelly.

I prefer the Vive over the Rift, or Quest, but that‚Äôs just me.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get some downvotes for that. 

I picked up a Vive OG back in May.  Could‚Äôve waited longer and saved for an Index, but I‚Äôm one impatient fucker.  Anyway, I‚Äôm really glad I pulled the trigger when I did, and to go with the Vive.  Absolutely love it!  Been having a blast playing it, and I can always upgrade to the Index HMD and knuckles, later on.  Just jump in now and start having fun!

As far as all the noise about the SDE on the Vive, the first upgrade I did was to swap out the original lenses, and put in the Samsung Gear lenses, I grabbed off of eBay for like $20.
What a difference!  I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs going to look like the Index headset, but it‚Äôs a noticeable improvement, and a cheap one at that.

I also picked up a new TPCast wireless adapter on eBay for $155.  A little pricier upgrade, but at least you have the option to ‚Äúcut the cord‚Äù with the Vive.  To me, the biggest ‚Äúbuzz kill‚Äù that can ruin the VR experience, or make it less immersive, is constantly having to deal with the cable wrapping around your legs, and needing to stop play, or pause the game, to untangle it.",1574897073,f8wqbyo,t1_f8vt5y9,/r/Vive/comments/e2jk6r/is_the_htc_vive_still_worth_it_now_looking/f8wqbyo/,1,Vive,comment

2410,danielfriesen,t2_mkdir,"&gt;I'm going to use Windows 7 while browsing the Internet exclusively in a virtual machine,

I don't believe that's going to properly protect you. In order for a VM to connect to the internet generally the host (Win 7 in this case) needs to be connected to the internet. You are partially protecting yourself from viruses/malware that come in through the browser route. But the host is still vulnerable to things that come in by probing the network and taking advantage of unpatched security vulnerabilities in the network stack. i.e. you're still vulnerable if a new worm like WannaCry comes around. And because it's the host that is infected, the virtual hard drive the ""safe"" VM runs in will be vulnerable to any ransomware running on the Win 7 host.

You'll definitely want to either dual-boot or put the insecure OS inside the VM instead of making it the host.

Or preferably try and find a satisfactory solution amongst the other suggestions for ditching the EOL OS entirely.",1574769710,f8s5846,t1_f8rdki0,/r/Vive/comments/e1quhf/want_to_buy_a_vive_but_confused_by_it/f8s5846/,1,Vive,comment

VR makes it easy to create 3D animations whether one is an indie dev wanting to customize animation for their characters or a person who wants to create 3D animated cartoons.  The Vive trackers can be used in conjunction with software that creates this animation.

If you're looking to get them just to play games, there are a handful of games that support them, such as:

[Anyone tested KAT loco yet?](/r/Vive/comments/e1ylfn/anyone_tested_kat_loco_yet/) by  NeoID


I currently own a OG wireless Vive and love it, but I'm seriously prone to motion sickness so I have a hard time to play games that do not support teleport.

While browsing around on steam I suddenly found this gem: https://store.steampowered.com/app/798810/Natural_Locomotion/

I have tried it at it seems to work really well and helps tremendously with delaying my motion sickness (feet mode). Even though it supports the joycons (which I happen to own), using a phone as the third device wasn't working that well. I was planning on maybe investing in three vive trackers, but they are quite expensive...

Then I suddenly saw an ad on Facebook for KatVR Loco: https://katvr.com/products/kat-loco
These seems almost perfect; Small, half the price of three vive trackers and easy to use. However, I can't find any reviews on these, but I know they had a successful kickstarter campaign and wonder if anyone here has tested them?

I'm also a bit sceptical about the 1.5-2m range they claim in the manual.. does sound like a bit too limiting. My last concern is how this will compare with Natural Locomotion in terms of compatibility and support.

2519,scrabdogg,t2_36n0gxyy,"OK i guess i didnt play through the whole game over two weeks then, finishing on Sunday. Yes, I played through Garry's mod ,and yes, the entire HL2 Base campaign works - all scripted sequences etc. There are a lot of bugs, but I've already figured out the workarounds. 

The only major problem is that if you die, you have to reset at the beginning of that level - no saves. Not really a big problem because (with one exception) all the levels are relatively short. You will spawn with one extra clip for every weapon you would have found by that point, but no weapons you shouldn't have. 

If you never died, and had the time, you could play seamlessly through the entire game. That's not super realistic though, and (other than the fact that there is a lot of manual processes) reloading the level when you die is not a problem that should stop anyone.

Oh, and the reward for putting up with all the jank is only the best overall VR experience you can possibly have that is currently available, more or less.",1574790450,f8sw5nz,t1_f8spc3e,/r/Vive/comments/e1zac3/lots_of_new_faces_in_this_sub_probably_due_to/f8sw5nz/,1,Vive,comment

If you take the rambo approach, theres not much that will ever scare you. But honestly, isn't being terrified the point?

2704,drakfyre,t2_46apm,"So, first, I'm a huge Quest person so keep that in mind when reading this.  I have an OG Rift, PSVR, and Quest, and I basically only use my Quest at this point.

The Quest as a standalone VR device is unmatched and a bit magical.  You strap on the controllers, place it on your head, and you're in VR (or just one step away if you are in a room you don't normally play in; you just have to draw out your boundaries or set it to standing).  It actually remembers multiple rooms too so if you set up to play in one part of the house, and then another, it will allow you to switch between the two easily.  When you step out of your boundaries, your vision switches from VR to the passthrough video view.  You can also disable guardian completely and play in an unlimited size space if you have some space appropriate for that, but you can play basically anywhere that you can stand up and reach out with your arms and spin without touching anything.  It's got mic and multiplayer and 6dof and ports of many great PCVR games.

Tracking on the unit is [great](https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/dynrxs/testing_out_the_link_beta_and_liv_mr_seems_to_be/) but it's not going to match the fidelity of your Vive tracking in the center of your space.  But the only occlusion problems the Quest have are when your hands are very low or behind you; you never lose tracking accuracy as you move to the edge of your space, at any orientation.  It is sensitive to bright sunlight though, and can't be used in the dark.  What I mean by sunlight: if you have a big bay window and the sun is casting into it onto the carpet, super brightly, you are going to have trouble with hand tracking when the controllers are in front of that light, as they have little leds that can't compete with the sun.  It can't be used outside in bright sunlight but on cloudy days it works just fine, and works well if you have overhead cover in a large area.  Regarding dark, just a single light in your room is enough; it's not very picky.  But daytime indoors away from window is most optimal.

Now, for the Link portion.  Compared to Vive, you are going to notice a resolution bump.  You *may* notice compression artifacts when playing some games but you *are* going to notice the lag; there's about 2-3 frames between when I move my hand and I see my avatar hand move, about 1-2 frames between me moving my head horizontally and the world moving, and no percieved lag for head rotation (It's handled using asynchronous time warp which is similar to first-gen Vive reprojection).

It's also not quite done yet, so keep that in mind as I continue here.  Right now, it's not always perfectly easy like plug-it-in-and-it-works.  Sometimes I plug it in and it doesn't care.  And I have to restart it and then it works.  Sometimes I can just replug it again and it works.  Sometimes, when you are playing a game, it may disconnect or restart, or the link service may crash.

But when it's working, other than the aformentioned lag and the wire, it looks and plays very well.  And Oculus has had a good software track record regarding improving things over time.

That all said; I use Virtual Desktop to stream wirelessly more than I use Link.  It has a little more lag and a lot more compression artifacts (At least for me; I can't run slicing on my GPU properly which would help with that) but I still use it more because I can just play it wherever in my house, and I can spin and spin and spin and never pull my computer off my desk.

If what you were really looking for was the Cosmos, the Rift S may be what you actually want now.  The only real bad thing I have to say about it is I don't like that it has no IPD adjustment, and it's enough of a factor for me (71 IPD) that I don't really like using it.  But it's a really good PCVR system otherwise, has a similar tracking system to Quest and the same controllers, and it's got a good price.  It's going to be better for PCVR games in most respects than the Quest, other than portability and the wire in the case of Virtual Desktop.

So if you are still here after this wall of text:

**tl;dr** I recommend Quest if you think you can get something out of it's portability or playspace size capabilities.  If you don't think you, the Rift S is another affordable option if you have an average IPD.  Valve Index is great as a system but honestly the tracking system isn't all that much different than Vive and your room is still going to be non-optimal for it, but I have the least experience with Valve Index so please use other folks for index opinions.

If you have further questions I'd be happy to gab more; I kindof typed more than I wanted to and it's a bit of a shotgun pattern.",1574820058,f8u5u6f,t3_e287wp,/r/Vive/comments/e287wp/new_vr_oddly_shaped_spacea_bit_stumped_on_solution/f8u5u6f/,1,Vive,comment

2711,Maddog1929,t2_rhfpb,"The negative reviews for the Rift S are usually about the tracking being slightly worse than the previous rift, which inside out tracking will be, but its still very good so don't worry about it. The Rift S overall seems like it will be a better solution for you than a Vive with its base stations. However, before buying a Rift S, I would personally wait maybe an extra month just to see how the quest link cable situation turns out. 

If you are unaware, the quest link cable is a beta feature that allows the normally weaker stand-alone quest headset to be connected to a pc and run the higher end more intensive pcvr games. While there are obvious drawbacks at the moment, including controller latency and slight compression around your outer fov, comments from the developers hint that the quest is not running at peak performance and the final release of the link cable may be able to bring a near 1:1 vr experience compared with tethered headsets.

Meaning with the quest you get the full power of tethered gaming when linked, and completely portable vr (albeit lower quality vr) when un-linked for the same price as a rift s (which is limited to pc use only).

However this is all speculation and only waiting for the full release of this feature will reveal if this is actually possible. Of course, if you can't wait and wont feel buyers remorse if the quest turns out to be as good as it sounds.

Controller upgrade was 100% worth it. Having the finger tracking and the ""grip"" be closing and opening your hand instead of two buttons to squeeze has made a huge difference in any game I play.

I like to think of the headset being ""worth"" 300/500 of the price for me.
I LOVE having the built in speakers, so convenient and better sounding than I expected. Also great that I can hear if someone wants my attention and just raise them up.

The visuals are definitely better, partly because the headset is able to fit my head much cleaner than the vive. Someone else mentioned being careful about your specs and I think i might be experiencing that, some games aren't keeping up as well as they used to.

Hope this helps. I'm happy with upgrading both but the controllers are for sure the biggest impact",1574650212,f8nq9pk,t3_e10uk3,/r/Vive/comments/e10uk3/upgrading_to_the_index/f8nq9pk/,1,Vive,comment

2826,BeautifulType,t2_1y4ve31z,"I agree with all your points.

1. Most gamers prefer games with progression. They are far more popular than open ended sandbox games. The only exception is minecraft, but minecraft is sort of unique in that genre for how popular it is. When it comes to VR, since people expect to be able to interact and manipulate everything, you'd have to have a minecraft x100 times to achieve the same imagination immersion in VR. That being said, I can think of a bunch of games that can be ""sandboxish"" but also have goals and would be quite popular if implemented on VR or PC.
2. I think you identified the biggest weakness correctly, which is ""how much content is there on launch""? Its not actually reassuring that ""yeah there will be a sandbox mode"", which is basically an alternative to launching up H3 for some target practice. How well written is the story? Will it ever feel like you're part of the story or will it feel more like a killbox level where you move from A to B while killing stuff along the way?

I just hope this game isn't overhyped and people's expectations don't match what the game is like on release. Yeah its going to be in early access. And luckily they are launching ahead of HL:Alyx because god damn, if that game came out first they'd get rolled.

But now, no more touchpad-button that does not work and the fidelity of the screens is so much better! 

More pixels, better refresh rate. There are less blacks due to LCD instead of OLED screens and the godrays did not get any better, but overall I am happy.

Most people also forget to think about the audio upgrade the Index offers, especially if you have issues with heat and sweat while playing. You just cannot imagine how much it helps when your ears are not fully covered to exchange heat and not feel like being stuck in a full helmet.

The cable on the Index is also so much better than that of the Vive! It does not curl up internally, which was always a pain in the ass on the Vive.",1574667987,f8o8vs0,t3_e10uk3,/r/Vive/comments/e10uk3/upgrading_to_the_index/f8o8vs0/,1,Vive,comment

2923,Clawdius_Talonious,t2_hdlb2,"Honestly as someone who owns both a Quest and a Vive, I'd say a Quest is a better solution for a single VR setup. This is especially true if you have an Nvidia graphics card, with Quest Link letting you use the Quest tethered for Steam VR stuff and improved performance.   


A big part of what I love about VR is showing it to new people, and with the Quest you can do that in just a few minutes. The quest's portability is a huge factor, you can use it in much the same way you'd use any laptop for internet browsing on the go, and it has got to be the best portable Netflix et al viewing experience possible.

I love my Vive, but there are a lot more options that the Quest will continue to offer for longer, in my opinion, that make it a better buy than a ""I want something now and can't afford Index"" Cosmos. The Index will have a variety of additional improvements on either system, but the Quest will always be something you can drop down at a friend's house and have them playing Beat Saber in two minutes, and the initial tutorial ""First Steps"" from Oculus is a nice length for an introduction to VR after which people can be like ""That was neat"" or ""MORE, NOW!""

It's going to be a matter of personal preference I guess, but to me the Quest is the system that will continue to have merit even when you can afford an Index.",1574696996,f8p7mf3,t3_e0zjli,/r/Vive/comments/e0zjli/vr_headset_purchasing_advice/f8p7mf3/,1,Vive,comment

2955,RBridgeman,t2_11r6yu,"I have both the Rift and the Vive, and hands down the Vive wins for me. Im not a HTC fanboy, this is - incidentally my first HTC product - and is just my experience after owning both headsets and trying them side by side. There are lots of little things that win me over with the Vive. Hopefully i can explain the pros and cons to each.

I plan to soon upgrade to the Valve index, as it is the clear overall winner. However also has the price tag to match. In regards to HTC vs Oculus;

HTC Pros:

1. The sensors are wireless. The vive only needs 1 USB and 1 HDMI whereas the oculus needs 1 HDMI and 1 USB for the headset, and then an additional USB for EACH tracker in the space (Ideally you want 3 for 360 tracking to match the vive - 2 is workable though)
2. You only need 2 sensors (both included) for full room scale 360 VR
3. The Field of view on the Vive is much better, however the lenses on the oculus take the win, but that may be resolved with the GearVR lense mod which is in the post (Ill try remember to update this when iget them through)
4. The tracking seems more crisp and accurate on the Vive. The oculus (for me at least) have me restricted to a much smaller play space, and if i try push the sizing further, i get tracking issues (Oculus play space is barely long enough for both arms outstretched while stationary)
5. Its expandable! Yes yes, i know the Oculus can be expanded by adding more sensors, but not nearly to the extent of the vive. The great thing about the vive is the base stations and trackers are ""universal"" minus the oculus. Because they use SteamVR, you can look forward to new hardware such as the Pimax headset, or the Valve Knuckles. I don't believe these can be used with the oculus trackers or controllers (I may be wrong)
6. Less light bleed, i find that the oculus has much more light bleed into the headset itself, however i suspect thats only due to a dodgy face cover i have on the headset, so take this point with a pinch of salt. -- That said, there does seem to be much more bleed from the nose rest, where you can look down your nose, and clearly see out of the bottom of the headset. I cant do this on the vive.

However its not all positives with the Vive; and there are some points where the Oculus wins

1. The controllers are SIGNIFICANTLY better on the Oculus, they fit the hand nicer and they have some gesture support (select digits are actually tracked by pressure and proximity sensors) -- Note: The Valve knuckles for the Vive will soon match if not exceed this
2. The price. Yes, the oculus is cheaper, however from my experience, you can tell its cheaper. Both headsets are predominantly plastic but the oculus has a matte finish whereas the vive is a smooth finish, and so far, the matte, while looking nicer, has picked up more marks from less use.
3. The oculus comes with headphones built into the headset. The vive does get this option, but only with the addition of a ¬£100 headstrap which for me is a must have.
4. The 'sweet spot' for having the content in focus is much much bigger on the oculus. (again, i will update this when i get the GearVR lense mod, as this should resolve this) You position the headset on your head for comfort, rather than for clarity.

If all you care about is standing / seated VR experiences, (Golf VR, I expect you to die, Beat saber, etc) then the Oculus would probably take the win, as you wouldnt need a 3rd sensor for games like that; and the price couldnt be beaten.

However, if you wanted to experience room scale VR, or games where you may be required to be able to reach 360 degrees, you will probably be better going for the HTC Vive. The vive is just as good for standing games, however gives more flexibility when it comes to the kinds of experiences you can have in VR.

Both headsets have their pros and cons, however if you dont mind the extra investment, the vive gives a superior experience. However, dont touch the Vive Pro, unless you can snap up a refurbished set for ¬£500 on ebay. Ive also tried this, however the Field of view seemed much smaller for me. However Id like to give it another go now that im more comfortable with my vive, and how it rests.

TLDR; If you are on a budget and dont care for 360 tracking (You dont mind always facing your PC) then get the oculus with 2 trackers (2 are included when you get the Headset and Controller combo - Only 1 sensor if you get the controllers or headset individually) However, If you have a little more cash to get the best experience, go for the Vive.",1574702107,f8pik6q,t3_e1gu2l,/r/Vive/comments/e1gu2l/which_vrheadset_to_get/f8pik6q/,1,Vive,comment

There was one released recently. The Vive Cosmos, but the reviews are pretty bad and you should not buy it. Furthermore, I wouldn't trust HTC as a headset developer. The OG Vive was developed by Valve and just produced and sold by HTC. The HTC Vive Pro ist essentialy an overpriced Vive with a better display and a different strap-system and build in speakers.

If there was a wireless kit out now for the Index from Valve, at best it probably would only work with the 90hz refresh rate (since we know this is possible). Since the Index goes up to 144hz, they need something better than the currently wireless tech.

okay. Now, the valve index headset will blow you away... it‚Äôs litterally fucking amazing. 10x better than the vive. like wow... but it takes time to figure out the best fit. Make sure you watch the valve guide on how to fit it properly. the headset strap should be as low as possible on the back of your skull BUT SHOULD NOT touch your ears and stay just above. make sure to adjust the FOV knob so the lenses are as close as possible to your eyes BUT so that they don‚Äôt touch your face.. you‚Äôll see what I mean.

3051,jojon2se,t2_ihje3,"1. From original Vive? -Oh yes, I think so:

- Similar potential FOV, but easier to get positioned to make the most of it, for more people.

- A little less stereo overlap, though, and seeing all the way to the edges of the screens means that those edges will be there, within your FOV - not only near your nose, but in every direction - and hard to ignore.

- Better resolution, and full RGB, as opposed to the pentile: only-green-is-advertised-resolution-blue-and-red-is-only-71%-of-it.

- Black levels are worse, though, brightness lower, and colours less vibrant (the screens are LCD).

- Light scattering glare in the fresnel lenses is similar in intensity, but different in character: Kind of a hybrid between Vive and Rift CV1 -- like an oily film of liquid light, that slips across the lens...

- There is very little tolerance for having your eyes out of the sweet spots of the lenses, but when you do hit them, the image is fairly clear almost all the way out to the edges, This is the real strength of the index, and gives a much better sense of space.

3056,Costregar,t2_wnteg,"Well, looking at the downvoted reply this seems unpopular to say, but a 970 is most likely just sufficient to 'run' graphically more advanced titles. Even first generation Vive gains a lot in visuals with more gpu horsepower to put into supersampling and details settings. I never tried on a 970, but coming from a 980ti there's been a lot of improvement after upgrading. So I'd expect a min-specc 970 being a tremendous downer.

If you're at dipping your toes in with maybe loaned or a cheap used headset, or want to get going now on a less expensive setup, you likely can get on with your 970 for a start.

It came off more as a student's final project than an actual game. Janky, ugly and poorly implemented. 

And the price tag is just outrageous. Or was, anyway. 

Almost all games (excluding AAA) for VR fall between $10-20.. Orbus wants something like $60 for what amounts to a relatively ugly looking tech demo.

I'd love an MMORPG in VR, but sadly Orbus just ain't it.

If they had released it and asked for $15 or so, at least to start, it may have built a community. But I think they were banking on being ""the only VR MMORPG"" so people will pay what we tell them, kind of thing.

3153,phunkaeg,t2_7m3f4,"wow wow wow, this was so much better than I was expecting.

I'll give you my thoughts from memory as I played through.

1) No free locomontion was a bummer, I find that the visual paralax of moving through an environment adds a lot to the scale of the environment. And considering you have a flyable helicopter in the game ... could you please add an option for free locomotion? :)

2) The grip on the torch doesn't snap to your hand, which is an interesting take on torch handling. I can see why, considering that there are many types of motion controls these days, snapping to a particular angle could be uncomfortable for some controllers.

3) I dropped the torch once in a hard to reach place, I feel like this could benefit from either a) the torch, once in your inventory will reappear in your inventory when dropped, or b) you can pick it up telekinetically.

4) Graphics were very very good. In fact, the 2d nature of the graphic you're using in the marketing materials made me think this wouldn't be so realistic. The interior architecture was really well lit and designed, and the integration between the contemporary and the brutalist concrete was really well done.

5) I didn't know anything about Buzludzha except that I'd seen the monument in articles about old communist architecture. So I had no idea the state of disrepair that the place is currently in. When I got to the dark gallery, I felt incredibly sad. I didn't realise it was so far gone, as your experience shows it in such a wonder light. It did make me wish for a toggle to transition from your incredible unreal work to something like a photogrammetry scan of the crumbling decay of the real world Buzludzha monument.

6) You put fluid physics in the toilet faucets and soap dispensers that collide with the hand meshes? and made most drawers and doors interactable? Such attention to detail!

7) The torch reveals were a great feature. As mentioned above, i wish there was more of this transition between current and your ideal.

8) I really loved that I could go and see the Shipka Pass monument in the distance that was mentioned.

9) All up, it really made me want to go and experience this place, but when i realised how far the place has decayed in reality, it made me really sad. Then it also made me happy that your team has had the passion to create this experience to keep the place alive and perhaps even inspire convervation of places like this in the future...

Sorry for the rambling. I think I'm just going to copy paste this as my steam review too.

The shock test to the controller as well as your hand, probably disturbed an internal connection such as a wire adapter, or some other component, and since most micro chips are no longer socketed and are soldered directly to the pads, chances are the circuit board may have a crack in it, causing intermittent operation.

The only way to really know is to disassemble the controller if you can, and perform a visual inspection, which should reveal your problem. If you can accomplish that feat and you have the skill sets and tools, you may be able to correct the anomaly. If luck is with you the communications chip or some other chip is socketed and just needs to be reseated. You‚Äôve indicated a response, but rarely, that‚Äôs a plus, so just be very careful going forward if you do not have highly technical skills and tools, because you could further damage a situation that maybe repairable.

Comparing it to the $500 Index, you get OLED displays plus the options to add wireless, for $300 more. However you loose the high refresh rate and the OLED doesn't have the subpixel advantages of the Index. 
Plus the entire kit itself is $1600. I am not sure what this extra $600 is really getting you. Maybe if they through in the wireless to the kit but even then it is still over priced. 

When it first came out I felt it was way over priced, but they they had the best product on the market at the time so I couldn't really argue with them.

Personally I'm a fan of the trackpad for the Vive, for the simple reason that it's actually easier and smoother to do fine movement by rolling your thumb instead of shifting your entire thumb. Thumbsticks feel a little mechanical in comparison, although they have the benefit of having a fixed axis and not bumping them accidentally (and that will probably happen a lot with the trackpad).

However, I think you need to first consider where you want your actual play area to be, and also whether you want an irregular (non-rectangular) shape. Even if you get more overall play area, an irregular shape may be more of a hassle to deal with, since you can get awkwardly stuck in the corner. That cut-in between D and F is really unfortunate for optimizing play area. 

Basically if you want your play area to primarily be between the couch and the wall, then just do C,E,F and don't worry about losing a small amount of the kitchen.   


It looks like even if you push the couch back to the far wall you're not actually gaining much play area beyond where C is located, so location E doesn't actually do much for you.",1574582834,f8i1emw,t3_e0sosh,/r/Vive/comments/e0sosh/advice_on_lighthouse_placement_with_3_base/f8i1emw/,1,Vive,comment

3336,Dreamer8916,t2_3g14aeef,"For months I was asking myself the same question. And I made a decision I am more than happy with.

&amp;#x200B;

I could not try the indey yet but for me there is 1 main reason Vive Pro &gt; Index.

OLED

&amp;#x200B;

For more than 15 years I was searching for perfect picture quality. I had more than 20+ displays at home (TV, PC monitors, etc.) and there is no better display type than OLED. The ability to light every damn single pixel independently and till pure black gives you contrast that no other panel can match. This gives picture just so much more ""punch"" and depth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here¬¥s an example from a youtube comparison that shows exactly that:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sim-gFg\_lp0&amp;t=428s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sim-gFg_lp0&amp;t=428s)

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I did the Gear VR Lens Mod. I made sure that every surface of the ground and the lens is as flat as possible. This is extremly important as 3D printers often do not print 100% flat surfaces. I used  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2837804)  V3.3. and a Gear VR 323. I got 0% distortion and I did not need any modification file. I tried Arizone Sunshine, theBlu, TheLab, The Wizards, SteamVR Home, Onward, and many more. No distortion at all.

You lose a little FOV but now the combination of the OLED picture quality, almost no god rays (night and day difference), huge sweet spot (night and day difference) and clarity (night and day difference) is overwhelming. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to try the Index to see how much the high refresh rate impacts the experience but I can not imagine any better picture quality at the moment than Vive Pro with the Gear VR lens mod.

3339,a_gilling,t2_9ubp99,"Summary for those who dont want to watch the video.

As im sure alot of you are already aware Boneworks is coming on December the 10th and seems to be a game that people either think is the second coming of christ or just a tech demo.

I sit somewhere in the middle, I can see alot of good things with this game its doing differently and also have some concerns and in this video I am going to go over the reasons why I think people are so hyped for this game and add my concerns at the end.

**Inverse Kinematics** \- The first thing this is doing well is the Inverse Kinematics, Inverse Kinematics arent new, We are seeing more and more games ditch the floating hands and give you a full body in VR with mixed results. Boneworks seems to be one of the best I have seen. You can see in the video the way the wrist and hand position seems perfect.

(I explain what Inverse Kinematics is in the video but wont go into it here as im sure most know what it is)

Having an in game body rather than floating hands can really add to the immersion, as long as it isnt completely off compared to our real world body.

**Full Physics Body** \- Not only is the body visible in VR in boneworks but its actually a full physics body. This means your body, not just your hands or head can interact and influence the enviroment. (I show some examples of this in the video) In the past we have seen games rely on you having to use your hands to open doors or even only being able to open a door on a single contact point like the door handle.

Having a full body will make moving and interacting with the enviroment more natural and we have already seen this with Blade and Sorcery but you can still ghost objects through your body and arms which isnt possible in Boneworks (again I show examples of this in the video) 

**Physics everything** \- but it isnt just the body that is physics based. Everything is a phyics based object that reacts like it would in the real world. You cant ghost through walls or tables, Tables can be flipped. Objects have weight so heavier objects are harder to move around, this is done by adding a delay to your movements and the object moving which we have seen already in early VR games like robo recall. The developers at epic games added a slight delay to when you moved the shotguns to try to make them feel weighty, It was very subtle and worked really well and we are seeing this same thing applied more and more in games like Blade and Scorcery and the upcoming walking dead saints and sinners game.

This is exciting because it adds so many possibilitys to how the game can be played and we have already seen a strong community get behind blade and sorcery with people spending hours messing around in what is just a sandbox tech demo right now.

**Boneworks Engine** \- from my understanding Boneworks is using Unity for the graphics side of things but the physics engine, the inverse kinematics etc has all been made in house by stress level zero. This means they can potentially sell boneworks as a plugin for other developers to use so indie developers can make there own games with all the benefits of Boneworks but without having to spend the many many hours coding everything. This could open up the potential for a new wave of VR games with all of these features which has huge potential and is very exciting. There has been no word on this from the develpers though so it will be interesting to see how that side of things develops.

**Half life 2 vibes** \- Another reason this game is getting so much hype is due to the similarities to Half Life, the developers havent shyed away from half life being an influence on the game design even showing the iconic crowbar and gravity gun in previous videos. It has a look and feel of a Valve game and people have even speculated about this being a valve game in disguise.

**Node Video** \- I think the last reason this game has built up such a lot of excitment within the VR community is down to the Videos made by Node showcasing the game. They did a really good job with the way they showed the gameplay highlighting all the reasons previously mentioned why this game could be a big deal and the Boneworks videos have gone viral.

I dont think there is one thing boneworks is doing better than any single game I think its a combination of all of these things that make it look like a really big step forward in many different ways and I cant wait to play it in December.

There are some concerns for me personally though, Mainly the actual content of the game. They have confirmed its going to have a story describing it as a narrative VR action adventure but no word on how long it will take and have been a little evasive on the steam forums when asked simply stating it varys from person to person. I understand it will vary but some sort of ball park figure would be good. If the singleplayer story is short and most of the game is just a physics based sandbox it will lose alot of appeal for me.

I personally prefer a game with progression and dont enjoy open ended sandbox games much but judging by Blade and Sorcery I may be in the minority on that one. They also have removed the shadows from the game as you can see in the latest trailer (shown in the video). The earlier footage has shadows and they even commented on the lighting in previous videos so its a little dissapointing to see the visuals take a step back although not a deal breaker and I understand its due to performance reasons as they are already pushing the CPU hard due to all the physics. I think an option to turn them on would be good even if its in some sort of advanced settings menu.

Lastly I have heard rumours the game is launching in early access, this is a personal thing but I dont like playing games with a single player campaign that are in early access, I prefer to wait for them to be finished so I can play through the final version of the game.

And thats it, hopefully some people found this interesting and I would be interested to hear what other peoples thoughts are on the game, are you excited or do you think its just a glorified tech demo?",1574593914,f8iy13z,t3_e0x8m0,/r/Vive/comments/e0x8m0/summary_in_comments_boneworks_why_some_people_are/f8iy13z/,1,Vive,comment

3344,StanisLC,t2_xg70z,"Very good summary of your preferences and decision making. I'm still rocking my OG Vive and still love the colors of the OLED screen.
Over time I got DAS when released and went wireless meanwhile. 

The next thing I will need to update is my CPU, GPU and RAM next to a good Mainboard. This needs to come first before I will decide for another HMD. With all my equipment though the Vive Pro is the most rational and logical way to go afterwards.

Wireless is not just a gimmick. 
I got the Knuckles on release and they are really valuable and finger gesture tracking is a great thing but had to sell unfortunately because I'm left handed and am switching the controllers multiple times from one hand to another during a VR session. Another thing is my heald hand after it broke at spring time which somehow likes the wands more.

Yet big thanks to Valve for my HL.A gift! That's insane and I'm pretty sure it will bring VR finally the attraction it needs and deserves!

3426,_Schroeder,t2_jc46ial,"I need to clear to some things up. To call any part of Boneworks an engine is not accurate. Boneworks is made in Unity. Unity uses PhysX, a ""physics engine"", instead of writing it's own from scratch like a lot of engines do. Unreal also  uses the PhysX sdk.  


Yes SL0 put a ton of custom work into making the body, enemies, and item interactions but it is not an engine. They mentioned releasing an sdk/toolkit/asset, what have you a while ago but made it clear it wouldn't be until quite a while after boneworks was released if at all.  


Supporting a sdk like this wold be a ton of work. The people using the tools for boneworks are likely the ones who built them. Or at least have someone who built it in the chair next to them . Making the tool streamlined enough for an inexperienced solo developer could take a lot of time. Writing documentation and keeping it updated will take a lot of time. Answering support emails, recording tutorials, submitting builds for review, keeping it up to date with Unity etc will all take massive amounts of time. I'm pretty sure studios will want a good game under their belt before they expend the resources to support a toolkit.",1574613378,f8ko9bm,t3_e0x8m0,/r/Vive/comments/e0x8m0/summary_in_comments_boneworks_why_some_people_are/f8ko9bm/,1,Vive,comment
3427,rchiwawa,t2_1p1o5o88,"I have a couple of Vive Pro Wireless kits after just getting into the VR game  3 months ago, give or take.

&amp;#x200B;

First exposure was a friend with an OG Vive on wireless getting some seat time in Elite Dangerous.  He is the one who got me in and as a result we run the same HOTAS and have a similar setup.  Loved it.

&amp;#x200B;

Second friend hadn't mentioned but he came across a steal of a deal on a Dell Visor and I ended up putting a fair bit of time in on that Windows MR headset.  It's great.

&amp;#x200B;

I waited for a while after the Valve Index launched to see if they were going to announce any sort of wireless adapter as VR seated with the wire, turns out, is borderline unusable where standing and room scale its fine by me.  Since I play ED... wired simply wasn't an option so after I got tired of waiting for an INdex Wireless announcement I picked up a couple of Vive Pros + Wireless so me and the nieces and nephew could all play.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I recommend?  Take a long look at the Samsung Odyssey on sale right now from Amazon.   Amazon may be the devil in important ways but their return policy simplifies test drving out that set.  Although I haven't used it personally I know it to use the same displays as my Vive Pros at a fraction of the cost.  I personally have no problems with WIndows MR tracking in the likes of Beat Saber.  If it a little different and a little off of Lighthouse tracking?  Sure but it isn't going to ruin the experience and if you are unintiated you won't notice the difference is my guess.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are willing to spend some coin the Index is the other place where I would point you if wireless isn't a consideration.

&amp;#x200B;

HTC's support is legendarily shit.  Don't do the Cosmos unless you get some sort of iron-clad return ability and what you've read doesn't put you off of the idea.  My friend who exposed me to the OG Vive + wireless has one and he says it is fine (haven't tried it out personally) but does admit it bugs out infrequently.  There are a lot of anecdotes about problems and then there is that support I opened this paragraph off with the consider.

3450,captroper,t2_fz8cv,"I mean, the vive pro had real issues when it came out. Maybe you didn't get it at release so you didn't notice, but the sound issues that it had for like nearly a year were absolutely infuriating. It *still* does a stupid thing with turning on the controllers (which of course doesn't matter if you are using index controllers instead). Switching back and forth from wireless to wired is unnecessarily cumbersome. And the wireless doesn't work flawlessly unless you cool it, which means giving up the usb port. Oh, and all of the issues with the bandwidth while using the camera. I'll admit that the OG vive had that issue too, but I'd be surprised if the index does. 

But the real problem is the price. It is WAY overpriced.

3452,asdfffffdsa,t2_v96t2,"The physics engine is not developed in-house by Boneworks--they are using physx and as I understand it they have only made some minor changes to the actual physics engine.  At that level, it's more that they needed to have a very low level understanding of physx and rigid body dynamics across the entire team.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Not saying what they have done is a small feat.  Rather, my understand is that what they have been working on are physics based mechanics on a much more granular and general level, and in a way that's optimized for VR (for which it's particularly well suited and perhaps necessary due to VR's much higher fidelity interface to the virtual world).  To achieve this in a performant and physically stabile way has required a rethink and rewrite of many engine subsystems.  In addition, they needed to rethink how to approach gameplay design within this kind of system and minimize clunkiness.  
&amp;nbsp;  
By defining almost everything at a much more granular level (and generally across) the same physics simulation, it allows all of the interactions, the environment/objects, the AI, the player's virtual body, etc etc to behave in a physically consistent way, from which much more dynamic and interesting behaviors can emerge.  The end result is that one can use the affordances of VR to more naturally express their agency over a much larger space of potential interactivity.  This is as opposed to the typical flat game design where you're given a small set of preprogrammed interactions (e.g. quick time events) to play with, but anything that is not encompassed by those higher level interactions are inaccessible to you.

3506,Ryokukitsune,t2_b2nbd,"I live in an apartment so I feel your pain on the no wall damage policy. its stupid but when tenants go through the room every 1-3 years its also understandable.

i personally went with the cheapest solution I could when i set mine up. I read a bunch of people saying to avoid the adhesive strip solution but after having mine set up for 2+ years in this apartment I can say that it works so long as you know what you are doing.

the reason why 3m strips don't get a better recommendation from the community is because people use them wrong. the inside of the wall mounts is hollow so the strips themselves have nothing to stick to. I found a discarded corrugated plastic sign and cut it to size (a little bigger than the wall mounts) and then bought some nylon screws and bolts and used those to attach the wall mount to the piece of plastic. from there a set of 3 Velcro 3m strips mounts them securely to the wall. 

I opted for the Velcro strips so I could move a light house around if I wanted to. I play some driving games with my wheel and its less of a hassle to move a 1 lbs light house rather than an 20lbs chair (and cables and keyboard+mouse) so I just attach the light house to the wall over my monitor and reset the system to seated. another benefit of Velcro strips is that they are disposable enough you could buy a set if you ever wanted to take your vive somewhere and quickly mount it to a wall without the song and dance of finding something tall enough to rest the light house on.

hope this idea helps!",1574621731,f8lfjap,t3_e0tm4o,/r/Vive/comments/e0tm4o/temporaryeasily_movable_mounting_for_v1/f8lfjap/,1,Vive,comment
3507,_Schroeder,t2_jc46ial,"I don't see how taking longer is an indication of this being a tech demo. At all. Games take forever to make and even longer when they're doing something experimental. It stands to reason if they did successfully work all of the ""jumbled mess"" of mechanics into a full narrative campaign it would've taken much longer than just releasing the vertical slice sandbox mode. Which has already been confirmed for launch. If anything taking longer is an indication this isn't a tech demo.

Whether or not Boneworks campaign makes full use of the mechanics they've spent all this time working on is close to pure speculation. Claiming one way or the other doesn't really make sense. Of course Alyx looks way more impressive on the story side of things. But that's not to say Boneworks won't have a good narrative. What world would we live in if Boneworks had a better looking narrative than a new Half Life game? I'm hopeful but obviously there is a ton of skepticism that I think is way overblown at this point. I could be wrong but it seems pretty clear to me SL0 is trying to say as little as possible about the story.

[Is it possible to buy a Vive without the controllers?](/r/Vive/comments/e14nbu/is_it_possible_to_buy_a_vive_without_the/) by  cloudpersonn


Hi everyone! Been planning on taking the dive into VR recently, however I'm having some issues so far. What I'm looking at doing is buying a Vive headset, and then the Vive basestations, and then buy the Index controllers as I really, really want the full finger tracking support, however I can't find a Vive without the controllers anywhere. Can anyone give some suggestions or pointers?

3575,captroper,t2_fz8cv,"I'd consider buying a used original vive setup for like $250 or whatever you can find it for. That will get you basestations and controllers meaning that when you decide to take the $500 plunge on the index you won't need to spend the other $500. Or, you could get that full setup and grab the index controllers and still stay under the $580 that you'd spend on the cosmos or quest. Ultimately, those two devices *are* better in like 90% of ways than the OG vive, though the tracking on the vive is still better. However, if you have a beefy enough graphics card you can supersample the vive into being not much worse visually than the cosmos / quest. And ultimately, just getting in on steam vr tracking for cheap is going to allow you piecemeal upgrade to whatever you want in the future.",1574631601,f8mi244,t3_e0zjli,/r/Vive/comments/e0zjli/vr_headset_purchasing_advice/f8mi244/,1,Vive,comment

It may struggle with newer demanding games and will likely need to reproject frames even at lower settings although it will probably be OK for older/less demanding VR games.  It's also going to depend on what HMD you buy.  Don't pick a high resolution HMD like the Index.

3581,msuOrange,t2_vv2iuy,"I've just bought Valve Index while already owning the original Vive. Here's what I can tell:

1) Image is _definitely_ sharper and it makes a difference. You now can look into the distance and enjoy the view, rather than strain your eyes. I'm at last able to appreciate my fully modded Skyrim and I'm blown away.
2) It sits less firmly on the head, or you have to loosen upper strip a lot and tighten the back, which kinda makes your head hurt. And I don't want to sweat in it. So I decided to keep my original Vive for sport games and other more active/sweaty ones. Beat Saber/ Pistol Whip. Graphics is not so important for those ones.
3) Knuckles are so amazing. Not having to hold controllers is important. I also expected to be able to throw things better, but it is still kinda awkward.
4) That said, they wave reduced range of motion: because now controller movement = your hand movement. Before it was controller movement = hand movement +movement of controller in your hand. That makes a difference, again, in Beat Saber.

Overall, I would say that it's definitely worth it. Now playing any game I feel like I'm getting the full experience and don't have this thought in the back of my mind that I wish there just were more pixels.",1574632481,f8mldnv,t3_e10uk3,/r/Vive/comments/e10uk3/upgrading_to_the_index/f8mldnv/,3,Vive,comment

It's a bit annoying that you would have to choose between colours and effective resolution, but I think effective resolution makes a pretty big difference. Even without the extra pixels, supersampling makes a huge difference.

3611,Bradgt,t2_1ge07h1,"I to preorder Cosmos and own Rift cv1 3 sensors.  I am thinking about buying the wireless rig. 

I agree that tracking is getting better each update and I honestly dont have many problems once in game and everythings working.  I cant tell much of bad tracking. 

The headset fits me great and flip up is awesome.  Plus you can hit a button and activate the cameras which is awesome.  

Not having sensors and miles of cord on top of already miles of cords is awesome.

I just do not like the fact that exclusive titles and this crap sucks.  I have a hard time with Revive and usually have to wait for updates for new games.  Some of my Oculus titles dont work and some due.  Dirt 2 doesnt detect my steering wheel logitech and pedals.  Dealing with all the keybind is crazy.  Plus I have to keep Oculus open or atleast installed and updated.  Just a mess imo.

But Cosmos is not all that bad as a headset guys. Just wish things was differant or officially compatible with official support.  Without Revive which some dude made then why even buy anything other then Oculus?",1574635570,f8mv7hd,t1_f7gjx60,/r/Vive/comments/dw3pno/just_ordered_vive_cosmos_just_read_the_complaints/f8mv7hd/,1,Vive,comment
3612,Liam2349,t2_h62v4,"You probably pulled out the internal ribbon cable that connects the tracking sensors to the controller. I've done it three times on GORN. You need to take the controller apart and reconnect the ribbon cable, then click and screw it all back together.

Be careful and take it slow. If you are too hasty, you might snap off a sensor or rip a cable somewhere. Watch a teardown video before doing it. Try ifixit.

It should be the thick two-part ribbon cable in this image, next to the right index finger.

I'll put it like this: **If** you have the PC strong enough to take advantage of 120 Hz, and **if** you can afford to upgrade both headset and the controllers together, then yes - this is worth it. The combination of greatly improved resolution (seriously, it's almost night and day from the Vive) with the increased immersion of the controllers gets you very close to what we all hope for in next generation VR tech.

I don't believe upgrading just the controllers or just the headseat is quite worth it, though. On their own, they're incremental upgrades that are nice, but probably something you could wait longer for.

I always thought the joystick would solve a lot of motion sickness .. ie if you get sick from the slide motion bs your ears that just takes getting used to. But the devs never do the slide movement right - they make it relative to center of the pad instead of centering where you first touch that moment. So if your thumb lands a little off, theres no deadzone.. you lurch forward or back. Puke city for me.

Also, when you tried to use your sync cable did you properly switch your base stations to A and B mode instead of B and C?

Typically the gray flashes are caused by something in your play space reflecting your base stations. So if you have any mirrors, windows, or shiny surfaces you might want cover them.

3816,Nagorak,t2_z10ui,"If you noticed a problem after going wireless then the CPU is the problem, not the GPU. The CPU is not able to keep up with the compression workload. The reason you are probably seeing pulsating blurriness is because the CPU didn't manage to compress the frame in time and you ended up with a blurry partially pixilated frame. 

However another thing that can cause that is poor signal strength between the transmitter and the wireless receiver. Make sure you mount the transmitter above your playspace, angled down. HTC's instructions to attach it to your monitor is very bad advice. So, I'd certainly look into that as well.

Assuming it's the first problem though, the fix is to get a faster CPU. Technically a faster GPU will also slightly improve things, because if the GPU finishes the frame faster it allows more time for the CPU to compress. Likewise lowering super sampling can help for the same reason. But in the end the CPU is the major problem of not being able to keep up with the compression.",1574488505,f8dfdai,t3_e052j5,/r/Vive/comments/e052j5/graphics_card_upgrade_to_wireless_vive_question/f8dfdai/,1,Vive,comment

The complete opposite for is true for vr. Almost every game feels new and interesting just from the feeling of being somewhere new each time, and then there are the mechanics which are all fresh in vr.
I've been playing for the last two and a half years and I'm still not bored but am always excited thinking of what's next and how fast it is developing.

VR is what brought back the excitement for games. Partly, because it almost don't feel like you are playing ""games"". You are performing actions while being transported in another world. Think of real life games like Paintball or Escape Rooms. It's pretty similar. You know nothing can really happen to you and you are safe, but the immersion and fun are great. And it's very physical.

I'm definitely like that now, but I kind of regret it.  I was never ""Motion sick"", but when I first started using VR I could lose my balance if the ground under me suddenly shifted.  Back then VR was insanely immersive to me, it felt real.

But once I had a bunch of experiences where I had to resist that feeling of losing balance, and reaffirm to myself that I wasn't moving, the immersion was destroyed, I increasingly felt more and more like I had screens strapped to my face.

I disagree about getting vr legs being a bad thing though. It allows you to do things you never could have before.

Check the list on [this page](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Glossary:VorpX) and look for games that support DirectVR.  Those are why you need vorpx.  The app has improved from feeling hacky to ‚Äòholy crap how is this possible‚Äô.  Bioshock VR is one of the best gaming experiences I‚Äôve had in my life.  

My recommendation is to set horizontal turning sensitivity high to mimic flick turning.  Helps a lot with motion sickness.  The only challenge with these conversions is having the stomach for 100% smooth movement.  Certain parts of games may test you.  Like crouch-walking in Bioshock has a head wobble which is uncomfortable so I minimize that.

I have the same issue as you.  I don't think it's temperature related.  I've never be able to improve the situation.

What I have noticed is that in seated games (like Elite Dangerous or Project Cars), I never get the disconnects after extended sessions.  It just seems to happen in standing games.

My two theories are:

 1) Moving around a lot increases data use and strain on the signal, which can cause it to drop out with the gray screen crashes.

 2) Since we have the same CPU and MOBO, perhaps there's a limit with USB bandwidth or PCI-E lane bandwidth that eventually causes a crash?",1574525667,f8edxsc,t3_e0hp85,/r/Vive/comments/e0hp85/vive_pro_wireless_gray_screens/f8edxsc/,1,Vive,comment

Basically I'm using an original Vive and just recently I've been getting horribly distorted audio through both the Vive headset and any other audio device I try while VR is running.

The weird thing is, the audio actually starts off fine, but after a minute or two, it becomes horribly distorted to the point it's pretty much unbearable to listen to. I've unplugged and replugged in the setup, uninstalled and reinstalled Steam VR, etc. and the problem is still present.

4272,Nagorak,t2_z10ui,"My suggestions: 

CPU: [Ryzen 3600](https://www.newegg.com/amd-ryzen-5-3600/p/N82E16819113569?Description=ryzen%203600&amp;cm_re=ryzen_3600-_-19-113-569-_-Product) \- In my opinion the 3600 is worth a little bit more money. However, if you absolutely can't swing it, then go with the 2600 instead of the 2600X. The 2600 should be on sale for around $115 or so. 

Board: [MSI Tomahawk Max](https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16813144267) \- Don't have firsthand experience with this board, but it seems to be well respected. 

Memory: Two options:  [Crucial Ballistix Sport LT](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MGPK7XC) \- Can be overclocked fairly easily to 3600 CL16. However, an alternative would be to grab [Team Dark Pro 3200 CL14](https://www.newegg.com/team-16gb-288-pin-ddr4-sdram/p/N82E16820313712?Description=team%20dark%20pro&amp;cm_re=team_dark_pro-_-20-313-712-_-Product). It will also do at least 3600 CL16 but it will be a little bit faster than the Ballistix due to tighter subtimings, but most importantly overclocking it will be more straightforward since you can take the values straight from [Ryzen DRAM Calculator](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/ryzen-dram-calculator/).  

For only $30 more I'd go for the Team Dark Pro personally, especially if you don't have much experience with memory overclocking. It will be less of a hassle to get working at good settings, and memory speed makes a substantial difference in Ryzen performance. However with the 3600 that puts the budget at more like $420 at current prices (maybe the CPU will be cheaper on Black Friday?). If you drop down to the 2600 that puts you back under budget, but you're giving up probably 20% performance. 

Wireless adapter works fine on Ryzen now.",1574390058,f8a7whw,t3_dymxa4,/r/Vive/comments/dymxa4/upgrading_pc_on_black_friday_recommendations/f8a7whw/,1,Vive,comment

4332,silitbang6000,t2_12pwap,"I don't believe any VR service works over the cloud currently? All headsets currently (except quest) require they be connected to a very powerful PC in close proximity. The quest computes everything on the headset at a reduced fidelity and thus requires no cables.

Also I think your numbers are wrong. The TPCast supposedly introduces a latency of sub 2ms while the HTC wireless adapter apparently introduces a sub 7ms latency and wired latency is less than both of these. Depending on what frequency you want the whole VR experience to be running at you're gonna need the overall round trip to be sub 11ms for 90 fps, 16ms for 60fps (or 60ms if you want to run at 15 fps and throw up).

This round trip includes:
- sensors detecting and computing controller + headset POSEs
- sending this data to your PC
- processing this and rendering the game
- sending the response image to the headset

While 5g is impressive I almost guarentee advertised sub 10ms latencies have been calculated between an optimally located device and a 5g tower. There are however many factors that will push you further and further away from any advertised latency (e.g. network routing, signal strength, network load, distance to travel etc). At the end of the day 5g is just a fast way to connect your phone to a wired network because wired networks are still much  faster than 5g. So if we can't achieve cloud computed VR with a completely wired solution then there is no hope for a completely wireless one.",1574406285,f8aq0yl,t1_f89i3xx,/r/Vive/comments/dzoj85/what_do_you_think_of_valvevives_future_in_headset/f8aq0yl/,1,Vive,comment

4386,smells_like_wee,t2_31013mib,"Having spent quite a lot of time working to un-distort these lenses I can see why we see Fresnel lenses are being used. The main advantage being they are much more forgiving with location and how you wear the headset and the shape of your face, position of your eyes etc. and have more consistent distortion across them. 

Of course the down side is small sweetspot, lack of clarity, and light refraction from the Fresnel grooves.  But if your making a mainstream headset then these tradeoffs are better for the majority vs customers spewing up because of distortion effects.

While these lenses like the Gear VR lens are much clearer, getting the exact headset placement, to within a couple of mm is fairly critical to get a pleasant result. It also seems nigh impossible to get rid of both barrel distortion and pupillary swim  across the entire lens. 

Barrel distortion is to keep straight lines straight, and not curved, and also to not curve as you move change angle and the straight line moves through the entirety of the lens.  While pupillary swim is areas of the image stretching or compressing in places where its not supposed to. Overall it seems a better experience to eliminate the swim more so than the distortion. As long as the bits of image seem to end up where your brain expects them do and not float about then it seems ok with sometimes things being a bit curved.

If placement is off or you are sensitive to one more than the other then the result may indeed seem off, your brain will also be working much harder to reassemble the images its being fed and you will quickly get eye fatigue or experience nausea.

Of course I seem to have run into the limit of what my brain, eyes and face can do, and I am being highly critical. At this point in game no troubling effects are noticeable unless I really go out of my way to look for them. I wouldn't say its 100% (maybe its 98% there) yet and someone with better understanding of the calibration system may be able to do a better job of yet.",1574426949,f8b4tpd,t1_f893dvq,/r/Vive/comments/dzllce/htc_vive_lens_adaptor_bobovr_z6_lens_43mm_lens/f8b4tpd/,1,Vive,comment

Fitting the hand straps is a little weird. You want to use the top adjustment to get the angle in your hand right, then the tightness should be a lot loser than I first expected. They stick to my hands quite well with minimal fuss. My hands seem to be very average, if you have very large, very small or just differently shaped hands they may not fit you as well.

Some older games don't work very well with them just because of the angle of the controllers in your hand. Beat saber is the biggest offender here, it works, but just does not feel as saber like as the wands. Other games need a little work to remap the controls to something that makes sense. (Skyrim VR default controls are completely unplayable)

The finger tracking is still kind of a gimmick, but fairly accurate, especially compared to oculous. Squeeze to grab things does feel very natural once you get the pressure set up right. The angle for shooting games is good as long as you have the top of the hand straps in the right position.",1574435065,f8bepcs,t3_e0098m,/r/Vive/comments/e0098m/are_the_index_controllers_worth_it/f8bepcs/,1,Vive,comment

4497,captroper,t2_fz8cv,"I think so, but I'm biased in that VR is the one area in my life where I really spend money on myself. The cool-ness of being able to let go alone is pretty huge for me. The finger-tracking is, I think, a little oversold at this point. The reality is that there aren't any games yet that are using it in a hugely substantive way, and I think that games in the near future will also avoid it due to not wanting to segment the market. 

To be sure, games have it to look cool, but I can't think of anything other than the experience made by cloudhead specifically for the controllers (or moondust) that are creating actual features specifically for the controllers. The joystick is a nice addition for people who like sliding locomotion, and the trackpad is still kinda there if you don't. It's hard to really oversell the difference that being able to let go makes mentally though. Even apart from the obvious differences in throwing things for instance, it really is a pretty game-changing dynamic. And unlike magic leap for instance, you're still getting haptic feedback and a physical object to grab when you grab things. My favorite example is holding a bolt action rifle. One hand goes on the butt, the other on the muzzle? not sure what that part is called, the outer edge of the rifle to stabalize it. When you need to reload, you can just naturally let go of the butt with the right hand, grab the bolt pull it back, grab a bullet, put it in, push the bolt back, and grab the butt again. All of this feels like you're doing it. On a vive controller it would be cumbersome as hell to try this process. 

The one other thing that I would say is that the controller remapping thing that they have (like the steam controller one) is really sweet to use with the index controllers. I have my right grip in pavlov bound to dropping the clip, and my left grip bound to hitting the slide lock. Both grips are also bound to hold things, but at a lower pressure value. This means that I can keep holding the gun, drop the clip, let go of the gun with the left hand, grab a clip, toss it in, and then grab the gun to stablize it and automatically hit the slide lock so it's ready to fire. 

I would imagine that like pretty much everything that valve makes they will go on sale at some point... but given how much HL:A will push hardware sales I wouldn't expect it to happen at any point in the near future.",1574447141,f8bwt5e,t3_e0098m,/r/Vive/comments/e0098m/are_the_index_controllers_worth_it/f8bwt5e/,1,Vive,comment

Sure in scenarios like horror games and space exploration the OLEDS has big advantages. However due to the difference in subpixel arrangements LCD displays looks more sharp and has less screen door effect. This is noticeable in any scenarios. Both HMDs have the same total number of pixels, but the Index has larger FOV which means the pixels are spread more apart. Reports confirm that the perceived clarity on both headsets is about the same, but the Index has noticeably improved FOV without compromising clarity.",1574450720,f8c27cc,t3_e04tay,/r/Vive/comments/e04tay/was_about_to_buy_the_vive_pro_but/f8c27cc/,1,Vive,comment

**Name:** POLYBIUS

**Price:** $17.99

**Supported Platforms:** Windows

#About This Game

POLYBIUS is a fast, trippy tunnel shooter playable on a normal screen or in VR
for the best effect. It features 50 levels of blissful trance shooting action
set to a blistering soundtrack. The PS4 version was EDGE Magazine's VR GOTY in
2017, and the PC version of the game was even used as the basis for a NIN
music video. So put on your trance trousers, bust out the Oculus if you have
one, and strap in for a euphoric ride.  
  
  
  
Blast, boost and fly through 50 geometrical environments. Hit the boost gates
to increase your speed. How fast dare you go? More speed means more points but
also more danger!  
  
  
  
Pick up powerup pills along the way to increase your firepower, become
invincible, launch yourself to stratospheric speeds, even slow down time.  
  
  
  
POLYBIUS is designed to bring you quickly to a euphoric flow state, and to
keep you there the whole time you are playing. There are no bosses to spike
your progress, and the game will never make you redo sections - progress made
is progress kept, always, even if you lose a life. We want you to come out of
every game of Polybius, whether or not you've beaten your highscore, smiling
and happy because you've enjoyed the act of playing so much.  
  
  
  
Drop in for a quick blast or settle in for a long trip with Llamasoft's tried
and true arcade game modes: Pure (start from the beginning and see how far you
can get), Endurance (start from the beginning with a fixed number of lives, no
extras are awarded during Endurance games), or Normal.  
  
  
  
In a Normal Mode game, you can choose to restart from any level you have
previously arrived at. Our Restart Best system starts you off with the best-
ever lives and score that you've had at that point in any game previously.
Over time you can dip in and improve the individual Restart Best stats for any
of the levels and gradually build a platform for achieving better and better
high scores.  
  
  
  
The inspiration for POLYBIUS was an old urban legend about a strange,
abstract, psychedelic arcade game that was supposedly released for a brief
time in the 1980s. According to the legend people who played the game
experienced strange and rather unpleasant psychological reactions after
becoming addicted to it. There was talk of the CIA and Men in Black. Of course
the legendary game has never actually been found but - especially with the
advent of VR - we thought it might be fun to make a game inspired by the old
legend. Our version is intended only to have positive effects on the minds of
its users though!  
  
  
  
Don't just take our word for it, read for yourself some quotes from PS4
players after getting their hands on POLYBIUS!  
  
  
  
**POLYBIUS! I can't believe a game can make me feel such joy. Thank you @llamasoft_ox for an incredible experience!**  
  
Polybius is easily one of the best immersive PSVR showcases, alongside Rez
Infinite, Thumper and SuperHyperCube - amazing work.  
  
**The difference between non-VR and VR modes is incredible - even the title screen is astonishing. @llamasoft_ox has found his ideal canvas :)**  
  
@llamasoft_ox what have you done to my brain?  
  
**@llamasoft_ox thx for providing such a wonderful VR gaming xperience. Most immersive, fun and addictive #psvr game so far!**  
  
I think it's the best game you have ever written, it's fucking epic! Nice one
mate :-)  
  
**Any initial WTF? Confusion of #Polybius is soon replaced with euphoria &amp; a great big grin. Amazing work @llamasoft_ox and all involved**  
  
Polybius from @llamasoft_ox has the most *brilliant* 3D TV mode - great fun
even without PSVR. First reason I‚Äôve ever had to switch TV to 3D  
  
**#Polybius in VR. Blimey. Words can't begin to describe it. Never before has a videogame given me a headrush. My compliments to @llamasoft_ox**  
  
What you can't hear in this POLYBIUS (PSVR) clip is me laughing w/delight; thx
@llamasoft_ox  
  
**Oh My God. Polybius is the best PSVR game by a mile. If you have a PSVR, you *need* this game.**  
  
Polybius wow ! Played to level 20 and now I feel chiiiiiiiiiiled üêë first time
in ages I am not worrying myself sick. 10/10  
  
**Get #Polybius by @llamasoft_ox for PSVR. It's gorgeous, mind warping and extremely fun. Very inspirational as well!**  
  
Shout out to #Polybius and @llamasoft_ox. Great game. I wondered what an 80s
shooter would feel like inside an arcade game. This is it #psvr  
  
**Halted my POLYBIUS time until tomorrow but let the eldest have a go before bed and as I was making a brew, all I could hear was laughter.**  
  
So if you have a PSVR then you need to get Polybius. If you don't have a PSVR
then get one and get Polybius. My word @llamasoft_ox  
  
**So far Polybius by @llamasoft_ox is incredible and doesn't want to let me go.. love it!**  
  
Well #Polybius is ridiculous. When you are really going + the screen is
pulsing, colours separating ‚Äî I think I taste colour.  
  
**Blimey! Just played Polybius, the most intense legal trip you‚Äôll ever take. Legendary work @llamasoft_ox this is THE reason for having PSVR**  
  
1st VR Polybius run. Holy mackerel! You get in a trance zone, when you finally
run out of shields, you're like what day is it @llamasoft_ox  
  
**#Polybius is ridiculous fun @llamasoft_ox has absolutely nailed it!**  
  
Blew the dust off the psvr for @llamasoft_ox Polybius. Techno goodness.
IncrediBull  
  
**@llamasoft_ox Dude, you *so* nailed it. Relaxed into the game tonight and did so much better. All the things you spoke about - delivered.**  
Go with the flow is about all the instruction you need for Polybius. I should
be in bed but here I am. Beautiful. Thanks @llamasoft_ox  
  
**Seriously, I have the *biggest* grin on my face right now, and it‚Äôs all @llamasoft_ox‚Äôs fault. #polybius**  
  
@llamasoft_ox New Jeff game... Download NOW and... 4K 60fps = amazing! Plug in
PSVR... I HAVE NO WORDS!!! 30 years I been waiting for this!

The knuckles have a few other benefits over the Vive wands.

* Strapped to your hand. It's minor, but such a huge difference from having to ""actively"" hold the Vive wands like TV remotes. I have less hand/arm fatigue after long play sessions (just don't make the straps TOO tight! Keep them loose but firm)
* Lighter and ""smaller"". The tracking bar sometimes gets in the way of things, but rarely. Just be careful in Beat Saber
* THUMBSTICKS. While most VR games don't support/feature finger tracking, having thumbsticks is such a nice feature. Movement is less awkward since it's not bound to that stupid trackpad.
* More natural ""grip"" control. The grip buttons on the Vive wands fucking suck, especially if you are like me and have rubber sleeves over them to protect from nicks and scratches. Knuckles ""grip"" button is more of a sensor seeing if your hand is closed or not. There is a force sensor in the grips as well, so there is a difference between a **HARD** grip and a light grip. (again, devs need to take these force readings and implement them, but the easier grip ""button"" is just a nice upgrade)",1574460016,f8cgyzb,t3_e06rgd,/r/Vive/comments/e06rgd/knuckles_owners_best_games/f8cgyzb/,1,Vive,comment

4602,Spitfirre,t2_5bh9i,"Hilariously, after playing a few hours of Skyrim VR, I realized that having it be in VR actually fixed a HUGE problem I had with games like Skyrim. Namely: the broken loot economy

In 2D Skyrim, I was looting every goddamn urn/chest/body/sack/shelf in the game, and would regularly end up with so much gold I could buy anything I wanted with no real cost. I would run out of vendors to sell things to, so I would mod the game to give them more starting gold to exchange.

In VR though, physically reaching over to loot everything was EXHAUSTING. The action itself wasn't bad, but doing it over and over and over **and over and over again** got real boring, tedious, and would burn way more calories than expected. I would enter a room with a hundred urns, groan, then just ignore them all.

Suddenly, I was having to pick and choose what to carry, what to loot, and in effect, balanced the game's economy. I would have to consider which armor to buy from a vendor, or save up to get a nice weapon upgrade.

4622,KBMUSE29,t2_ero39,"Oddly, the games I love playing the most with them so far are Asgard's Wrath and Stormland. In Asgard's Wrath my favorite thing to do after knocking an enemies shield down (if needed) is spam throwing swords/axes at their heads while avoiding damage using the thumb stick, which ends up being a pretty good arm work out.  The smooth movement system in Stormland and specifically climbing/gliding around feels pretty awesome too.  I also prefer the Index form factor while playing Beat Saber and Pistol Whip, it's subtle, but feels right.

 Note: I turned my knuckles grab sensitivity down after it was causing issues in Swords &amp; Sorcery, but I'm not sure that affects other games.

One thing to keep in mind is that Half Life Alex and Index were co-developed together.  The interactions in HLA were being used to define the inputs required for the Index controller.  And since the Index is relatively new, it'll take some time for developers to take full advantage of it.  The challenging aspect is that it takes quite a bit of work to add in the fine tuned Index specific details that won't be available to other motion controllers, so I don't expect too many games to take full advantage of it anytime soon.  However, HLA has the potential to create a new VR ecosystem of interactive content using the new Source 2 Hammer VR toolset which will be released along with the game.  This will enable moders to create new content and games similar to the start of Counter Strike and a handful of others.  If those take off I could see the amount of available content that make full use of the knuckles increase exponentially.",1574464330,f8cnkag,t3_e06rgd,/r/Vive/comments/e06rgd/knuckles_owners_best_games/f8cnkag/,1,Vive,comment

Second video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBBi\_TwKZ7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBBi_TwKZ7A) 

This man plays Football VR Tournament 2018 with PSVR, using his legs: you can play a match, but I don't know if it works properly.

And so here is my question: can I play Football VR Tournament (playing a match), using Vive Trackers. It would be amazing, I would play a ""real"" proper virtual game!

&gt;6.1 Inference Runtime Performance
 
 
&gt;The time **to infer a FullHD frame on 4x NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs** is 9ms. The DeepFovea model has 3.1 million parameters and requires 111 GFLOP with 2.2GB memory footprint per GPU for an inference pass. ... Time to sparsify a frame on a single GPUis 0.7ms. We are able to achieve 90Hz in the HMD
 
 
Naturally, from each sparse input frame, you need to infer(fill in) the full HD(1920x1080 total res - not per eye here) and that needs four Tesla V100 GPUs!

4846,smells_like_wee,t2_31013mib," Lens adaptor for HTC Vive VR to replace Fresnel lenses / Gear VR / or Carl Zeiss with 52mm Aspheric lens from BOBOVR Z6

This mod is for the original HTC Vive only, not Pro or cosmos, while these lens and adaptors may fit I don't have these headsets to create any kind of calibration settings.

The BOBOVR Z6 uses a large 52mm (43mm usable area) clear aspheric hyperboloid lens lens which fits perfectly into the HTC Vive, unfortunately there is a slight difference in focal length therefore requiring adaptors. The BOBO lenses are fitted to the headset by a snap fit ring which can be carefully released by separating it from the base then used to fit over these adaptors. The only disadvantage is acquiring the BOBO headset and cost around $24 shipped from china.

The overall result is an almost factory finish with the lenses only protruding around 5mm from the original lens allowing greater room for glasses wearers. Clarity and sweet spot is equivalent or better than the common Gear VR modification.

In addition field of view is the same or actually greater both horizontally and vertically than original lenses (at same scale). Chromatic aberration is almost identical or better than original, however there is some slight barrel distortion and pupillary swim which can be mostly removed by calibration. (see calibration figures below). However headset placement on the face is more critical. IPD distance seems to be better if adjusted to approx 3mm less than actual IPD. Godrays are better than original or mostly equivalent to Gear VR lens. The only perceived disadvantage is there is some slight reflective/refraction of out of site image at the very edges of the lens.

Its a slightly preferable mod to the Gear VR lens mod as with the wider fov it more immersive and feels less like wearing binoculars.

Note. I originally made these adaptors at a height of 5.74mm however on testing the focus wasn't actually quite perfect so have manually modified them to improve this (with some small blobs of blutac currently, this may be due to margin of error from the prints as one eye seems better than the other even though its the same part so I have modified the model to a depth of 6mm for better tolerance but I don't actually own a 3d printer to test this or other variations, sending these out to print adds more cost, so as such this version is untested but should be ok, maybe I'll be lucky and Santa will bring bring me a printer).",1574353317,f88ei12,t3_dzllce,/r/Vive/comments/dzllce/htc_vive_lens_adaptor_bobovr_z6_lens_43mm_lens/f88ei12/,1,Vive,comment
4847,smells_like_wee,t2_31013mib,"Instructions to apply calibrate the headset better to the lenses (this is based on my own headset so you may need to tweak your values to suit).

Plug in your HMD, turn on lighthouses, run steam.

1. Go to: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SteamVR\\tools\\lighthouse\\bin\\win32\\
2. Run: lighthouse\_console.exe
3. Download your current config, using command: downloadconfig og\_vive\_config.json  
(ensure your headset is in view of lighthouses and display is on by activating proximity sensor, otherwise you will get an error such as""Expected 3502 bytes of config but only found 2418. Rejecting config Unable to read config from device""
4. File will be saved in the current directory(make many backups, email it to yourself, save it on a cloud drive etc. so you can reverse this mod if necessary). Make a copy calling it something new such as ""mod\_config.json"" and replace the ""tracking\_to\_eye\_transform"" section with the settings below. (leave all the other code alone).
5. Upload a new config with the ""lighthouse\_console.exe"" using command: uploadconfig mod\_config.json
6. Restart SteamVR and check the result.

To reverse the process just upload the original config file.

I suspect Valve has thus far done what it needs to do VR timing, hardware and software wise, to ensure its relevance in its core business activities, PC game sales, and likely will continue with such tactics as VR evolves. Valve still has the option to pivot, if it needs to.

Facebook has a slightly different VR objective and will continue to do whatever it can to achieve those goals, a genuine walled garden that can be stand alone, but will allow use with a PC.

[Vive Cosmos HMD with Valve Wand Controllers (v1.0)](/r/Vive/comments/dzs98y/vive_cosmos_hmd_with_valve_wand_controllers_v10/) by  dunks89


Pretty much what the title says - anyone come across a 3rd party solution to use the Cosmos with older hardware? The tracking on the new controllers is trash, and I'm not particularly excited to wait (and pay) for a $200 backwards-upgrade in 2020.

[Am I too slow for valve?](/r/Vive/comments/dzuaho/am_i_too_slow_for_valve/) by  zincer2


Quick little discussion thread here...   
I bought my vive a few months ago and love it, but now that we have the knuckles i want to know if its worth the get?  
Like I really want to get the knuckle controllers but I fear that my vive is gonna become outdated with how fast things are progressing... Do you think its worth investing in new controllers like that or will my vive go the way of the radio for something new in a year or two?

The thingies you attach to the wall are called ""Lighthouses"". They increase the speed, accuracy, and reliability of your movement tracking.

In the same way someone wouldn't buy a Switch for Untitled Goose Game, I don't think people would buy VR for say, Duck Season. But, when you have titles like BOTW and Super Mario Odyssey, it becomes easier to sell the hardware. All of the games on the scale of something like Half Life: Alyx are Oculus exclusives right now, and most are smaller in scale.

It *is* how the world goes. Companies (successful ones, anyway) are devices that at their core produce money. If there's an option that provides a bunch of money with little downside then of course they'll take it.

And it's certainly not like there's anything illegal about these exclusivity deals, either - they don't need excuses for that reason.

Like it or hate it, but publicly traded companies don't need excuses to make money.

&gt; The money will not be used to support the developers. It'll either just be thrown onto the massive pile of money in the company's coffers or the CEO's pockets.

Investors usually aren't too happy about that, either - they'd much rather have it paid out in dividends.

&gt; That isn't a requirement for AAA companies, who are just fine without it.

EA and Ubisoft could throw cash out their windows and still be just fine. Again, their goal is to make money, and turning down opportunities to cut out a needless 10-20% fee is very appealing.",1574243043,f84dqk9,t1_f84daku,/r/Vive/comments/dyi479/all_these_highbudget_rift_exclusives_are_starting/f84dqk9/,1,Vive,comment

I didn't buy VR for a then theoretical HL game anymore than I bought my first PC for a then theoretical Half Life game. I bought in for what was already available.  

I don't believe the term ""killer app"" really applies here. VR is what it is. A tool to be used however the end user see's fit. Be it practical or entertainment application, it has something to offer anyone who takes the time to learn about it and explore what is on offer. The possibilities are endless. 

That all said, people are people and right now, gaming is where VR is most prominent. Half life really popularised PC gaming back in the 90's to the point it was seen ""as good as if not better than"" console gaming at that time. At a time when Nintendo, Sega and Sony reigned supreme (well...Nintendo and Sony at least), it was very refreshing to see console gamer's suddenly want to buy their first PC but Valve didn't do it totally on their own. Other games where there as well and hopefully this is history repeating itself. 

There's no doubt about it, HL:A has generated a lot of buzz and at first glance, it would appear to be the game that gets a lot of gamers prepared to buy into VR. It might not be ""the"" killer app to us (for good reason) but it might well be the game that sells a couple more million headsets.

You can put just one base station in A mode and start up Home. It will prevent one from compensating for the other, and let you assess whether it's tracking properly. If your headset works well with one lighthouse and not the other, then you've got solid evidence. 

Also, a quick LPT to make sure your lighthouses are aligned: put your camera in selfie mode and make sure the opposite lighthouse is center of frame just at/off the top of the frame. It makes a significant difference in reliability.

Since the base station is a cube, you can just hold the back of your phone to the front of it and your camera will be pointing in the same direction as the base station. If you put it in selfie mode, you basically have a screen showing you what its line of sight is.

If the other base station is directly in the middle of your picture, then the camera (and also the station you're adjusting) are both pointing directly at it.

&gt; In marketing terminology, a **killer application** (commonly shortened to **killer app**) is any [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that is so necessary or desirable that it proves the core value of some larger technology, such as [computer hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware), a [gaming console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console), [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software), a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), a [software platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_platform), or an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system).[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application#cite_note-1) In other words, consumers would buy the (usually expensive) hardware just to run that application. A killer app can substantially increase sales of the platform on which it runs. 

I appears that *HL: Alyx* may well be the killer app for the Knuckles controller and may also boost sales significantly for the Valve Index and potentially for other HMDs.  Valve is a mega-corporation and there is a huge base of *HL* fans.",1574276218,f85iwoo,t1_f84cilm,/r/Vive/comments/dyxo8o/halflife_alyx_is_not_going_to_be_the_first_killer/f85iwoo/,1,Vive,comment

5467,ProfessorGoogle,t2_6c97k,"&gt; it's still a third person controlled game (I forget the name, but there was one anime-style beat em up I enjoyed you played with the controller, and you ""watched"" the character do their thing on what looked like a floating platform in front of you).

Sounds like the premise of [Holoception](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1064160/Holoception/). You control a tiny stick figure that mirrors your movements. You can adjust the scale of the game in real time. A word of warning though: It is in early access and there are a few bugs they seem to be ironing out still.

There's also the Oculus exclusive Brass Tactics, which is a similar style to Final Assault.

I am pretty nearsighted and I was delighted to discover that I don't need any glasses, however, with my Vive Pro.  Evidently the focal distance is closer than with the Rift.

I also experimented with a DIY solution taking apart a pair of old glasses and wedging the frame into the Rift that worked very well.

5821,kendoka15,t2_fu37d,It depends on the headset. The OG Vive's internal rendering resolution (no supersampling) is 3024x1680 but the Vive Pro is 4032x2240 (both headsets render at 1.4x each dimension to account for the lenses but this ratio may vary slightly on other headsets). That means the Vive Pro needs your GPU to push 8% more pixels than 4K. Of course VR-only games are usually made to run on current hardware with current headsets in mind so they're usually less demanding than regular PC games at the same resolution. Red Dead 2 on the other hand seems to be tuned for future hardware at its max settings so it's not a great comparison,1574141650,f80xpab,t1_f806ox4,/r/Vive/comments/dy97np/benchmarking_vr_performance_of_the_gtx_1660_super/f80xpab/,1,Vive,comment

No disagreement here. It's way too front-heavy as-is. I couldn't even play it for longer than 30 minutes before getting face pain.

But, the $2 counterweigh mod I got fixed that entirely. Now I can play it for hours without any discomfort. 

The Index was very, very comfortable! ...But dealing with a wire was just too much for me. I kept thinking I'd get used to it, and I just kept...not getting used to it.

5879,krista,t2_9gl6,"i really don't think they can lower cost much at all. what a *lot* of people don't understand is how extremely labour intensive making the knuckles is, as well as the index, and how amazingly precise each base station must be and how exacting its individual calibration. 



the index and knuckles are made in china, although the light-to-digital chips were designed in the usa and fabricated in either europe or at tsmc (i haven't chased that supply chain past designer triad semiconductor).  each knuckle (dv version, because it was handy) has 21 of them with attached to photodiodes connected to a pcb via a pfc^(*) unique to each sensor. as these sensors are placed on the front above the trigger, on the bottom by the strap tensioner, on th control surface, and all over the arch knuckle guard (14 there alone), they must be assembled and connected by hand. we haven't even got to the capacitive sensors all over this thing that *also* need to be hand assembled. oh, assembly is a major cost of *simple* devices, and quite often upwards of 20% of the total per unit cost. for complicated hand assembly, we're looking at a lot more.



the hmd is likely also assembled by hand, although it is probably proportionally less expensive to assemble as it isn't ~~a shitshow of complicated curves~~ as critical to design the hmd to minimize volume and weight at the expense of manufacturing complexity.


considering the above, plus support costs, i can't imagine valve's margin on either the hmd or controllers is more than 10%, and i feel this is a significant over-estimation. i wouldn't be surprised if the margin was under 1%, or even slightly negative right now. please keep in mind that this doesn't include recuperation of development costs.



the base stations might be different, as i understand they are made in the usa. at one point, i was hearing rumor that each base station would be $60 in lots of 45 for oems selling them with hmds. i also heard that was valve's cost.



what we *do* know is that the motors are custom made for valve, the base stations are extremely precisely made and after calibration (6 parameters for v1... i think there's 5 for v2, but i'm not confident in that exact number) they're accurate and repeatable in their spindle rotation to a small number of *atoms*. i'm not sure what number this is for v2, but [v1's spindles were rotation accurate to under 2500 atoms](https://hackaday.com/2016/12/21/alan-yates-why-valves-lighthouse-cant-work/). we also know they're $150 each on steam in the usa, and the full kit is $150 less expensive than ordering √† la carte.



accounting for the price difference in packaging material, shipping costs, and logistics, i'd estimate the difference is between $100 and $125.



that valve seems more willing to cross/advanced ship base station rmas tells me that failure rates of the complex precision mechanical laser platform were expected and priced accordingly. this leads me to believe the actual manufacturing cost of a base station is around $75, and they effectively give you the second one free if you purchase the full kit as a package deal, leaving $25-75 on the table as ‚Äùprofit‚Äù after costs before r&amp;d recuperation by my slightly informed and experienced guesswork and estimation.




materials costs aren't going to come down unless volume increases astronomically, so the obvious places to look for cost reduction are reducing assembly time and complexity and/or reducing defect and failure rate and the associated expenses downstream (more reliable units means less spent in support and rma)



triad semiconductor, the company making custom light-to-digital chips for valve that each knuckle uses 21 of, also makes the sample hardware for valve's steamvr tracking hdk. as of now, triad has made 2 public versions of the hdk hardware, corresponding with v1 and v2 lighthouse technology, and triad has made 2 versions of their light-to-digital chip.


the v2 hdk hardware has been sold out at triad for months, as well as the v2 light-to-digital chips. 


triad has a new product listed on the website: the [ts8730 tiny single chip light to digital converter with ontegrated photodiode](https://www.triadsemi.com/product/ts8730/) with ‚Äùdetails coming soon...‚Äù as the description.


to me, this means that valve is likely taking a stab at simplifying manufacturing and assembly of the knuckles and hmd, as this would reduce part count and sub-assembly count substantially, and probably speed hand-assembly, thereby reducing a major expense. as the part count decreases, the reliability, specifically the defect rate should decrease, increasing margins a little bit.



the other possibility for triad's new part doesn't exclude our previous paragraph's speculation, but if this thing is what i think it is, we will probably be getting a redesigned and streamlined lower cost steamvr tracking hdk based around optimization of v2 lighthouse technology.


lastly, and *this is pure and probably hopeful speculation on my part*, this opens the possibility of a smaller, less expensive, and far better tracking puck, either made by valve or a 3rd party. i've got a few things in the works personally that i need a (very out of stock) hdk for that a new improved hdk or tracker would excite me greatly, and possibly excite *you* with what i make with it and how it works :)

5890,TomC69,t2_qpbs6ed,"Maybe check that you have the latest bio as this has been a very common problem with msi laptops and the Rift S.  I think the latest bios is E16Q2IMS.112.  Just check it out on the msi support page for you model.

Also check that you have the a fairly up to date nvidia driver.  I suggest using 436.48 since this was issued to provide Cosmos support.

Otherwise, contact Vive support.  They usually get back to you pretty quickly.  During office hours their support chat can help as well.

I hate to say this but your laptop is never going to be brilliant for VR with the Cosmos imho.  High res goggles like the Cosmos, Index, Vive Pro, and esp. Reverb really need a good CPU/GPU combo, together with good cooling in order to give good results.  I retired (now home office duties) my Alienware 17r4 gaming laptop with similar specs to yours 6 months ago and built a proper gaming desktop (i9 9900k water cooled, gtx1080ti, 32Gb 3000 ram, 1tb ssd, 4tb hdd) and this has significantly improved my VR enjoyment.  I'm running an Oculus Rift cv1 w/2x sensors and a Cosmos.  Actually, very easy to switch between the 2 systems on the fly.

If a proper desktop gaming PC is out of the question you may want to consider returning the Cosmos and picking up an Oculus Quest and trying its new PC link.

If you look at the linkbox (the side that feeds cables to the computer) you'll see a small, empty slot. This is a mini-Display Port slot (miniDP). On your graphics card, you should see at least one full size Display Port slot (DP). I removed the HDMI cable that goes from the linkbox to my comnputer, and replaced it with a miniDP to DP cable, like the one in this  link: https://www.amazon.com/Moread-DisplayPort-Gold-Plated-Thunderbolt-Resolution/dp/B01N5RY8D7/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3FE9LWVKCFXKU&amp;keywords=mini+dp+to+dp&amp;qid=1574170432&amp;sprefix=minidp+to+%2Caps%2C213&amp;sr=8-4

Isn't the fact that the Index controllers haven't been used for new gameplay features a problem for Valve?

Valve aren't jackasses but they put a lot of investment into these things.

By ""hardware"" do they mean headset and drivers or everything? Steam has VR ecosystem/headset support mentioned differently than controllers.

SkyrimVR for example supports gamepads. There are people still who only use gamepads with OG Rift.

""Obviously they don't mean gamepads!!!""

Incorrect. As i've already mentioned, they've earned it currently.

&gt;  To pay for a game without seeing or playing the game is just foolish, no matter who the company is, on top of that to say you would pay double the price of a standard game? It screams more money than sense.

Also incorrect. All that tells you is *how much* trust i have in them remaining.

I've already seen what they did with The Lab. They were responsible for the Vive, and now the Index. These people by all accounts seem to know what they are doing when it comes to VR.

And this is a VR product, placed (we'll see soon?) in their flagship product universe, and they've had several years now to work on it while having the opportunity of being able to dictate how the hardware is going to function alongside.

First and foremost, there aren't counterfeit Vive units. There's plenty of cheap VR headsets, but nothing in the wild that has the Vive / HTC logo on it and tries to look like a Vive.

My guess, this ""1.5"" Vive is referring to the later revision of the first gen Vive. The later revision of the Vive featured blue (instead of grey) straps on the wands, and had the HDMI/USB and power cables stuffed into one cable (there's still 3 cables inside, but they're bound together). I believe the launch Vive had 3 separate cables. Granted both of these things are easy to swap.

6045,squidc,t2_oah87,"You really don't know that, and why do people blindly upvote comments like this without giving it a thought. Valve's strategy for making money isn't centered around selling hardware. It never has been their strategy, and it likely won't ever be. They are invested in, first, getting people into PC gaming if they're not already, and second to get those people onto the steam platform where they'll buy games.

If the math works out that the cost of lowering the price of the hardware is less than the value of those additional people on their platform, then they'll reduce the cost of the hardware.

Steam is also the reason we've not seen more Valve IP over the last decade. They have the luxury of being able to wait for really great ideas to pursue before pursuing anything, all while the checks keep coming in due to steam sales.

That said, the Index has only been out for a couple months.  One other thing Valve prides itself on is listening to customers--and it ªs going to piss off a lot of people who have already spent money adopting the Index if they suddenly drop the price on it.

Economics of it also don ªt make sense.  If you have a thing that people want, you charge people for that thing.  Converse to your argument, if the math works out that they can keep making money at the current price, then they ªre not going to drop the price.

Only other things to check is your nvidia control panel 3d settings.  Make sure you select prefer max performance on your power option.  I also recommend selecting a high performance power plan ( when plugged into your wall power supply) and disable any USB power savings.

[Long Distance Relationship &amp; VR](/r/Vive/comments/dys0yr/long_distance_relationship_vr/) by  MrDylanTee


Hey so I had a thought recently. My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship and I thought maybe getting her a VR headset could help us. Are there any online games that play like GTA5 in the sense that it's open world, you can drive around, and has things we could do together like explore a new area of the map, play tennis, watch TV, etc. Almost like a real-life simulator. Thanks!

6082,jolard,t2_2qiei,"Frankly this is exactly the problem with the Index controllers. They are way too expensive for just a casual upgrade, so they will never be in enough homes to make it viable for game developers to include anything but cosmetic or inconsequential features for the controllers. And that of course means that people are less likely to buy them at the cost they are because it is a lot of money to spend to get cosmetic features.   


Personally I think Valve should have bit the bullet and released lighthouses for $40 each and the Index Controllers for $100. If they had done that then nearly every Vive owner would have upgraded, because $100 is a hell of a lot more justifiable than $270, and even Oculus and WMR users might have bought the $180 bundle to get knuckles and lighthouses.

[Base station updates then won't turn on.](/r/Vive/comments/dyuquy/base_station_updates_then_wont_turn_on/) by  ManWithQuestionsPC


So I bought my VIVE last Christmas and it worked fine for a few months until I updated both base stations and one just refused to turn on. I had this issue for a few days before I manually restored an older version of the software inside the base station which seemed to fix it but calibration was hugely off. This solution worked fine until I upgraded my PC and in a moment of stupidity updated the base station and the issue has started again.   


If anyone else had this issue and knows of a solid solution it would be greatly appreciated, I followed what instructions I could find on VIVE's website to no avail.

6284,Mahorium,t2_4a9gw207,"Vr can break the chicken and the egg problem with a foveated rendering and 4k per eye headset. Right now there is a trade off for all VR games: you get an increased sense of immersion in exchange for inferior visuals. With foveated rendering this trade off disappears, and playing a game in VR becomes both better in terms of immersion and in terms of display fidelity. 

If we can reach that point it then makes sense to simply port most 3rd person action games to VR and have people use a controller to play them like they would normally. At this point the chicken and the egg problem is solved as VR ports using controllers are not very expensive to make, but with a sufficiently advanced VR headset they could be quite compelling. Unfortunately this means motion controls and the VR game market as we know it will largely be left behind, but it will be necessary to take VR mainstream.",1574050471,f7xa39h,t1_f7tskap,/r/Vive/comments/dxlgaq/2019_a_landmark_year_for_virtual_reality_summary/f7xa39h/,1,Vive,comment
6285,Nagorak,t2_z10ui,"9900K is literally the fastest gaming CPU in existence. If it couldn't handle wireless then almost no one could use it.

Anyway, as far as what you need for the WA, for regular Vive anything with 4 cores/8 threads+ is good enough. You may be able to get away with 4/4, but it's not completely ideal. Vive Pro you need 6 cores+, with SMT also being a plus, but not necessarily required. 

I'd recommend something like the  Ryzen 3600, 3700X, 3900X, i7 8700K, i7 9700K, i7 9900K. Second gen Ryzen (2600/2600X/2700/2700X) can also run it (personal experience), and i5 9600/8600 probably would also be fine, but if buying new you may as well get one of the previously listed CPUs.",1574050893,f7xalbu,t1_f7x8ntc,/r/Vive/comments/dxxl08/vive_wireless_on_9900k/f7xalbu/,1,Vive,comment

For me the application that hammers my pc the hardest is X Plane 11.  This is mainly because it is currently poorly optimized for multi threading.  This should improve in the next 3-6 months as it starts to use Vulkan (Vulcan?).

I‚Äôm able to run xp11 wired at pretty high settings and still maintain a nice smooth 45 FPS.  With wireless this drops down to 35 fps.  So the wireless system in this case is knocking off about 20-25% performance.  In order to get back to 45 FPS I need to drop my super sampling down quite a bit.

Assetto Corsa performance also suffers a bit as well, around 15% loss when using wireless.

The idea is that some elements of the screen can be drawn at a normal resolution, but things like UI elements can be rendered much higher with strong anti-aliasing and (depending on what they are, eg rectangles) the HMD driver can play some special tricks to make them look sharper.

IMO the effective angular resolution on most 2nd-generation headsets (Quest/Index/Rift S/Vive Pro) is fine for game worlds (though obviously higher would be better), but text and UI elements could really do with a resolution bump.

For small scale operations and feedback this would work great if there was a way to fill them with an air/water mixture you could make it also simulate the weight of objects but this would make it more bulky and it would be hard to drain the ballon without changing its shape drastically.

6342,Mahorium,t2_4a9gw207,"Motion controls will still exist as an optional add on for headsets, but the real mass seller will be playing ports using a controller. Motion controllers are needed right now because playing games you could otherwise play on a TV on a vr headset is simply not that compelling. The vr mode will need to lower the graphics settings and will simply look worse than if you viewed it on the TV. With foveated rendering those graphic compromises don't need to be made, and with 4k it will look close to as sharp add it does on your tv. 

Price is another advantage of this approach. If motion controls are optional headsets should be able to be made for around 250-$350, which falls nicely into the normal consumer expected price for an add on product. Porting non motion controlls games to use motion controls is hard, which is why we don't have many good ports, but porting to use a controller and a vr headset really isn't very hard. 

Vr can survive without going down this route, but I wouldn't expect the same kind of growth we had the last few years. Lots of companies lost lots of money in the vr market. Investors expected a larger market by now and are getting spooked. AAA games require a lot of money to make, so it doesn't make sense to expect any for a long time.

6406,Mahorium,t2_4a9gw207,"Like I said, it's because modern vr headsets do not provide a compelling experience without the addition of motion controls currently. Once that changes then motion controllerless vr makes a lot of sense for the average gamer. What I'm saying is that foveated rendering fundamentally changes the game. It didn't make sense to play AAA controller ports on your vr headset because they just looked worse than on your 4k tv, but once we get high res and foveated rendering vr objectively becomes the best way to play normal games.

I could be wrong about high res and foveated rendering headsets. They could end up being still less compelling than the tv/monitor for most games. If that's the case though, I wouldn't expect the mainstreaming of vr for at least another 10 years. It would require hundreds of millions in game development investment loss to get past the chicken and the egg problem. I just don't see that in an environment where investors are already pressuring companies like Facebook about the lackluster vr growth.

The most likely future for a motion controller based vr ecosystem is slow but consistent growth, indie games, and a slowdown in investment.

[HTC is out of Replacement Parts](/r/Vive/comments/dydokh/htc_is_out_of_replacement_parts/) by  dornadigital


Be warned if you attempt to get replacement parts from HTC... Apparently they don't have any. They spent weeks messing with me before admitting they couldn't do anything. That was months ago, and my in-warranty headset still can't power on. They also said they couldn't extend the warranty, so I guess I just have to sit and hope I get the part sometime in the next decade.

6813,a_gilling,t2_9ubp99,"Summary for those who dont want to watch the video:

2019 has been a big year for VR and the Video goes in to detail why I think it will be looked back on as a Landmark Year for Virtual Reality.

The video is split into 2 parts, Hardware and Software.

**Hardware** \- I go into a little detail about the past and why I think VR didnt take off as much as industry insiders expected. I then talk about the new headsets we have had launch this year

Oculus launched the Rift S and Quest in May, Valve launched the Index in June and HTC launched something called the cosmos no one gives a shit about.

We now have 3 new headsets that cater to different audiences and give more options with the quest an affordable option for people without a pS4 or Gaming PC, Rift S is priced well and easy to setup with inside out tracking and the Index for those with deeper pockets who want less compromises.

You also still have the PSVR which is the cheapest and most affordable of all of them if you have a PS4 already with them dropping to $200-250 on a regular basis.

Its now never been easier for someone to get in to VR gaming, the Quest is selling well and overall we have turned a corner in terms of accessability and ease of use while having a significant step forward in visual clarity and comfort.

**Software** \- Back in the beginning of Consumer VR the games were very basic with lots of short indie wave shooters and things that felt more like tech demos rather than the Fully Fleshed out VR games we want. Developers were playing it safe with lots of games using Teleportation movement, especially the exclusive stuff from Oculus and Sony.

Big AAA games take along time to develop with large teams of people working full time on them and cost alot of money. Only now after 3 years of Consumer VR are we starting to see the big games we have dreamt of like Asgards Wrath, Blood and Truth and Stormland with Iron Man VR, Medal of Honor and Lone Echo 2 on the Horizon. 

They are all exclusives but we are also seeing smaller indie developers really start to get to grip with VR game development with some of the earlier studios bringing out some next level games terms of scope and world interactions, Games like Boneworks, Walking Dead Saints and Sinners, Espire:1 etc and we have lots more games in the works that we know of and alot that will be announced next year.

Overall I think this has been a massive year for VR gaming with some big steps forward for both hardware and software, we also have the PS5 confirmed next year which will support the current PSVR plus loads more excellent games that feel like a generation forward.

Do people agree with me or am I just talking out of my Poo Pipe?",1573989972,f7s1wmb,t3_dxlgaq,/r/Vive/comments/dxlgaq/2019_a_landmark_year_for_virtual_reality_summary/f7s1wmb/,1,Vive,comment

6817,Seanspeed,t2_lzl77,"Hard to say.  Your tracking issues are kinda unusual, assuming you've done all the normal stuff to try and deal with it(get rid of any notable reflective surfaces around, etc).  

There's certainly other options, but I dont know your use cases.  

I get your frustration, I hate when shit just doesn't work properly, but that's my warning with the Index here - there's a lot of potential frustrations down that road, too.  I think lack of common compatibility in whatever VR game/app you want to play would probably be my biggest issues.

6829,krelvar,t2_grqg1,"My headset used to take forever to start tracking - like upwards of ten minutes sometimes - and had lots of problems with greyouts while playing. I thought I had a bad lighthouse as well, but it turned out one of the sensors on the headset itself was bad. I'd disconnected one lighthouse when trying to track it down, and the headset would connect quickly and track perfectly, as long as I was facing away from the active lighthouse. The sensor below my left eye was screwy. I covered it with electrical tape and since then it's been rock solid, and that includes using tpcast wireless.

Maybe worth some experimenting - tracking that down was one of the most frustrating things I've ever dealt with computer-wise and I've been around a while. :)

3. Make sure there is enough space free even after all software installed 25 gb+

Get fpsVR on steam (it's cheap) and find out if any of your games have a cpu bottleneck. If you turn up game details *and* also reduce SS (i.e. make sure the GPU is not limiting fps, while loading the cpu) you should get a good idea.

6855,Peteostro,t2_i0b4q,"There is certainly no were near as much VR content that is being release compared PC games and consoles. You have literally 100‚Äôs of games released every day on those platforms. It‚Äôs to the point that there is no way you could play all them even if you want to. With so many games you have a few each week that are very good and worth playing. We are awash in 2d content.

If you look at steam there are 1 or 2 VR titles released almost every day. Most of it is shovel ware. But we are getting something worth playing at least once a month. So there is a good amount of content. Just stuff that is not the highest quality, or might not hit a genre that every one is interested in.

We are not going to get the 30-100 million games until we have 100‚Äôs of millions of hmd‚Äôs (most big 2d titles come out on all platforms)

It‚Äôs just a fact the current hmd‚Äôs (and hardware needed to run them) while cheaper than before are still too expensive (though getting better with the quest), skepticism still abounds (this has improved a lot in 2019) and AAA titles are not there every month. You also have to remember most people already have a gaming device, so this is also a deterrent in buying yet another gaming device.

We are getting there but it‚Äôs going to take a while. Even if we had the perfect HMD we would still be in the chicken and the egg problem.

I think part of the problem with these sorts of things is that it's still early in VR's timeline to try to make money with something that will probably depend on a userbase in the millions.  Even if we've got millions of VR users out there now, you won't have all of them interested enough to try it.

I never tried it because it sounded way too personal for me.  I wasn't interested in hanging out with a handful of strangers in someone else's apartment feeding their dog.  It sounds cool and all, but it sounds cool for someone you're close with to me.

7286,jfalc0n,t2_7kw4x,"In that case, you might want to determine what is important for you.  The Oculus Quest, for example, is completely self-contained but is getting a cable to allow it to be tethered to a PC and play Oculus titles with great graphics.

The Vive has similar visuals to the original Oculus Rift, but a different tracking system altogether.  The Vive and Rift are 1st-generation VR HMDs.  WMR (Windows Mixed Reality, Microsoft's lead) headsets like the Lenovo Explorer, Samsung Odyssey (two editions) and the HP (including the newer Reverb) came after.

WMR seems to have fallen by the wayside for consumer VR; Vive, Vive Pro, and Vive Cosmos (in that order from HTC) Oculus Rift and Oculus Rift S (from Oculus) and Valve Index (from Valve) seem to be the pretty much the de-facto consumer-based HMDs that are tethered to a PC.

Aside from the classic phone-holders, the Oculus Go and Oculus Quest are the newest self-contained mobile HMDs (by Oculus) with the Quest being the best offering for it's 6DOF, mobility and decent tracking.

7289,jfalc0n,t2_7kw4x,"Well, you have a capable PC.  Oculus Quest goes for $399 or $499 (same system only different storage capacity).  The Quest will be able to link to the PC for tethered play for better visuals soon.

However, the Quest does have immersive visuals on its own and while you'll need a cell phone (and internet connection) to set it up, it's the most portable solution out there right now.  To be honest, I use my Quest more than my Vive because it's so mobile.

However, if you just want to dedicate one space to play, don't mind being tethered to the PC (perhaps paying for wireless later) and want to spend as little as possible, I'd go for the refurbished Vive.

As the market grows and certain fragments evolve (Oculus had already started with its exclusive content and time exclusives), but Oculus does have some of the best-curated content, while SteamVR has a reasonable amount of shovelware to hit the store.  Fortunately, we're already more than 3-years in and there are some pretty good ratings on established VR content for SteamVR.

I understand the complications; simplest thing, come up with a wishlist of what you want in a VR headset and see which points match what are already out there. :)",1573875157,f7mvnx6,t1_f7muvhy,/r/Vive/comments/dwz9ly/is_the_original_vive_good_for_a_starter/f7mvnx6/,1,Vive,comment

7353,enarth,t2_y6aq3,"So first of all, can see clearly up to to 2m away IRL ? if she can she doesn't need to wear glasses in the HMD.

Secondly, the lenses are made with a circular sweetspot (where is it clear) at the center. So having the top part blurry would mean the sweetspot is too low, try finding the right position without using the strap first. You have to know that the sweetspot is pretty small, you have to find the right position by looking straight, and finding the edges of the blurriness, for example if when you look straight the upper middle part is blurry, move the headset up until you find the lower middle part blurriness and then get in the middle of these, you can do the same for the IPD, but it is way more subtle... so i would suggest measuring it)

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, there is a possibility that what your friend perceive as ""blurry"" is just the natural resolution of the HMD. The sweetpost is not 4K clear, especially if you try to look at things close to your face.. to find the sweetspot i usually use the bright chaperone boundary lines",1573898393,f7ne8xh,t3_dx3l0q,/r/Vive/comments/dx3l0q/vive_blurry_for_friend_with_glasses/f7ne8xh/,1,Vive,comment

7366,yetausern,t2_e1fr2hp,"While objects in VR may appear closer, the images generated by the goggles lenses and screens are effectively projected a few meters away.  The apparent distance is achieved by having different images for each eye.  The user does not need to accommodate their eyes to different distances as one does in natural scenes.

This means that, if the user is nearsighted, he/she has to use their corrective lenses to be able to accommodate to a distance of a few meters.  This also means that one does not need reading glasses to see ""near"" objects in VR since, optically, they are not near.

I was going to pick that up (UK) when it dropped in price a bit but I got a deal on a Vive I couldn't resist so am using that until my eventual upgrade. (I live in the UK and I got it at a US price which is why the deal was so good for me). Either way I think the index is the way to go, not only is everything just improved in general but man, those controllers. They make me tempted to just wait for boneworks even tho it looks so good just because of full knuckles support, maybe even an upgrade to those controllers before you get the full kit would be the most viable upgrade? If that's even possible. I say this because it seems there aren't to many straight up upgrades (a few compromises though) aside from the index (I mean I guess the Vive pro is but that's not even a a massive upgrade) so it seems there aren't many logical upgrades. Maybe the deluxe audio strap could help your experience (I love mine).

7391,RojasTKD,t2_10s8bx,"Yes, kinda. But it it won't be as good for PC VR than the Rift S which has native PCVR support. It might be closer enough to not really matter for most people, but we won't know for sure until it actually and we can try it on various games.

Oculus Link renders everything on the PC at a lower resolution than the Native Quest screen, foveates the image, compressed it, them seems it to the Quest to be decompressed. There is a cost to this process:

1. latency
2. A softer image

Again, may or may not make a meaningful difference. Some fast actions games may not perform as well.

If I'm playing PCVR, personally I'd rather use a Rift S, especially if I can get one for $350 over Black Friday/the holidays. If portability is important to you, then the Quest might be you choice.

**Propaganda:**

&gt;Crunch Element is a physics-centered VR infiltration game where the player can  siege compounds in whatever play style suits them. Whether that‚Äôs scaling walls quietly with a suppressed pistol taking the roof entrance, or using a breaching charge as a hole-puncher-for-walls with a  sawed-off on the hip, Crunch Element‚Äôs goal is to give the player as much freedom as possible and allow them to express themselves through  whatever play style suits them. Many of these play styles are complemented by the flagship mechanic of destructible walls, doors, and  floors. My goal is to include the community in the development process as much as possible by allowing early hands-on testing and considering  player feedback at every step of the way.

[Vive display isn't working](/r/Vive/comments/dx9tne/vive_display_isnt_working/) by  LtGray6


 I could use some help here - I've been using the Vive for 2 months and it's been fine, no issues (or very minor easy ones), but then all of a sudden, the inner display in the headset stopped working. Everything else works, the tracking, the LEDs are all green, and the display mirror on the PC shows it's moving, tracking with no issues. I just can't see anything in the headset, it's black.  


Do you think its the HDMI inside of the headset?

[PC For Wireless Without Black Screens](/r/Vive/comments/dxa1sr/pc_for_wireless_without_black_screens/) by  krogenit


Hello. I have issues with black screens on my system: Vive Pro, MSI Z370 Gaming Plus, i7 8700k, 32 gb 3200mhz, Thermaltake TR2 700W 80+ Bronze, 1080ti. I readed a lot threads with that problem and i think PC with Ryzen will works better or AMD users have black screens too? Also i think that black screens on Vive less frequently as on Vive Pro. So i'm asking Vive Pro users.

If you playing wireless without black screens completely at all, i just want to know what's you PC components, mobo, cpu and psu?

 I have fan on the top of adapter and i'm using new USB cable for connecting adapter to powerbank. I tried everything except different PC and maybe my power supply not powerful enough.

7789,SemiActiveBotHoming,t2_13y9whqw,"As someone who owns (and has fairly extensively used) both, I'd recommend you get the Rift S, with a couple of exceptions:

* The Vive can handle unusual IPDs much better than the Rift S - if you're IPD is within range it'll be fine, but if not that will be a problem.
* If you intend to (within, say, six months) upgrade to the Valve Index you should get a Vive - though IMO if you want and can afford the Index just get that.

The Vive was an *excellent* system back in 2016. It's been three years, and I cannot reasonably say the same thing about it now.

Keep in mind that HTC has actually discontinuted it, and is no longer producing the original Vive (the Vive Pro is still in production though).

Every modern headset - the Valve Index, Oculus Quest and Rift S, HTC Vive Cosmos, HP Reverb and Samsung Odyssey offer **far** superior image quality.

I bought a HTC vive on eBay (only the headset)
I plan on using Lighthouse stations with the steam index controlers I don't have the base stations jet
So I connected the vive to my PC and started steam vr the head set screen then goes white is this normal or is my head set Dead on Arrival
To be clear I don't have controls or base stations

7846,Clavus,t2_4ydw4,"&gt; but that nobody has figured out what would actually attract those numbers.

I think we have a pretty clear idea: VR needs to fullfill some core role in our everyday lives. Gaming is mostly just about entertainment, while I can see a successful VR game pulling in millions of players in another generation of hardware or two, I believe there's still a large market outside of games that'll slowly but surely adopt VR too. It is the ultimate tool for telepresence. What if you combine this with streaming of live light-field video capture? People could be present at events, meetings, and whatnot that are at the other side of the planet.

The steps we need to make with the hardware and technology are actually quite simple in concept, but will require years and years of engineering and design work.",1573835657,f7l9ipa,t1_f7l16gt,/r/Vive/comments/dw7haj/john_carmack_stepping_down_as_cto_of_oculus_to/f7l9ipa/,1,Vive,comment

&gt; **SWORDS of GARGANTUA Announces Adventure Mode Tesseract Abyss, Coming December 5**  
   
**TOKYO - November 14, 2019 -** gumi inc., and Yomuneco Inc. have announced the release date and details for the next update to VR online arena-combat action game ‚ÄúSWORDS of GARGANTUA‚Äù. The ‚ÄúTesseract Abyss‚Äù update will be free for all players on all platforms and is scheduled for release on December 5.  
   
**Introducing Adventure Mode: Tesseract Abyss**  
Tesseract Abyss puts players into the deepest layers of the 4D space known as the ‚ÄúTesseract‚Äù. By using weapons and coins earned by playing this mode, players will be able to continue into the abyss, gradually becoming stronger through equipment and abilities.  
   
**Level up your character!**  
Player rank goes up as your performance does. As your rank increases so do abilities of your choosing.  
   
**Become stronger through your abilities!**  
You can use your earned coins to strengthen your abilities, such as overall HP or your strength.  
Therefore, the more you play Tesseract Abyss the further you can progress!  
   
**Increase your strength through weapon smithing**  
You can combine duplicate weapons to make stronger versions of themselves. Depending on your strategy, you can collect and strengthen a lot of weaker type weapons or earn more powerful weapons later on and speed up the process.  
   
**Give yourself a temporary boost through artifacts**  
Artifacts are consumable items that players can purchase for temporary buffs, such as strength or health boosts. You can purchase with your coins and bring them into battle.  
   
**Carry items with you into the abyss**  
Bring your items and weapons into battle! Up to four weapons and/or artifacts can be brought into battle.  
   
Players can test their sword-wielding skills against the mighty Gargantua‚Äôs minions:

each tracked device needs it's own radio. vive hmds have 2 built into it, one for each controller. a radio can't run more than one tracked device, so if you have two controllers and two trackers, you need 4 radios... 2 come from the vive, and 2 come as dongles with the trackers.


if you have 4 controllers, you need 4 radios, regardless of using them as trackers or not. as the hmd has 2 radios, you need 2 more, hence the dongles.

It's not saying the Vive sucks...it's just that I had one since 2016 and I wanted something better now that something better is out there.   

I also tried a WMR headset or two (Lenovo Explorer and then later an Odyssey+) and the resolution is great on both of those, but the tracking isn't as good.

7925,arleas,t2_7aqkf,"I think Pimax ships worldwide, and as for Revive, I haven't used it for that, but it was my understanding that you could actually play Oculus games without the need for revive at all.  That may have changed because I haven't been following it, but if you're heavily invested in the oculus ecosystem you might really want to consider Pimax.  

However, as for compatibility:  some games just don't seem to work on the older games, or if they do, you have to engage a special mode that eats up a bit more processing power to fix the image for the angled screens.  Modern games compensate for angled screens, but older games on older game engines expect the screens to be parallel to each other, so you have to use a ""parallel projection"" mode to get those to work right.

I'd say if you expect your headset to ""just work"" without tinkering or troubleshooting then avoid the pimax.  It does work great, but it's far from flawless and it uses an extra layer of software (Pitool) between itself and SteamVR to get it working.",1573849949,f7lxkut,t1_f7lbj3w,/r/Vive/comments/dwt19l/got_the_first_htc_viveand_i_need_advice_cause_i/f7lxkut/,1,Vive,comment

7958,ripsonfools,t2_3wkb16cp,"&gt; Sadly....valve dont want my money so i cant buy a index in canada.

It's not that simple. No one knows why Valve are not selling in Canada currently but since the manual (at least my Index manual) references Canada in the warranty terms, it'll be out there sooner or later.  

&gt;  is the vive comos worth it? 

Absolutely not. It's overpriced crap. 

&gt; got a lot of comments about the rift or the quest as a better choice.

They're not but each to their own. 

&gt; Need some help! is the upgrade not big enough that i keep my htc vive ? 

The Index is. Everything else is not. 

The Rift-S is a sidegrade, not an upgrade from a Vive. Quest is it's own thing and not really something a PC VR gamer should be considering as a main PC VR headset, Cosmos is way over priced and the Win MR headsets are really good for sim pit players but not roomscale.    


&gt; can i use rift controllers with my htc vive?

No.



Everyone will have their own opinion and mine is that your best solution is to wait for the Index to launch in Canada. It will sooner or later as I said. At that point, you'll be able to just upgrade the headset and controllers or just the headset if you wish and use the rest of your Vive kit with it. Everything else you mentioned is a downgrade on tracking or not worth the price when you could, like I said, just buy an Index if you wait.",1573854386,f7m4ck2,t3_dwt19l,/r/Vive/comments/dwt19l/got_the_first_htc_viveand_i_need_advice_cause_i/f7m4ck2/,1,Vive,comment

7980,paulcnyc,t2_1zcst074,"I've just gone through all the research for this, as I have an OG Vive with the DAS, but after 3 years of solid use it's starting to get a bit shabby. Basic outline of the latest choices:  


Vive Cosmos: Sounds interesting with no lightboxes and a PC-grade inside-out tracking headset (no base stations) that can take a wireless module. But I've only heard problems with it and it's not current ""best"" at anything.  


Quest: Sort of like a Gear VR-level unit but with inside-out tracking.  


Index: Best FOV (which to me is a bigger deal than screen door), reportedly best picture of them all because each pixel has full RGB subpixels, which apparently makes a visible difference and completely eliminates screen door effect (I can't confirm this first-hand. Yet.) Plus, it'll work with your light boxes and wands if you want to just get headset only which will be cheaper. Audio is amazing. Downside, no inside out tracking, no wireless, at least for the foreseeable future.  


So everything's some form of tradeoff. I just ordered the index; headset only is sold out at this time so I'm getting the set with controllers and using the light boxes I have. I'm with Ripsonfools on this: either wait until you can get your hands on an Index or see if you can get it some other way; I saw in another thread that there was site someone used a site to get it overseas; apologies for not remembering the name but some research should dig it up.

You are definitely rolling multiple pairs of dice hoping an egpu configuration will work with a VR headset. It's not a supported configuration. A headset still having birthing pains makes it more risky to get fancy in a setup.

Look at video reviews of the Cosmos and you will see the tracking with hand positions needed for serious shooters is completely broken.

If you are looking for a not-facebook travel friendly headset with quality parity to your Rift I would look at Samsung Odyssey. Of course researching to  seeif if those WMR headset drivers puke with egpu.

For me there is no way back after this Mod, god rays almost nonexistent right now and image much more clear than before. SDE became a little bit noticeable with GearVR lens and there is some barrel distortion, but I am perfectly fine with this.

Another option to consider is the Quest, especially if you want to have portability. It will get a Link cable soon which means it will double as a PC headset. I would recommend waiting for reviews of that though.

You have a point about the controllers, something doesn‚Äôt seem right that they need to emit that much light to be tracked well.

1 - using game ( application ) rendering window

Using option 1 may impact your performance and I've notice some stuttering. Off course this depends on the game.  
It's nothing more than rendering game on 2 hi-res screens at the same time.  


Option 2 is to use Steam VR display mirror (option in steam VR) it can run in full screen and it's nothing more than just direct mirror of what's displayed in your VR.  Briefly speaking it works in the same way as playing a movie while playing game. No rendering happens, at least not as much as in case of option 1.

I'll try to help and let's see it this works.  


\- Since steam VR updates itself via Steam maybe some of the settings got corrupted. Sometimes you just need to reinstall Steam VR, especially you WANT to reinstall VR runtime.

\- Disable   Steam theater setting if enabled. That often makes games crash  
\- Disable STEAM BETA participation if enabled, sometimes that may cause some issues, especially after STEAM update.

\-Another thing is Direct X. I assume your problem is only related to VR, while same games work on monitor ?  
If not it would be worth to reinstall Direct X.

8347,ruke25,t2_176fbe,Ok this is not exactly what you asked. But I left the cv1 to get a vive pro. I bought a vive used for the sensors and controllers. Than bought the vive pro HMD.  I was originally set on a Index HMD but it was out of stock. I got a used vive pro for cheaper used anyway. Tracking is a huge improvement to the cv1. I also ordered the gear mod and put it in my OG vive while i waited for my vive pro. Sure their is the screen door but it looked way better than the CV1. When i recieved my vive pro it was great. It was way better with the gear mod. I do not even plan on getting a index HMD at this point. I keep seeing issues with the rift s. Some people have had to get replacements and the issues still exist. so they repeat and repeat. Rift s is great if it works for you. But the tacking well not be as good. Still playable but not as good. I got my vive pro setup for about $700. plus gear mod was $60. That is close to your Cosmos cost. The vive setup came with DAS for the original setup. Great deal. Plus i have a backup headset if my vive pro breaks  and with the gear mod i was really happy with the original vive honestly. I think this is a better route. return that shit.,1573730096,f7h2ckd,t3_dw3pno,/r/Vive/comments/dw3pno/just_ordered_vive_cosmos_just_read_the_complaints/f7h2ckd/,1,Vive,comment

With use-cases I meant more on the lines of ""what you intend to play/use it for?"", because the recommendations are very different for flight/driving simulators for example.

If you want a good PC based ""can do anything"" setup, the decision is realistically between the Index and the Rift-S. 

However the Quest is also worth considering, it gets a Link cable soon that will allow it to be used also as a PC headset. If portability is something you woul value, the Quest really has no competition as of yet.

8478,TomC69,t2_qpbs6ed,"Update; 

Getting a proper QC3.0 wall charger has helped quite a bit.  I'm now getting \~ 2 hrs runtime and \~3 hours to recharge.

Actually, low light with wireless now seems a lot better with 1.0.8.1.   I did get one low light warning but this disappeared pretty fast and did not seem to effect the quality of my visuals = still very good.  Maybe the power saving disable option that appeared with this update (and I enabled) helped. 

	Aside #1;  Just for fun I tried using the 18W battery that came with the old wireless kit.  Fully charged (4x green lights, not blue like the 21W) I got \~30-45 minutes of runtime before it stopped working properly = blank headset screen.  So, not completely useless and at least I can still use this to charge things like my iPhone,. Once I get my new (kinda expensive because I needed to buy another Cosmos adapter kit) 21W battery I should be fine with hot swaps. 

	Aside # 2; I found wrapping the headset/wireless cable one turn around the headband behind the left earphone helped get rid of the rear slack.  I used the little Velcro strap that came with the very long wireless battery lead to help keep this in place and I have not noticed any problems or noticed any discomfort.  

	Aside# 3;  I found using the Link Box USB cable (L1, which you do not need once you go wireless btw)) to connect to the wireless battery works very well.  It is a lot shorter but still reaches my front shirt pocket or right pant belt no problem.  It also seems to be a better quality lead so maybe it is a bit more efficient, but I don't really know for sure.  A lot better than the long thin wireless battery lead imho.  I also like not having to use the Cosmos link Box and power adapter.  Makes for a nicer, cleaner installation and frees up one DP port on your GPU.",1573760960,f7ikb62,t1_f7dezow,/r/Vive/comments/dvkkhu/mrtv_wireless_kit_for_vive_cosmos_how_good_is_it/f7ikb62/,1,Vive,comment

There's also the problem of dirty screens. Okay, simple, just wipe it clean before using right? No, you gotta clean the gear lenses both sides and the phone screen.

8538,eightarms,t2_vdjqt,"I bought the Cosmos, but sent it back because the Reverb has sooo much better resolution (better than most headsets actually). However, the Cosmos is not nearly as bad as a lot of people are making it out to be. It worked well enough in a lot of games. The only thing that I was annoyed with was getting messages for low light or too bright light. Those were lessened after updates. However, I could play stuff like Eleven ping pong and various other games without much issue. I did not use it for rifle shooting or bow and arrow games though. 
The pluses were a good screen, good colors, good sound, flip-up visor (no I never noticed much light getting in because of that), lots of room for glasses, comfort, manual ipd adjustment, decent refresh rate, decent controllers. 
I will say the small sweet spot was a tad annoying, but actually improved when I put glasses on, and the headphones were not easy to snap into place. 
If you need really solid tracking, it's not the headset to get right now. And really, the price is only really worth it if you plan to use wireless. But it is still cheaper than the Index without the wireless, and more portable too, so there's that. If they fix the tracking, then the headset becomes quite reasonable.",1573783919,f7jqg5v,t3_dw3pno,/r/Vive/comments/dw3pno/just_ordered_vive_cosmos_just_read_the_complaints/f7jqg5v/,1,Vive,comment

8773,TomC69,t2_qpbs6ed,"I‚Äôve had my Cosmos wireless adapter kit for a week now.  Overall I agree with mrtv‚Äôs review.  Easy to install and worked fine first time.

The short Headset cable is much too long.  It probably should be at least 30% shorter.  I found pulling some slack between the left headphone and visor helped get rid of most of the rear hanging slack.

The battery life is pretty short, for me about 1.5 hours.  Plus it took me 4 hours to recharge using a 5v/2A wall charger.  I have ordered a QC3.0 18w wall charger so this should speed up recharging and maybe give a deeper/fuller charge.  In any case I will need to source out an additional QC3.0 21W battery so I can do fast change outs.

While the performance of the wireless kit is very good it does use some cpu resources.  The only app that this causes a problem for me is with X Plane 11.  This is a very cpu intense sim and currently does not support multi threading.  Hopefully this will improve over the next few months as xp11 moves to Vulcan.  In the meantime I need to drop xp11 settings down quite a bit in order to maintain acceptable FPS.  I may try upping my current i9 9900k OC ( currently 5 GHz to maybe 5.1-5.2).  I may also increase my gtx1080ti OC (currently +80 core, +160 memory).

Also, Quest is very front heavy and it would require much more ergonomic halo strap to be comfortable (if it would work at all). As it is, it doesn't come close to Rift S level of comfort. It made my forehead hurt in around 15 minutes of use and I went back to my original strap + studioform strap setup right away. It's much better.

I was somewhat thrilled when I saw a company [Immersion](https://www.immersion.com/technology/) working on software called Haptic Studio, but never really saw something generally available for hobby developers.

What would be nice is to have a collection of tried and true haptic assets that can be applied to various interactions within a VR application.

I remember one of the best experiences with haptic feedback was Valve's original VR tutorial for SteamVR;  the haptic sensation when blowing up balloons was surreal.

But if you don't see yourself doing that, I would honestly just pick the Vive, especially if you can get it on sale as well. Definitely pick up the Deluxe Audio Strap - that thing is basically a necessity.

A lot of people don't seem to mention this, but you can use the Valve Index Knuckles controllers and then get the Index at a later date. The lighthouses that come with the Vive work with the Knuckles/Index.

So if I was to buy a headset knowing this, I would still opt for the Vive. As Output mentioned, definitely get the GearVR lenses at an absolute minimum before upgrading. - it makes the halo effect very minimal while making things easier to read, along with better clarity.


TL;DR - Get the Vive, consider the GearVR lense mod at a minimum. Upgrade to the Valve Knuckles controllers and then if you're still invested into VR, upgrade to the Index and keep your lighthouses.",1573665448,f7eth52,t1_f7estn3,/r/Vive/comments/dvtdjz/hows_the_vive/f7eth52/,1,Vive,comment

Cons:

Comfort wise if you dont buy the DAS is pretty lame...

Controls are day and night worse than Oculus... (you can buy a pair of Index controllers but that adds to the total cost with already is elevated)

You have to set up the lighthouses and you cannot use the Vive in other place unless do the same setup in that place (wich can be tedious). This compared with te Rift S wich have no external sensors.

It have more Screendor Effect (due to the wider FOV I think), and the Sweet Spot is worse thank Oculus CV1 (and in the Rift S is better)

Pros:

Tracking is excelent (hadn't tryed Rift S to compare)

FOV is wider, this is a plus to immersion and the thing that I noticed first when I bought my Oculus CV.

I don't notice SDE the way I do with the OG Vive; the colors of each pixel are very separated. Vive is by far my least favorite headset to look through, but obviously the best to track if I'm doing something like mixed reality capture or TiltBrush recording. Original elastic straps make it unnecessarily front-heavy and with the Deluxe Audio strap, while it's greatly improved, it's too much weight vs PSVR for me personally (6'2"", big noggin). So if I'm sitting in to watch a movie or a live YouTube broadcast, I will sit on the couch with PSVR.

Seriously. Once you've tried others, it's night and day.

If you want something cheap, get an oculus. If you can stretch higher, I recommend the Pimax, and if you want the absolute pinnacle right now, the valve Index.

Note: There is no perfect VR headset out there right now (but damn, the valve index is close). Each has its strengths and weaknesses, so please PLEASE ask this question on other vr subs (like r/oculus r/SteamVR or r/Pimax) ; each sub is full of fans who will defend their headset of choice to the death and obstinately deny any flaws it has, so its important you get a better view of the playing field, and really listen to the particular strengths and weaknesses of each)",1573674185,f7f7xja,t3_dvtdjz,/r/Vive/comments/dvtdjz/hows_the_vive/f7f7xja/,1,Vive,comment

Then I played the Quest version. There is a jump and crouch button, which deals with the biggest UI challenge adapting a traditional FPS. Then we have a reach-behind-your-back to grab the crowbar, swing to smash, aim down the iron sights, physically throw grenades ... it's pretty damn smooth.

Now, it's all subjective, but I really like the new approach that Oculus is taking: affordable, but still quality PC VR hmd and mainstream pushing mobile VR, that I think is the right way forward for VR.

For cutting edge PC VR you have Valve and (to some degree) hmds like HP Reverb, etc.

9311,ripsonfools,t2_3wkb16cp,"&gt;  I dont want to support valve by buying an index.

You know..you could just say ""I don't want to buy an Index"" but you had to push an agenda. Once that is about to backfire in your face as well. 

You buy an original Vive, it's built with Valve tech and will only work with SteamVR. Sure you can use Viveport and get ReVive so you can use Oculus home but then what? There will always be games that only release on Steam. Even if you buy a WinMR headset instead, Microsoft has a partnership with Valve for game support. 

One way or another, you buy anything but a Rift-S / Quest or content outside of Oculus home, you will be supporting Valve in some manner.

So by your own ""I don't want to support Valve"" comment, you've locked yourself into one choice of headset and one choice of store front only.  Have fun with that because Oculus want to be as exclusive and locked in as theyt can be anyway and Facebook seem like such good guys with their end users best interests as their number one agenda... right?",1573554476,f7b3y8t,t3_duzxlm,/r/Vive/comments/duzxlm/htc_vive_or_rift_s/f7b3y8t/,1,Vive,comment

9371,mattbnn,t2_jcjhc,"Hi there! This is the GameBoom VR team!Throughout  2019, we worked on our game, which is the virtual reality port of Thief  Simulator. From the first day of production, we knew what we wanted to  strive for. Thief Simulator VR is a production that is not a lazy port  where the player only gets the option to move his head in the game  world. The entire title originally created by Noble Muffins has become a  virtual world in which you can catch and lift almost any object.

Thief  Simulator VR will allow you to play the role of a thief who carries out  the orders of a mysterious man named Vinny... But this does not mean  that we force the player to perform story missions. Thief Simulator VR  offers a lot of fun:  
\- fully-immersive  realistic mechanics in VR. Feel how it is to lock pick doors, smash everything in a house, steal cars, jump through windows and hide in a  trash  
\- disassembly stolen cars, hack phones and tablets in your hideout; and sell all goods in a pawn shop or by online  
\- buy new thief tools and gadgets that will allow you to rob richer people  
\- drive cars with fully implemented VR-adapted driving model and play with a car interior  
or  just‚Ä¶ follow a plot and pay off a debt to a mysterious family or choose by yourself which house you will rob next in this free roam sandbox  world.

Thief  Simulator VR is not a short VR game. We estimate that production can be  completed in 10 hours, but when we consider the freedom of what players  can do in this world - some can spend up to 100 hours on this title.  Price? Only $15. 

Thief  Simulator VR has its premiere today. We decided that we want to spend  this time here as well because the Reddit community eagerly commented on  our recordings from early versions of the game and suggested  interesting tips. Here we are! Let's start AMA!",1573583505,f7c3cx5,t3_dve21x,/r/Vive/comments/dve21x/thief_simulator_vr_is_out_now_ask_us_anything_guys/f7c3cx5/,1,Vive,comment

Or even being able to go behind and choke someone out, being able to hack cctv cameras, disable them etc. Basically making it sort of similar to hitman w/o killing ppl :D, I think adding loads more mechanics like these will really help the replay-ability factor.

9401,mattbnn,t2_jcjhc,"Hi,

if you mean early beta. Than we have improved in every area including performance, anti-motion-sickness options and ""easiness"" (is that a word?) of play.

We still continue to work on these area of course, since there is are for improvement. You can always refund the game if you don't like it or it makes you puke :)

Here are comforting solutuibs that we have:

TUNNELING [all options in Graphics tab]:

You can turn on and off anti-motion-sickness effect Tunneling separately for:
Tunnelling during walking
Tunnelling during rotating
Tunneling on window leap
Tunnelling effect coverage - additionally you can set the sensitivity of the effect

LOCOMOTION [all options in Movement tab]:

We provided you also with many locomotion options (Touchpad/thumbstick, Armswing, Headboob, Teleport)
Additionaly, when moving with touchpad/thumbstick you can choose whether you will walk accordingly to head, body or controller direction. The speed of movement increases linearly with thumbstick/touchpad input.
If you feel like the touchpad/thumbstick movement is still too fast you can use Walking speed factor [0.2:1]


DRIVING:

Control steering wheel with thumbsitck / touchpad [Settings]- should be easier on your stomach and it easier to master.

Lock pitch and roll when driving [Gameplay] - should help you a lot while driving. You won‚Äôt feel like being on a rollercoaster",1573593268,f7ciy8a,t1_f7ceisk,/r/Vive/comments/dve21x/thief_simulator_vr_is_out_now_ask_us_anything_guys/f7ciy8a/,1,Vive,comment

9460,SmartM0nk3y,t2_11cfl3,"Hi! I am stoked this is released! I have been following it ever since I bought it on the switch, my question is this the switch version is extremely lacking in updates vs the pc version, no junkyard/van etc. What is included in this version and will you plan on updating it regularly?",1573608132,f7d5i2c,t3_dve21x,/r/Vive/comments/dve21x/thief_simulator_vr_is_out_now_ask_us_anything_guys/f7d5i2c/,1,Vive,comment
