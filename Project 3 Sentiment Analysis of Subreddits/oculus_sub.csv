Like I'll be turning my head and the screen hangs for a moment and then leaps forward like 30 degrees of rotation to catch up \*barf\*.  


Even trying to hold my head still in passthrough model the screen sometimes jumps to the left or right.

So with it being the holidays I have my hopes set on picking up a new headset. I currently have a CV1 that’s been gathering a bit of dust but I feel that it’s time to get back into some of the VR experiences I’ve been putting off.

I was originally planning on selling/giving away my CV1 and upgrading to one of the newer sets (Quest or Rift S) but am now considering a new path. I do like the idea of untethered VR but not without sacrificing the PCVR experience I’ve come to know and love. 

My question is, would you recommend the Quest and to hold onto my CV1 for the exclusive titles and better tracking/lower latency or should I just go all in on the Quest or Rift S? (I should caution that I do appreciate visuals, but prefer tracking, performance, and quality of experiences more)

Sorry for the huge wall of text and I’d love to hear some accounts from people who have made the jump and whether they felt like the CV1 can keep up with these new guys (especially curious with Link just having released, has made searching for a decision a little challenging with such dated info out there)

So I finally splurged and bought a wrestling grade mat for my VR area.  It makes a big difference.  This is the Meister X-Thick 1.5 inch wrestling mat.  I've only used it for a few days but I recommend it or a comparable other mat of extra thickness. This thickness isn't only good for relieving tired feet over long sessions, but I can literally drop to my knees without pain or damage, which makes shooting games or other games that require that I kneel or crawl sometimes is not a problem. The only problem is the mat is so thick and giving that it is slightly harder to balance on.  This probably won't be a deal-breaker for anyone with normal balance, it just takes a small adjustment period.  

&amp;#x200B;

Yes it's expensive, but it can be bought in sections.  Start at the center with 10 tiles, save a few weeks, then buy another section.  A lot of people only have a mat in the center of their play area to let them know when they are getting near the edge.  Instead of going that route, I have the boundaries set a full arm's length from the walls, so staying in the center is less of an issue.",oculus,A mat makes a huge difference.,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/e4jh5l/a_mat_makes_a_huge_difference/,True,submission

I posted a similar issue a few months back that I thought had gone but it seems to have returned! I'm getting really nasty laggy/popping audio through my Rift - and only my rift. My normal headphones are fine.

I've recorded an example which shows what it's doing: [http://www.mediafire.com/file/1pyzem98qjvojkj/Desktop\_2019.11.21\_-\_19.57.25.02.DVR\_Trim\_%25281%2529.mp4/file](http://www.mediafire.com/file/1pyzem98qjvojkj/Desktop_2019.11.21_-_19.57.25.02.DVR_Trim_%25281%2529.mp4/file)

I've tried all the usual suggestions like reinstalling USB drivers, reinstalling Oculus, changing round all my USB devices, using a USB extender, changing the sound Hz quality etc etc., but nothing seems to fix it! I've got a ticket open with Oculus and we've been through the usual rigmarole, but they can't seem to fix it either.

I've narrowed down the following:

1. It's not the rift itself as the problem doesn't occur when I've tried it on my partners PC
2. I've used a Rift S on my PC and that doesn't have the issue
3. It seems to be connected with CPU usage as when this increases, the popping/lag gets worse
4. It doesn't occur at all when i'm running in safe mode

I’ve only played the Quest before, which I LOVE, but waiting for new games has been killing me, hence the new PC. With PCVR, there’s so much content already out there (I just blew a load of cash on the steam sale) so I’m good for games for months! 

Only thing is, everything I’ve got from the Oculus store is running great, but the stuff I’m playing on Steam VR is a bit of a janky mess. I’ve checked that my pc exceeds the minimum spec, but for some reason the 2 games that I tried tonight (Arizona Sunshine and In Death) were all over the place.

I’m running an i5 8400 and a gtx1060 3GB, using Oculus Link and a Quest. From all the research that I’ve done this should be enough to run these, right?

Anyway, when I run games through Oculus (Pistol Whip, Audica, Robo Recall and Brass Tactics) everything is perfect. I really have no idea about how to/what settings can be changed to optimise performance, or if there’s just something super basic that I’m missing, so if anyone can give me a bit of advice I’d be really grateful.

On a side note, Brass Tactics has to be one of the most wholeheartedly enjoyable games I have ever played in my life! Honestly, just fantastic, great job to those devs.

I'm at the point where it asks me to plug in the cords.  When I do that window disappears and after a second or two a small box appears with the Oculus logo and a spinning 'loading circle'.  I can then hear through the headset the noise of a USB device being connected and then disconnecting over and over.  It does this for awhile before the noises stop but the loading circle never leaves.  The only way to get rid of it is to close the program or kill the process.  
  
Definitely plugging the headset into the USB 3 connector and the proper connector on the video card.  I know I'm doing something wrong but I can't figure out what and I haven't been able to search anything via google that helps.

Im going to do some quick useless reviews on games Ive played because why not?

So, I got my quest on release, and have loved every second of it. Personally, for my face and headshape, its plenty comfortable--- at least for &lt;2 hour game sessions, which is enough for me. I do also own a Rift S now, which Ill get into.

Also I bought almost every game avaliable on quest. Seriously, the only ones I dont have are boxing games and the racket games. 

Im going to do some lightning reviews because I feel a big disconnect between which games I like and which are popular on here, and wanted some other opinions. Just some good friendly discussion, ya feel?

Beat Saber:
What can I say that hasnt been said? My only complaint is that loading custom songs isnt a built in feature. DLC songs are way too pricey.

Red Matter:
Best Game. As a huge fan of Myst type puzzle games, Red Matter was a perfect match for me. 0 complaints.

Pistol Whip:
Horribly over rated IMO, one of the few games Ive refunded. Feels slow, easy and unpolished to me. Levels need far more variety other than background tracks. Just not my type of game. I know its popular, but I just dont see why.

Gun Club:
Great game hampered by controls. Pistols feel great, but using both hands and aiming down sights is akward at best. Had a fair few visual glitches as well, nothing game breaking.

Moss:
*happy mouse noises*

Espire 1:
What an over hyped hunk of crap. Level design is laughably bad, ita not designed for stealth at all. AI is non existant. 'comfort theatre' is the worst comfort addition Ive experienced, and turning it off causes glitches. Another game I refunded. Maybe with some serious updates this could be good, but the overall design is just flawed.



And now, onto games for my rift S and/or Quest Link. Obviously the library for PC VR games is a lot more broad, but Ive only purchased a few PC VR exclusives.

Audica:
10/10, so good. What I was hoping pistol whip would feel like. Tons of fun, amazing music choices, IMO its tied with beat saber for best VR rhythm games.

Blade and Sandwiches:
This game is SO MUCH FUN.
It does feel more like a tech demo than a full fledged game right now, but the gameplay is so perfect ots worth the price. Best swordplay acaliable in VR that I have experienced.

Skyrim/Fallout 4 VR;
When link came out and before my S had arrived, VR Skyrim was my dream...but It was actually a nightmare. I refunded the game after countless hours modding it and only an hour of actual play. I wont go too in depth on why I hated it, but I will say games adapted to VR instead of designed for it really fail in comparison. From the terrible hand animations to a complete lack of VR exclusive features, I just hated the experience.

Lastly, Subnautica.
Same opinion as above; it doesnt feel like a VR game as much as a 3D movie. If that is your jam, then cool. But I dont play VR for 3D view, but hand freedom/physical immersion.

**Hello, everybody!**

I'm looking into buying a **Oculus Rift S**.

The problem is i'm from Serbia and it's the cheapest headset at around $712 ( *the vive is around $1k* ) and keep in mind only one shop is selling them. So because of that i was looking to order from Amazon (*uk, de,us* ). On the US Amazon website it's $349 and the only option for shipping is ""  AmazonGlobal Priority Shipping "" at $117.33. To quote Amazon "" You can track your shipment and view any applicable import fees deposit before placing your order "" does that mean there is a guarantee i will not have to pay additional import fees when it arrives?

Thank you for reading, hope someone can help me!

Rift S: - x1 LCD display, no hardware ipd, 5 cameras, controllers x2 - also $400 This should be $150-200 not $400. Considering Explorer has two displays and 2 cameras for $99 the Rift S should not cost more than $99, with controllers not more than $200.

Why does the Rift S cost $400 when it should cost $150? Given the fact Ody+ has two screens, hardware IPD and two cameras already for $220 and Rift S has half of that?

Quest also has twice the specs as Rift S and is sold for the same price.

Quest should also cost around $300, not $400, if Ody+ is $230 and all Quest has extra to ody+ is 3 more cameras, a ram and processor chip, and 64/128gb of storage.

\- Checked all the updates available for Windows, USB drivers, BIOS, Motherboard. Everything.

\-  I tried updating the USB host controller from the list and choose the Microsoft one (USB xHCI) instead of the ASmedia one it didn't work but it also gave me a 'Not Enough USB Controller Resources' error.

\-  I tried everything possible nothing worked.  
But now while I was playing with the sound settings on windows the sound coming from the rift s headset now sounds normal before it was static and fucked up.  
It still says incompatible on the oculus app and keeps refreshing every few minutes and nothing is happening other than lag spikes on my pc.

\-  I tried everything possible. I was able to get to the headset sensor check screen with an error ""Sensors can't track headset"" after uninstalling all the USB 3.0 drivers. only once tho. So I am now back to the incompatible screen again.

\-   I've been trying all USB ports and all Display ports and even moved my monitor from the Display port to HDMI and then I was able to continue with the headset setup and got everything working and active but there was nothing in the headset display only black screen.

I bought a Rift S two days ago. Every time I boot up my PC, I have this problem : [https://ibb.co/FKk6mfN](https://ibb.co/FKk6mfN) 

To fix this, I have to unplug the USB cable of the Rift S and plug it back, then it works until the next reboot.

Note that my drivers are all up to date. 

On my motherboard, I have 6 USB ports.

4 of them are  3.0 gen 1 (Intel Z370). This problem happens on all of them. My Rift S is the only thing connected to these ports, nothing else.

2 of them are 3.0 gen 2 (ASMedia). The problem does NOT occurs on these ports BUT I have constant stuttering so I can't use them.

I tried to repair the installation, it didn't fix the problem.

any idea ?

Bought a new rift s on Black Friday and a new gigabyte 2060 super from micro center today.

Got  everything up and running except my third monitor is a mounted tv on my  wall and my second monitor is an older hdmi monitor and then just for  reference my main monitor is a g sync 144hz dpi connected monitor.

With my old card I had multiple hdmi ports but with my new one i just have 3 dpi and one hdmi ( and one usb-c I think)

Well  so here’s my problem. When I have my ideal setup plugged in, dpi main  monitor, oculus dpi, second monitor hdmi, third monitor hdmi with hdmi  to dpi adapter and everything is up and running my second monitor ( hdmi  port, not the one with adapter )  starts blinking and my oculus doesn’t  want to connect.

When I unplug my third monitor (one with dpi adapter ) everything runs fine I just can’t use my third screen.

Tried  a couple different configurations to troubleshoot and the adapter  doesn’t seem to be the issue because it doesn’t matter which hdmi port  it’s plugged into or which screen, whichever is plugged into the hdmi  port on the graphics card starts flickering if all 4 things are plugged  up.

Uninstalled and reinstalled  drovers, updated bios, and a few other config things but I’m open to  suggestion... could it be a power supply issue, bad card, or still  adapter issue somehow? Open to any suggestions and further clarification  if needed.

long time CV1 owner, now Rift S owner. I love this one except the sound.

I saw several mods and accessories. I would like to know which solution gives a sound as good as CV1 (which is very very good).

It seems the bionick don’t sound that good. I saw the Koss mod but I doubt  $20 headphones will sound great...

For instance, when I am in a party with a friend on the Quest and my wife is playing the Rift, all three of us seem to be in the party together, and even when I'm not in a party on the Quest and my wife is in the Rift my microphone doesn't seem to work in-game or it sounds all roboty. Conversely, if me, my wife and a friend want to play a game together it only works with games that have a separate login (like RecRoom) and even then it can get kinda buggy.  So I guess I have a few questions:

1. Is there a way to easily switch between different accounts on the Quest? 
2. When two headsets are active on the same account is there anything I can do so that parties work with just one of the headset?
3. Is it advisable to simply have a different account for each headset? If so, what's the deal with crossbuy games?

For what it’s worth I pre-ordered the original Rift the hour it was available, and I loved it, but after experiencing wireless I really see no point in going back to a wire despite graphical differences. This is because I know the visual powerhouse VR games in wireless VR are probably no more than 3-4 years out. These advances in VR that we all talk about will make even the Index seem laughable by comparison.

So with all the information we have, I don’t understand why when someone just buys a Rift S, and I tell them that Oculus quite frankly doesn’t want to be selling it, they get mad at ME. 

It’s just the reality of the situation we live in. No Rift S specific content is being created by Oculus. The Quest videos on Oculus’ YouTube page outnumber the Rift S videos nearly 10 fold.

Additionally the Rift S is $50 off during the holiday sale yet the Quest is still full price. (The Rift S isn’t as easy to sell)

Oculus will never release a wired PC headset ever again. It will be a dual mode headset (stand-alone and wireless to PC) that has the best of both worlds.

So just embrace the wireless inevitably that awaits you for VR, and don’t shoot the messenger 😉",oculus,"I know I can come across as arrogant, but ever since the Quest has begun the wireless VR “revolution” some people really get upset with me when I say the Rift S is not Oculus’ focus, and was only released to appease certain crowds.

I've done my research and decided if I want to buy a VR headset now I'd go for the Rift s over quest as I'm only interested in PCVR. My only concern is my IPD I measured at 58 which is at the very edge of their suggested range. I've googled my IPD with rift s and noticed a fair few people have had issues with eye strain or said it was unplayable for them.

I live in Sydney, Australia and there's no place I can test the headset before I buy. If I decide to just bite the bullet and buy it is there a return policy from Oculus if I get eye strains / it's unplayable for me? I've also heard Amazon have a good return policy so maybe that's an option for me. I won't get the black friday sale but atleast have my returns covered in the event its unplayable for me.

From what I read, Oculus Rift S and Oculus Quest+Link seem to be the best entry level options. But genuinely, if theres another brand I should consider based off my four points, please let me know.

Oculus Rift S beats the Quest in like all aspects from what I can tell besides the portability and the fact you can manually set the IPD, and the comfort is pretty poor even with ""mods"" from what I have heard. I dont value portability, I really value the comfort of the strap I'd imagine, and I'd really value seeing well. And apparently theres people that have been ok with an IPD of 56 and people that have returned it with an IPD of 59 so what do I know. I've also read that people can say the Rift S looks good, but with the adjustment from Quest, the Quest looks even better, like they were missing out on things in the Rift S. I dont know how I'd know that. I also wouldnt know how to tell if I should return it, how to tell VR sickness apart from poor mismatch of the sweet spot for IPD. 

So really, with all that said...people keep saying Quest+Link is the future. Should I get it to make sure my IPD is in range? Is there a huge performance hit? Is the Quest really that uncomfortable even with mods? All of this makes me think ""Get Rift S, return it if it doesnt work for you"" but I dont know how to tell VR sickness apart from IPD mismatch.

I get that standing up will have the correct height since the floor is a baseline for where to present your head in-game, as do I know some software specifically has a 'seated mode' option to deal with this.  The core concern is that seated mode is rare and even oculus home does not have this.  Steam is good for me because I can still adjust my base height but actual oculus software... not so much.

I have followed this a bit on the oculus community forums but it tends to go nowhere.  Besides my concerns, how would anyone unable to stand (for various reasons) be able to use a Rift S?  I still have a Rift CV I am going to try out again for sake of consistent height binding but I hope there is some sort of tweak oculus-level I can apply to play seated but be presented as standing in games.

Below are some oculus community threads with one I made the other day to try and bring this topic back up.  I also searched this subreddit but did not see any resolution to directly deal with oculus software and a Rift S on the height presentation.  Please remember is it not really viable to put my controller below the floor to offset my distance from the headset in the calibration setup for a Rift S.

I made a post recently about my Rift S not working correctly anymore after change my mainboard. It restarts with static noise after a few minutes of playing, but not consistently. Yesterday I got 20 minutes H3VR out of it and today it crashed after 10 minutes RoboRecall.

I reinstalled Windows 10, all drivers are up to date, power management settings are set, I tried every USB port and even got an active USB hub to avoid power problems since I use a 5m USB repeater cable (and 5m DP extension as well). There is no other device on USB 3, just mouse, keyboard and a BT adapter on USB 2.

Still no luck.

It is capable to run VR without a problem. I have been wanting to get a VR headset for a long time now and this Christmas I'm getting money from my family and combined with some other money from my job I've saved up I have a budget of around 600$. Obviously I cant get the vive pro or index, the vive cosmos is apparently not worth it. That narrows it down to just the Quest or Rift S. 

Here is what I think might be important to deciding:

\-I have a capable PC and open connections

\-The PC can be moved easily in order to play anywhere, so cable length is not a problem 

\-My play space is kinda constricted, especially when it comes to height (I'm maybe 5'7'' and the room is about 8' or 9', enough to jump as long as my hand isn't up)

My intention is to also get the Quest and test all 3 and see which I prefer.

# Rift S vs CV1

**Text -** This is so sharp,  feels like reading it off a webpage. Going back to the CV1 text looks blurry it is a night and day difference. Immediately made my CV1 feel dated in this regard.

**God rays** \- I still feel these are present but nowhere near as bad as the CV1.

**Blacks -** Definitely noticeable going from OLED to LCD, the blacks are much brighter( closer to dark grey)  doesn't bother me too much ties in with my next point.

**Clarity -** Everything does feel sharper but I had a harder time distinguishing this because once you get immersed in a game you stop noticing it as much (at least I do). The perceivable difference is much less the further you are looking into the distance.

**Audio** \- Definitely the only downgrade in my opinion however, It doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I actually see it as a potential positive to the longevity of the Rift S because I get to choose which headset I use and its another user replaceable part. 

**Comfort -** No contest in my opinion,  Rift S is much more comfortable and I never had any issue with the CV1 . The rubber nose part seems to remove the ability to see the floor which definitely helps with immersion. 

**Build Quality -** I hear a lot of people say the Rift S build quality is inferior to the CV1. I feel like there is no basis to this, I think its purely because there is more plastic than the CV1 headset its perceived as ""cheaper"". Everything feels sturdy but still lightweight.

**Tracking -** Coming from a three sensor setup I was abit worried here however, I noticed no tracking issues what so ever and I think the convenience of not having the cables running around my room outweighs any potential downfalls I've yet to discover.

**IPD:** Im still tinkering with this but I used the lowest setting on the CV1, I left it on default but did try change it in the settings however it didn't seem to make it look any different to me.

**Controllers :**  The new controllers are much lighter and feel smaller, They are comfortable but I have to say the CV1 controllers feel more robust. I can definitely see them potentially splitting if you hit them hard enough.

Finally one thing I did notice was my CV1 seemed to fog up much more and was super annoying having to continually wipe the lens. This was specially noticeable in the movement games ( Beatsaber, Thrill of the fight etc)

The rubber nose insert seems to block any light and think it is stopping the headset from fogging up too.

All in all I think its not a quantum leap above the CV1 but if you can get a decent price selling your CV1 the benefits are well worth it. Not to mention removing your sensors and drawing out your boundaries through the headset.

I will provide an update when I test the Oculus Quest with and without link.",oculus,"Another CV1 owner switching to Rift S, My thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/e3kqas/another_cv1_owner_switching_to_rift_s_my_thoughts/,True,submission

The only upgrade I see here is the visual clarity and it's not a huge difference between both, maybe coming from someone who hasn't tried the CV1 it would be a great purchase but I see no point, especially if you are playing fast paced games like shooters, you need to have good sound and your tracking needs to be spot on.

If I drop the settings down to Standard it's more bearable to play however it looks significantly worse than it did on Enhanced.  I found an option in Steam VR settings that showed that the game was currently rendering at 2016x2172 per eye which I know exceeds Rift S's max resolution so I dropped it to 1336x1440 per eye which helped with the stuttering and made the game playable on Enhanced settings however the image quality was even worse then it was on Standard settings.

 Theres a difference between normal gaming on a PC for example, and gaming in VR that no one seems to be talking about. The fact that on a normal gaming system, all the work is done by the ""meat"" at the end of your wrist and your brain. Its almost similar to what dreaming is. You stand still while images flash before you. In VR however, the whole body is engaged, your senses are assaulted in every way. That also gives your brain more work to do to coordinate all that movement, which again raises your energy consumption. And the body doesnt want to do that. Its like work, we know its good for us, we know we NEED to do it, but the body fights it and deters us from doing it. The only reason this isnt happening in VR right now, is cause of the novelty. I think, once VR will be widely available and affordable, and it will pass from this novelty stage to something common, people will go back to playing games with a normal mouse, controller or keyboard and regard VR as a passing fad. Unless it evolves.        
 So let me stress the ""in its current formula"" part. There is a place for VR to be something monumental, but only if it can overwhelm the brain with endorphin in such a way, that the work you need to do is insignificant. Right now, as ive said, that is happening, but only because of the novelty. To create something that could overwhelm the senses in such a way, you need to go 100% free movement; jumping, running, falling... the works. The other way is to decrease the energy the body has to consume, by decreasing the work. The only way to do this, is to control your character in VR just by using your brain. I think thats why there are rumblings of Valve trying to develop that. They are ahead of the curve on this, and realised that is the holy grail of VR lies there.    
 I think we are 20 years away from the type of VR that can surpass gaming on a normal system. And the only way to get there is either free movement or mind controlling your game.",oculus,Why VR in its current formula is doomed to fail,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/e2wj2f/why_vr_in_its_current_formula_is_doomed_to_fail/,True,submission

They plan to make Beat Saber a lot better of course; increasing the moat around it with a deep song catalog that will be difficult for other music based games to compete with, pushing strong social features including multiplayer, and etc. I also expect them to continue to support current platforms. 

&amp;#x200B;

**But**

Locking Beat Saber to current platforms gives Quest a huge edge against whatever company ([Apple?)](https://uploadvr.com/apple-vr-2022-ar-2023/) decides to compete with Quest. That's **a very console-like** move. The one game that the average person expects to play when getting into VR is Beat Saber. If not using Beat Saber in a console-like strategy, they can at least use it as a tool for keeping emerging platforms from locking IP to their platforms. Example: Microsoft comes out with a standalone with Minecraft (probably not going to happen), if Microsoft tries to keep Minecraft from coming to Quest, Facebook threatens to keep Beat Saber from coming to their platform. It gives them leverage in bargaining. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Superhot:** No VR game so far has reached the level of fame that Beat Saber has outside of the VR space (except maybe Half Life: Alyx recently), but Superhot may be runner up. It's one of those few games that people expect to play when getting into VR. It's unique in gameplay, and aesthetic. Seems very marketable, and there's a lot that can be done that they haven't done yet. Vrchat and Rec Room are candidates for also being popular, but there's complications with purchasing those that I won't go into now. Facebook should also obtain strong IP from outside of VR for Quest, but inside of the VR Beat Saber and Superhot are king, and they are probably a lot cheaper to buy than bringing flat game IP into VR.

 Something like the Vuze XR has a 5.7k resolution but I don’t have the expertise to know how that translates into image quality.  Also with the SDE and resolution of today’s headsets will I be able to utilize that 5.7k resolution and in the future gen 2 gen 3 of headsets will this photos and videos look better or is the current resolution matched to current headsets or what you see now is what you will see on any improved headsets..

I have jitter/stutters in all my games. After troubleshooting a little I saw something strange.

The stutter happens only when I move my hands (controllers). When displaying the performance HUD with oculus debug tools, I have a constant 90fps until I move my hands. When I do this, the fps drops between 60 and 90 and it's very jerky. I stop moving my hand, solid 90 fps.

The only thing that changed is new windows updates, nvidia drivers and new Rift drivers but IDK if it's related. Pancakes games seems to be fine.

I recently upgraded from a CV1 w/ 3 sensors to a Rift S and I'm having some issues with tracking that videos and reviews (since update 1.39) suggest shouldn't be happening and am looking for suggestions of things to try.

Issue:
Whenever I hold my hands in a rifle stance, tracking for the front controller locks in place and the rear controller will sometimes slightly twitch about. This also occasionally happens when I draw a bow in Home or playing In-Death; the bow hand will lock in place and not raise to the height I want. 
Other than this, tracking is very good, even behind my ear will drawing a bow.

Playspace:
My room is well lit, there are no highly reflective surfaces in camera view and my windows are obscured by blinds. I have unplugged my CV1 and the 3 sensors and removed the batteries from my old touch controllers.
As far as I can tell everything is up to date with drivers and firmware. 

Specs:
Gtx 1060 6GB, i7 4770, 32GB of ram, windows 10.

I've just searched this sub and found suggestions of trying a PCIe 3.0 usb hub instead of a motherboard slot. I'll give this a go tonight but am looking for any other suggestions to try while I'm at it.

I'm getting more occlusion tracking issues than videos/reviews suggest I should.

Now to the issue that frustrates me the most. I play Beat Saber a lot and I noticed this right away. When I stomp my feet the whole image shakes (mostly up and down). Same but worse is when I jump.

First I though I'm wearing it wrong. So I read up on how to fit it and experimented with different ways (even used a baseball cap). But only when I started to compare side by side with CV1 I came to a conclusion it is not about the way the halo is making the fit different. I know Rift S could be a bit more wobbly when worn wrong but you can also make it stick to your face quite tight. But even then the actual image behaves differently.

What I did is compare with CV1. Made it very loose so that the HMD actually shakes a lot when you stomp or jump. But the image in CV1 stays very still/smooth when doing that!

So that brings me to a conclusion something in Rift S software / tracking is different. Looks to me that some kind of smoothing / deadzone is done very differently. While it may sound like a good thing that tracking reflects exactly what happens to HMD in case of games like Beat Saber it is actually very distracting to the point of being nauseating.

I did test with and without Public Test Channel but had the same results. Also tried couple of different USB ports (motherboard &amp; Inateck card).

What has been you experience? Is this a known issue? Did anyone found a solution to this? Is it maybe something the brain will just get used to (honestly I would love for it to be the case but I doubt that).

Controllers works fine, cables are detected and i get to the ""Continue configuration in VR"" thing to set up guardian but when i put my headset on, its pitch black, cant see anything the displays are off.

I have everything that you can think of on my pc up to date, windows 10 1903 nothing in windows update, Nvdia 441.41

usb drivers are good too, i tried puting the oculus software in the beta version too, i tried to unplug the hmd cable like oculus support says to but same thing over and over

So i also tryed with the second rift s i ordered by mistake and suprise : same thing so its defenitly a PC issue but is it software or hardware ?

And by the way, when i launch SteamVR it gives me an error ""SteamVR need to restart blablabla(475)"" and if i launch BeatSaber, i can see the game on my laptop screen and i can move my head and my controllers everything is tracked very well but its just not displayed in my headset

After seeing that the Quest has the beta going for Link so you can play your PC games, I decided to pick that up and give that a go rather than just rebuying the Rift. The hardest part of this test was finding a cable that would work while I was at best buy. I can confirm that the cables that I got work perfectly without issue! I found an Insignia USB 3.0 12ft extension cable and a 3ft Belkin USB A 3.1 to type C cable. 

The rest of the setup went, well, surprisingly simple. I installed the Oculus software on my computer, connected the cables, the PC software ran me right through a Link setup without having to install any beta software or anything.

Started out running benchmarks to see my PC is capable and had decided to get a Rift S, then found out about the IPD issue. 

My attempts to measure myself come out at about 55-56 which is theoretically outside the range of any headset.

On Monday I spent £10 and a lunchbreak at a local VR arcade. Mostly to see if I could get on with VR but it was interesting that I could see OK with all the headsets, even though they said they don't adjust them and just leave at default. Used HTC vive pro for Pcars and space pirate trainer and something more basic for the cinematic stuff. 

So now I'm definitely hooked on the tech and determined to make it work. Assuming the default Vive IPD was mid 60's I probably can use a non adjustable set but a few short sessions are different to playing long term at home.

Then to confuse matters even more I found out about quest link!

I'm mostly interested in Rally and flight sims so being tethered doesn't bother me but this looks like an option just for the lower IPD range......or is it? If the Rift S has a larger sweet spot and better display would that actually be better than being closer to ideal with the Quest if it has a narrow sweet spot? Apparently the lenses are different?

Nowhere near me even has them in stock to look at, let alone try so I'm reaching out to anyone here who can either give a technical answer or experience.",oculus,Rift S vs Quest sweet spot,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/e2lr3q/rift_s_vs_quest_sweet_spot/,True,submission

Everyone is saying that the quest is so much better but I’ve also been told that the rift s is better in other way. What I want is a system that would utilize my new pc best. Basically I want whichever one looks better in vr and tracks better. The wireless of the quest is not huge for me since I want to play pc games.

Before folks can ask- we currently do not have plans to bring Wave to Quest, *officially*. Personally, I've used the Oculus Link on my home VR machine, and I tried the Virtual Desktop + Sidequest APK Patch to try Wave. AND IT WORKS. REALLY WELL. For me anyway- I expect some folks will have different results based on their configurations and wi-fi speeds. But I wanted to give a little bit of my experience to share some hope and excitement!

I was playing Zero Caliber on the S and the controller I was holding close to my face (The end where the gun stock would usually be) just stopped being tracked several times. Because the cameras on the rift S cant see it or track it.

If you check out the steam page, BL2VR has a lot of negative feedback. A lot of that is index users who can't play the game, and vive users who had a sub-par experience with the game. 

I want to say that on the Oculus Rift (CV1) it plays great! The Touch controllers are detected properly, you have the ability to set walking via joystick rather than teleport, and the scaling is done well. 

Thats not to say it doesnt have issues. For one thing, you can't remap controls and the setup they chose is pretty wonky to get used to. Secondly, aiming isnt the best. You have a reticle which is nice, but the gones (at least at low level) still have a chance to miss. It should be noted there is a little aim assist to compensate, but personally I would have liked to see true aim without the RNG. And the biggest thing of all is that the game is now single player totally, no multiplayer component has been introduced, which is a little sad (many abilities have been changed to compensate). 

Also, I turned on smooth turning and turned off all the fish eye filters when turning...but this is the first time i've actually been a little nauseous in my 3 years of VR gaming. 

Either way, it's the Borderlands you know and love. Being able to see the characters you know in Vr is pretty cool. What really gets me is just taking my weapons out and looking at them. Might seem small to most but BL2 always had some cool looking weapons.

When one of them is connected, I get a shit load of application frame dropped when moving my controllers. When I disconnect it, no problem. Only this particular sensor. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hi,

First of all, I opened a ticket with oculus support and waiting for their answer but I asking here in case someone as already saw this.

Since last week, the performance in my games has dropped a lot for a reason I still don't know. 

After troubleshooting a little, I found out something. After enabling the performance HUD with debug tools, I saw that I have a lot of Application frames dropped.

The performance headroom is still very good. There is no compositor drop.

One thing I noticed too is that the frame rate is fairly good if I don't move my touch controllers. I soon as I move them, the drops number goes higher and higher with a lot of visual hiccups until I don't move my hands.

If I move my head only, no problem.

This problem occurs in all game, even Oculus Home.

I tried different usb ports without any effect.

But I found something interesting ! I have 3 sensors. I decided to disconnect them one by one until I realized that as soon as one of the sensors is connected, the drops begins. As soon as I disconnect it, almost no drops (still a few but less one frame here and there).

I tried this sensor in different usb ports (including the ports other sensors use) and I always have the problem.

I can have 1, 2 or 3 sensors, if one of them is this sensor, the problem begins.

If I'm not mistaken, the problem occurred after installing the last Rift drivers but I fail to see how a driver can break a sensor.

Any help would be great.

This was the set that came with the xbox one controller. I do not have the touch controllers. Steam VR DOES NOT see the xbox one controller at all and I am stuck at the press Y on your controller. I have tried my wireless dongle, then direct USB and no luck. 

The controller works fine everywhere else, including in oculus home. I have tried unchecking every controller support in Steam, rechecking it, deleting driver folders, uninstalling Steam VR, reinstalling it, nothiing seems to work for me. I even tried to hit back on the controller as suggested in the steam VR for Rift setup instructions and nothing.

If I look in the steam VR window on my desktop, it shows the headset and IR camera, but not the xbox one controller. If I go to devices and configure controller in steam vr it shows no controllers.

My Current Rift is okay, but it's lack of ""mobility"" is why I'm upgrading. The current setup time is too long, the headset is a bit uncomfrtable and the grid effect makes me sick.

- Intel i5 6600k
- GTX 1070
- 16gb Ram
- Windows 10
- SSD
- Oculus Quest

I have an Oculus Quest and I'm just getting started with Link. It works great so far, but I'm having a little trouble with performance. I bought Asgard's Wrath and on the lowest possible settings the game is just extremely jerky and stuttery. When you're standing still just looking around it runs great, but any time you move or a big character animation happens it's super jittery and it really makes the playing experience bad. This is disappointing because my specs are supposed to be enough to play a game like this. I'm probably going to return it unfortunately.

I'm wondering, outside of games that are already available on Quest, what games run particularly well on lower end machines? Either games with lower fidelity graphics, or games that are just optimized well. Normal PC gameing seems to be a bit hit or miss on my PC - well optimized games like Titanfall 2 and Doom 2016 run perfectly at 100+ fps, but other games that aren't as well optimized frequently have a lot of problems with stuttering and hitching (Subnautica is a good example of a poorly optimized game that has a lot of performance problems). I almost never have problems with just all around low framerates - it's pretty much always stuttering that gets in the way of PC gaming for me.

The halo strap makes everything more comfortable with less headset movement while playing and less feeling like your face is squished - feels more balanced on your actual head, no more light bleed below your nose, hardly any godrays, no more setting up sensors or going too far from the sensors, no more taking off your headset to adjust or see your play area or even talking to people in real life, no more need to take off your headset to do anything on your desktop, No more taking off headset to setup guardian because of the AR setup process, no more physical IPD adjustment settings being inadvertently changed during play sessions by having your face squish against the screen, way clearer display, no more default Rift headphones getting in the way but still being able to easily plug in my own headphones and have sound without headphones plugged in, steam VR is finally well integrated and also don’t need to take your headset off to switch over, no more height changing differences when switching to steam VR.

Just everything feels perfect, the way VR should be. I bought the Rift S lastnight and literally did not take the headset off for 5 hours after I put it on because I simply did not need to... to adjust anything or see my play space or dog getting in the way.

Today i come to you, with an issue that I could not resolve myself. Every time i boot up my PC, and I want to play some VR on my Oculus Rift S, i have to press **RESTART NOW**, in the Oculus software because of an software update. This happens every time I open my PC. The only way to really resolve this for me, is to restart my PC, press **RESTART NOW**, and then i magically works. (Some how?)  

I really hope you guys have a fix for this, because it's extremely annoying.

My main issue is limited space in an already crammed small apartment, so I don’t want to own both the Rift and the Quest. I don’t need both. But I love the portability of the Quest so if I could have the best of both worlds combined that would be awesome.

 Despite few of their company’s previous investors wanting to have anything to do with them, the co-founders have managed to keep things afloat thanks to personal investments from a close friend of theirs, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey.

“Nobody else will touch them but the Nazi sympathizer,” a former Upload executive told TechCrunch.

Multiple sources tell us that Luckey has personally invested as much as $2.5 million in Upload to keep the company running after it spent through the last of a $4.5 million Series A which it had raised in late 2016 from Colopl, General Catalyst and others. The Oculus founder, who left Facebook nearly one year ago following an extended controversy swirling around his personal politics, has maintained a close relationship with the company’s leadership but has been reluctant to invest further.

(Seems an insufferable fanboi named David Heaney was selected by Palmer to author several articles at Upload VR.  Later David's name being removed from several articles at Upload VR when criticism was raised about Jamie's professional judgements being for SALE and Upload VR replying those david heaney articles had his name removed because it was a ""collaborative"" effort by several authors?)

Certainly Mr. /u/palmerluckey , being a journalism major at USC, would not stand for such lies and distortions, much less pay to publish them would he?   I personally advise not to trust anything david heaney, will mason, or jamie say, as they are for sale to the highest bidder for yellow journalism at best.

Steam sale is on. Many great games on sale. Here's a few I would personally recommend

&amp;#x200B;

\-Until you fall for 14usd.  ... Until AW came out , UYF was my favorite VR sword fighting game. It is not realistic, it doesnt have realistic physics but what it does have is a super cool presentation and an awesome gameplay loop that keeps me coming back for just one more run . It's a vr sword fighting roguelike. It also had a large update recently. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Borderlands 2 vr for 33... I have personally not played BL2VR but from everything I've seen, it runs great on Oculus headset and having played the flat version for years , I know it has hundreds of hours of content. Even if it doesn't have online coop which does suck a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Skyrim and Fallout VR for 18 .. Kinda the same as borderlands. Hundreds of hours of entertainment for less than 20 bucks. Don't forget to download some mods. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Moss for 17. .... This game is a masterpiece. You need to buy it.  Stop reading, buy it now. 

\-Wildlands 2 for 8 bucks.... another great game for a great price

&amp;#x200B;

\-In death for 12. Another VR masterpiece. Bow and arrow roguelike game.

1.)  Does the Quest link feature use your PC to run games, or does it work some other way? 

2.) When the Quest is connected to a PC, does it negate the limited battery, or do you still have to charge it?

3.) From what we have, does anyone know if the Quest's future hand tracking capabilities will be a gimmick, or a useful feature?

4.) Will the Rift S get the hand tracking feature in the future?

5.) Does Oculus sell anything like the Valve Index Controllers? If not, Will they in the future?

6.) Will Boneworks and HL:A support the Rift S and/or Quest?

7.) What are the minimum requirements for VR? Is my 1060 6gb enough?

8.) I have a small room space, would the Rift S even be viable?

Ok so I streamed some Espire 1 on Friday, I had a laugh on stream, kinda enjoyed what I played at the time, but on reflection over the weekend looking back at the Old Espire 1 Video Blogs they posted about what they wished to achieve with the game, the game honestly doesn't look like it improved much over the past 2 years. Graphically this is not a looker, very basic, simple clean and sharp yes but there's not much to look at technically or aesthetically. The enemy A.I. is Fairly Dumb, at the time I called it serviceable, but serviceable in the most basic sense, they walk on very limited set patterns, sometimes they don't see you at all, and sometimes they see you perfectly from a mile away before you even know they exist.  


My Voice Commands didn't work on stream but theres speculation that it was because I was streaming and my voice wasn't registering (not sure if that's true or not) You can drag bodies and hide them which was cool, and it did help to give a metal gear solid vibe at times, but in general there didn't seem to be much of a big reward from going stealthy, and during the campaign going stealthy was limited to how many Tranq Darts you had left. Admittedly i was trying to Tranq everyone and perhaps i should have just Stealth avoided enemies instead of trying to take them all out. 

You can Pistol Whip them and you can punch them out cold, but that requires getting right up close which isn't always doable. I did enjoy that you can take objects and empty clips from your gun to throw across a room and distract the guards, and i liked the little wrist cameras you can use to throw around corners to check enemy movements, but in the 2 hours i played I barely needed to use them other than for the sake of it.

I will play more to see if it gets better or maybe I chose the wrong difficulty level (it wasn't clear what was easy or hard mode) but the game was Luke warm, a B title or AA at best, after Asgard's wrath and Stormlands, and the Promise this title had prior to it's release it currently feels like it's missing it's opportunities, and was punching above it's weight in terms of media hype and coverage compared to the title it actually turned out to be.

It's not an outright bad title by any means, and if you go in with low expectations you'd probably be happy, but I went in with high ones as I've followed it for 2 years and it just fell a little short of blowing me away, Something I am conscious of as I head in to Boneworks release in a couple of weeks time.

It's funny because I watched my stream back and I sounded like I had so much more fun and my summary at the end of the video was so much more positive than I feel now, I think a weekend of looking back and contemplating some of the old blog videos where the guy was searching the corpse's pockets for info or ammo or keys and Used a mini camera to take photos of secret documents etc alluded there to being far more depth than I've experienced so far, Admittedly theres a chance we will be able to do all this in later missions, I've not got passed the 2 hour or so mark yet, but theres been nothing to indicate we ever will.

Am I judging it to harsh to early?

He says it's a gimmick, a novelty that'll fade soon and that whatever I get will be replaced really fast in an instance with better technology so it'll be pointless to buy right now. I'll be honest, it's kinda discouraged me a little out of not wanting to disappoint him and that maybe I'm just trying to get the next best thing without being patient.

But it's kind of a budget PC. Anyway with the news of the upcoming Half-Life VR, and the fact that I own an Oculus Quest and soon have a USB cable for link, I was wondering how ready my PC actually is for this kind of VR and what upgrades I should focus on if needed.

\&gt; Specs: Ryzen 5 1600, RX 580 4GB, 8GB RAM

First, yes, the system RAM is too low and I'm gonna order another 8GB stick so it'll be 16GB RAM. But my question is more if the VRAM on the gpu is as important? I got the 4GB version and the minimum requirements what they're saying for HL:Alyx is the RX 580 with 8GB. How important is that difference? If huge, what would be a good gpu upgrade?

My CPU is probably completely fine, I think. Still going on strong. Other than that probably get a new SSD with some space available, my current one basically has Windows and it's full. Don't think I should be running VR games on a regular HDD but who knows.

Now yea I know this is basically the minimum requirements for HL:Alyx. But I don't mind playing it on lower settings as long as it's playable. I have limited budget for now. Another question I'm wondering is how these specs are doing on already released high-end VR games right now?

I have an Oculus Rift S with the controllers. I also have muscular issues that make moving the thumbstick (left or right hand) painful if done for more than a few minutes. Wondering if anyone knows of good VR games that don't require thumbsticks as primary controls.

For example: Brass Tactics is my wonderful go to as you use the grip mechanic to move around the board and point to move troops. Using the stick occasionally for attack move or defend is ok, I just can't be holding it down to move for primary locomotion like most games. Beat Saber is also great for this.

Finding it hard to discern how games control before purchasing, as an aside I think all VR games should have a brief free demo you can download to give you a few mins or a test level to see if you like the flow, controls, graphics, comfort level etc.

Now that is black friday I thinking about upgrading my Lenovo Explorer into a Rift S. The problem is... it's really worth it? 

I got my Lenovo for 150€ last year and so far I'm pretty happy with it but each day I'm getting more tired of it's odd things. Example: the sweetspot goes from meh to bad, the moment you stop looking ahead and look more into the edges it goes very blurry. Image quality is okaish at best too (I think WMR software have somethig to do with it) and WMR tracking although is good most of the time, sometimes it goes mad and do weird things. Oh! and I really hate those touchpad. It seems honey moon ended for us.

So, I know Rift S tracking is far better and I know it doesn't have touchpads in the controllers but, how is the image quality?  It's really much better than the Lenovo? and how is the sweetspot? In some places I have read that Rift S Fov is worse than Lenovo Explorer, is it really noticeable?

The final question, is worth the ""upgrade"" for 400€ coming from a 150€ Lenovo explorer?

I'm average at BeatSaber, I haven't beaten an expert+ before but I'm pretty frickin' close! Anyways, I'm getting on a ramble here... My idea for making beatsaber more challenging both physically and gameplay-wise, is to buy ankle weights. This works because you put them around your wrists. I recommend you start with 2 pounds and then work your way up to 5 pounds. It will help you play more intensely so that first off, by increasing your swing speed so that you can react faster without the weights because you'll be used to the weights on your wrists, and also, it is more challenging physically so you'll get more physical challenge out of it! Right now I'm on 2 pounds, but I'm going to work my way up to five pounds, trust me, it doesn't sound like a lot, but when you put them on your wrists and start swinging, it makes it more challenging, I'm not saying it will be hard for everyone because everyone's different, but for me personally it's a very fun challenge!

Edit: I have uninstalled and reinstalled oculus software (including going into explorer and uninstalling everything oculus related) and the issue still persists.

Edit 2: Reinstall of windows didn’t fix it.

Today, I plugged in my Rift S again after about a month of being too busy to play it, and in the meanwhile I have updated my graphics card drivers, Oculus software, and windows. Upon plugging it in, it asked for a firmware update and I let it run its course but it stopped halfway through and told me to keep it plugged in, as if I had unplugged it, and now I am back to DisplayPort Not Connecting. I have tried:

reseating cables on both ends

updating windows to the most recent update

opting into beta for oculus software

unplugging and replugging

It's an amazing spell weaving fighting game that pits you against another player to see who is the best mage (balancing issues aside, cause a meta did develop). There is incredible depth of choice with amazing characters with unique abilities.  

However, the downside is that it depends on the player base. It's almost entirely a PvP game (the pve is a joke) so when there are no players there is no game. Months ago the wait times became longer, which in turn caused more people to leave and so on. I logged on just now and there was no one for me to match with. 

However, this really is one of the best games in VR. I implore the developers to do 2 things. Firstly, bring it to the Oculus Quest. The userbase is growing and it would be perfect for a mobile system like that. The game doesn't require much movement so any space really works. 

The second thing, which is much harder, is to make the game free to play. With the game state as it is I can't imagine they are generating much revenue from it. If they made the game free to play however, they could introduce an entirely new playerbase that would breath new life into the game. They could (and should) implement a cosmetics system which will allow them to generate revenue from micro-transactions (and obviously only cosmetics, nothing that would make it P2W).

Many games have this setup, League of Legends, Fortnite, Apex Legends, Swtor, and have been doing well. No game in VR has this setup and The Unspoken would be a perfect game to take advantage of this opportunity to save their amazing game.",oculus,The Unspoken is probably the best game that should be revived,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/e1o09z/the_unspoken_is_probably_the_best_game_that/,True,submission

I’m about to invest in a gaming laptop pretty much exclusively for playing VR and I was wondering if anyone would shed some light on what the practical difference between the recommended specs for the newer games is vs what you get from the minimum specs? Here’s a few bullet points worth mentioning:

1. Due to space restrictions my gaming rig has to be a laptop. I know this kills it from a future proofing POV, but I don’t have another option. 
2. Due to budget restrictions, the best I can afford is a i78750, 8GB RAM, GTX 1060 3GB.
3. My only headset is a Quest which I intend to use with either VD, ALVR or Link.
4. I’ve never played PC games, I’m super tech illiterate and tweaking settings to optimise performance will be tricky for me.

According to my research I should be fine to play most of the games I want to play, but I noticed that the newer raft of games coming out need gtx1080 or higher. So my question is, will games like Saints and Sinners, Stormlands etc. still be playable, albeit with a few concessions on performance/graphics, or will this new batch of games effectively draw a line in the sand for the shelf life if this laptop?

It was tested with Oculus Rift-S and HTC Vive, however the vive has some troubles with it atm (will post a update-fix asap). It should work just fine on the Oculus Rift-S with the Oculus Touch controls and I would be interested if it works on Oculus CV1 as well.

So, the key points:

- I have a good computer, 3.4GHZ i5-7500 and 16GB RAM (I think), should be able to handle VR to a reasonable degree. I'd like to try Tiltbrush, Beatsaber, HL:A, off the top of my head, as far as I know they should be within my specs?

- With that in mind, I'm almost sold on the Rift S over the Quest. I'm unlikely to need to bring VR outside of the house and since I already have a decent computer I might as well make use of it. The LED vs OLED thing, I'm not sure I'm enough of a connoisseur to notice the difference all that much, so I'd rather a sharper display.

- My main concerns are regarding IPD - I'm at 65mm and I'm given to understand that's like half a mm below the max? I've seen different results when I Google it so I'm not sure. Also I'm wondering if the Rift S is likely to be completely outshone in terms of support/new features since I've heard that dev efforts are more likely focused on the newer headset.

- My only experience with VR up to this point has been a session with a PSVR set; I was quite impressed by that so you can probably imagine that my bar is quite low in terms of what to expect.

- The Index is obviously well out of my price range atm.

So, TL;DR, I'm pretty sure I want to go Rift S, but is there anything major I should be considering or that I might have missed that would majorly screw me over?

I have my CV1 for about 2 years. I love it but it's not super sharp and SDE is not that great.

I would like to have a better higher res headset that is sharper.  

Rift S would be a good choice but it doesn't seem it's the future.

Quest seems to be ""the"" headset but mobile only wasn't my cup of tea but now, with the Link, it's a whole new game.

I can't try them where I live so I need to take a guest (like I did with CV1) but from what I read :

Rift S pros : comfort, sharper, tracking.

Cons : LCD, clearly not the future for Oculus.

&amp;#x200B;

Quest pros : OLED, mobile and PC

Cons : not comfortable (or buy a Vive DAS $$$), I suppose the link image quality is good but not as sharp as Rift S ?

&amp;#x200B;

So, some questions about the Quest:

How is the SDE ? 

Does the link PQ of Link is a good step above CV1 ? Because it needs to really worth it to spend all that money.

Is the confort really that bad ?

GTX 1050Ti 4G

i7-8750H w/ 6 cores

8GB DDR4 (With 8 more soon)

I'm super pumped to play, but in my research I am struggling to ascertain which set I should purchase. Price is definitely one of my major concerns, and as such the Oculus sounded like a solid choice overall with the games and requirements. However, I have no clue if the Rift S or the Quest w/ Link would suit me better. I'm looking to play all manner of games, so if the Quest cannot handle some that would pose an issue. If anyone can point me in a good direction, that would be greatly appreciated.

I initially ordered the Rift S, and it is arriving tomorrow. However, I hear some YouTubers say that they think the Quest Link looks better than the Rift S due to the OLED. Do you think this is legit, or are they just trying to justify their purchase?

I don't care about portability. My use case will be using the headset for hours on end with playtesting, maybe building worlds in VR, etc. I am used to a 144Hz IPS display with a 3ms response rate, and I picked the Rift S because it has a higher refresh rate and because I figured it must have a lower response rate. I am thinking maybe going back and forth between the two may give me a headache, and it must be even worse with the Quest (despite the small difference). But, considering all the reviews, it really seems the Quest is getting more praise, and I hear it will get 90Hz eventually? Does this apply to the S as well?

I hear the Rift S is superior when it comes to SDE, but I can't tell if this is compared to the Quest natively or with the Link. The most important thing for me is comfort, and getting as little eye strain as possible. Do you think the OLED display will do this for me?

What about tracking? I know the Rift S had some issues with it in FPS games, but it got patched. Considering the Quest has fewer cameras, is this an issue as well currently, or has it been patched on the Quest as well? Accurate tracking is really important to me.

I am on the edge of ordering a Quest and returning the S, simply because of the OLED display. What's your opinion on the matter?",oculus,Rift S vs Quest Link for a developer,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/e0x4x3/rift_s_vs_quest_link_for_a_developer/,True,submission

Lately, I have been noticing some oddly poor performance when playing VR. Even simple games such as beat saber, which normally isn't a problem for my 980ti, all of a sudden has issues keeping up framewise. It's not a constant low FPS, but highly variable from perfectly acceptable to sudden spikes.

This led me to investigate a little bit so I opened up task manager. Which reported only about 40% GPU usage and all other stats were below 100% as well. Since I don't usually play normal games I wouldn't know how they perform but I booted up 3dmark fire strike which ran right on par with other 980ti:s. The last things I did was uninstall the game, in this case, beat saber, uninstall the Oculus software and update my GPU drivers. None of these helped. Now I am stuck without knowing how to proceed other than completly reinstalling my computer, which I'd rather not do.

For the past few weeks I've been set on getting a Rift S, but I recently read a few articles about the new Quest Link, effectively turning the Quest into a linked headset.

I only intend to use my headset for tethered games, and have little to no interest in mobile VR, so for me it really comes down to specs, unless mobile VR is truly worth it and I just haven't realized that.

For Black Friday, the Rift S will be 350$, while the Quest won't be discounted, so it will stay at 400$, plus the additional 80$ (?) Link cable.

It really seems like a mixed bag, as to which is better. The Rift S has higher refresh rate, something I know is *very* important when it comes to immersion. But the Quest has a slightly higher resolution, plus an OLED display, which is a big plus as I love Elite: Dangerous, which needs true blacks.

The Rift S also lacks hardware IPD adjustment, which, yikes. I know my IPD is in-range (I'm pretty sure), but I def want other people to be able to try it with no problem. (Honestly how did Oculus leave that out?)

Basically, my question is, is the Quest really that much better **spec-wise**. Like 50$-130$ (including Link cable)? Please take into account that I have absolutely no intention to use the Quest un-Linked, so that isn't a plus for me.

Are there any other specs that are unlisted?

I just upgraded my system from an i5 6600K to R5 3600 and of course the mainboard from an ASUS Z170K to an ASRock B450 Pro 4. I did not reinstall Windows (lazy me) and now my Rift S is not working correctly anymore.

I can use it for about 2-5 minutes and then it shuts down with static sound and a black screen and comes up again. It seems to be offline during that since SteamVR pops up with a warning that the headset cannot be found.

All the USB power tricks are done (power management and device manager settings to prevent Windows from shutting down USB devices).

Any other advice for me? Should I try the beta Oculus App?

Its not like my rig should be gasping for air running most games with a CV1 either as my GPU is a GTX 1070 OC'd a bit and a Ryzen 5 1600 OC's a bit as well. Not to mention that the Oculus software itself is installed on my M.2 SSD, and all games are install on either my M.2, or my SATA SSD. Lately though I've been getting nothing but freezing, stutter, and dropped frames on majority, if not all my games. Even in Oculus Home I'm getting theses issues.

Just recently after one of the updates I could even use my Rift because it was a just a black screen, and no signal. Until I realized that I had to reinstall the latest update, mind you, this was the same update I already had installed, and then it all of a sudden started working. I even uninstalled and reinstalled the Oculus app, as well as uninstalled Oculus Tray Tool as I feel it might have been casuing some of my performance issues, but alas performance is still the same. Afterwards, I haven't been having a satisfactory experience. I'm not sure what else to do here. 

My best guess here is that my issues are a mixture of W10 and the Oculus drivers not working well together. I really don't want to spend hours reinstalling Windows, and getting everything setup to my liking again just for everything to go back to its previous state in a few more months.

To play with Oculus Link I need USB 3.1 gen 2 so I bought 2 PCIe Extension cards (2 in case 1 doesnt work).  
Problem is now they both do NOT get recognised as USB controllers - so I don't get any usb connection, even though they DO provide power to whatever is connected, like a phone or the oculus quest.

I tried updating to newest bios, and updating drivers - no difference.

I tried installing ASMedia USB 3.1 Controller drivers from the internet - no difference.

In device manager under universal serial bus controllers it does say ""AMD USB 3.10 eXtensible Host Controller - 1.10 (Microsoft)"". Those drivers seem up-to-date.

I tried going into BIOS and changing PCIe Slots from 1x16 to 2x8 in case the graphics card (gtx1080) draws the slots or something - no difference.

So I really don't know what to do next.. Maybe someone here has an idea what the problem could be?

I bought a Rift S 3-4 days ago (Although debating returning it with the revelation of Oculus link and just getting a quest). For the most part it has been fine. But sometimes the display will abruptly shut off. When I take the headset off my monitors have died too and there seems to be no way to wake the machine. I know things are still running because I can hear noises (including whatever VR game I was playing) continuing and reacting to movements and inputs. However the monitors remain off, as if they aren't detecting any input signal and the Rift will not display an image again. I have to reboot my computer to remedy this. At first I thought it was a sign of overheating and although I intend to do a speedfan test I am not certain anymore as it seems to be completely random the times it does it. It has done it consistently across various apps. Sometimes it is an hour in. Sometimes 40 minutes. Sometimes 4+ hours.

This is very easy to verify for yourself if you've ever used AL-VR at the highest resolutions, or even with native Quest apps when using supersampling.

I think the reason behind this is probably latency. The video probably takes quite a bit longer to decode when using higher resolutions than what Link uses.

My name is Ben, I am a fellow VR enthusiast (Own 2 PC VR headsets, have 2 rooms dedicated souly to VR in my house). I am actually here to ask for help, help on a project that I think can bring some more people to VR. This of course requires some backstory for you all to understand fully. (TLDR at the end)

I am in the process of creating a fairly lengthy series that follows me and one of my long time friends (and fellow VR enthusiast) on adventures spanning multiple VR games. This is not like ""let's plays"" it's actually a giant connected story, following us two. Every single game that gets played is connected in a much larger ""multiverse"" and every game is connected lore wise in some way shape form or fashion. 

Basically, I am trying to become the Frankie of PCVR. Frankieonpcin1080p was a man that brought hundreds if not thousands of people to Dayz strictly from his story telling, and the way he made the worlds feel so cinematic. I am trying to do the same exact thing here, and I 100% plan on it. The series I am writing out is action based, with some solid humor and a very interesting storyline behind it.

 I have the pilot episode written out in complete detail (Episodes will range from 20-25mins), and it spans 2 games. But, I am actually in need for some actors. These actors of course need to be able to use VR, and I need them for more than likely only one play session (this time) as prior to releasing the pilot I want to release a trailer. The trailer will show snip bits from a bunch of different ""world"" (games) that we travel on in the season, and different interactions with PEOPLE in them. 

This is where you lovely folk come in, I need some people who are willing to join me in my efforts to get this ball rolling and create a cinematic universe for VR. I need some actors to play specific parts in specific games for the trailer, and later on down the road when I actually start production on said episodes. I of course do not want to release a lot of the plot as that will ruin the fun and suprise factor. 

The games that will be played are not limited to much of anything, but I will say the ""base"" game that our characters live on is Echo Arena VR, and the very first ""world"" they go to is climbey (For many reasons) 
Let me know what you all think, and if you want to be apart of this journey let me know. 

TLDR: I need actors to do some VR action / story telling scenes for a series I am doing, and if you want a long term roll it's possible (this is strictly for a trailer right now).

Late Fall 2020: Oculus releases the beta to their wireless solution for Quest. This isn’t done to sell more PC VR games, but is merely done for a case study/research purposes to see how people use it. 

Late Fall 2022/Spring 2023: Oculus releases their long awaited “V2” of VR, the Quest 2. It is their only headset offering. It features but is not limited to: foveated rendering with AI to guess periphery, much higher FOV, the ability to look at objects close up with no blur, no perceivable screen door effect, higher refresh rate, the equivalent mobile processor that is 1-1.5 years old. 

It will take a note out of emerging console playbooks, and sell for $499. (Due to the huge success of the Quest and the more advanced hardware of this headset)

All games will be “PC enhanced” compatible for the hardcore gamers, which can use their PC to give their games a boost, wirelessly. This will be accessible via a dongle that Oculus sells.

Additionally, Oculus will sell what is essentially a “mini PC” for $399 for those who want to enhance their games wirelessly but don’t have a PC. It won’t connect to a monitor and will only have a power/reset button. 

I do not think Oculus wants to release the “PC dongle” I mentioned two paragraphs ago, but will only do so just to not anger the PC master race. (Similar to how the Rift S was only released to appease the PC crowd - we know their main focus is Quest)

Subsequently, if the Quest 3 isn’t completely self contained in 2028/2029, Oculus will not release the dongle and will have moved past PC customers completely.",oculus,"Hey guys I’m a VR and Oculus fanatic, and I think I’ve figured out their hardware strategy going forward.

I've heard that some people at this range have a perfectly fine experience, but it seems to vary greatly from person to person and there isn't a store offering demos nearby. 

I'm now looking at buying the Quest, mostly due to its adjustable IPD and Link. I would mainly want to use it through Link, but if the cordless experience is good enough I'd likely split the time 50/50. I've seen some opinions and videos on Link, and the only consistent complaint is that the screen is slightly blurry in comparison to what you would see on the S (Keeping in mind the software is in Beta and the official cable is still to be released). 

My question is: Which device would be better for me? I've only tried the PSVR and so don't have any other PCVR devices to compare the S or the Quest to.

So I've been considering getting VR for a while now, and with Black Friday creeping up, I'm definitely considering it a bit more now.

I'm in the market for either the Rift S or the Quest. 

I love the idea of the Quest having wireless capability for its own games, as well as being able to hook up to my PC, and function essentially as a PCVR headset... but I have an AMD graphics card (a pretty decent one too, so I'm not looking to replace it anytime soon), and I've heard they aren't supported.

On the other hand, Rift S does look like it's supported, and while it is wired, I think I can probably look past that to enjoy the system itself.

I am interested in start the process of selling my old CV1 gear.  Specifically, I have two full sets of hardware (and some extras) totaling 2 full CV1 headsets (with headset cables), 3 pairs of controllers, six sensors, sensor stands, etc.  The only problem with any of the hardware is that both CV1 have succumbed to the audio issue, which I typically get around by just streaming audio to other speakers. 

The challenge is that I'm not sure how exactly I should try to price these to sell them.  My first thought was maybe $100-$120 for each complete set, so $200-$240 for the complete collection?  I feel this is really low-balling their value, but I expect lacking built in audio is definitely a detriment here.

Sometimes my rift (CV1) display goes black after about an hour of play. Audio cuts out, mic doesn't work, Oculus Home and SteamVR can't find my headset. If I wait with my headset on after the screen goes black, the screen will repeatedly flash white for an indeterminate amount of time before going black again. The display won't come back on, but the audio and microphone will, and tracking will resume in game but the screen will either keep flashing or go back to black. Removing the headset will turn off the display until I unplug my headset and plug it back in. The headset's face sensor bit will also show an orange light.

When it does this, the only fix seems to be to restart my computer, as upon unplugging and plugging my headset back in, the problem will reoccur after 5-10 minutes of play.

So, I'm working on custom grip poses in Steam VR for Oculus Touch controllers in Unity, but despite setting ""Range of Motion"" in Steam VR\_Behavior\_Skeleton to ""Without Controller"" my hand pose is still mapping the thumb to the physical joystick location / face buttons making it impossible to form a proper fist.  


In the documentaton, Steam describes these range of motion modes as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;EVRSkeletalMotionRange  
Drivers for controllers that support skeletal input are required to provide two streams of animation data: the pose of the user's hand as accurately as it can track it, and the pose of the user's hand as if they were not holding the controller.  
&gt;  
&gt;VRSkeletalMotionRange\_WithController - The range of motion of the skeleton takes into account any physical limits imposed by the controller itself. This will tend to be the most accurate pose compared to the user's actual hand pose, but might not allow a closed fist for example  
VRSkeletalMotionRange\_WithoutController - Retarget the range of motion provided by the input device to make the hand appear to move as if it was not holding a controller. eg: map ""hand grasping controller"" to ""closed fist""  


*Source:*  [*https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/wiki/SteamVR-Skeletal-Input*](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/wiki/SteamVR-Skeletal-Input) 

However, despite the index-pinky fingers appearing to close into a fist (as opposed to the slanted ""holding controller"" pose, the thumb is behaving as described in the ""WithController"" option.

I was going to buy Bionik-Mantis but a lot of reviews mentioned it got poor speakers. 

There is MarkMurphy mod for KSC75 https://imgur.com/gallery/V7zKoN9 but that doesn't look too stable unless you have a 3d printed adapter. 

And there is a guy who made custom Sennheiser https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAnqoQxUrjQ&amp;feature=emb_title but its too expensive. 

So a few hours ago I was trying to find 3d printed adapter to mount KSC75 speaker to my Rift S but then somehow I looked at my current Chinese F15 a headphone (20 Hz - 20,000 Hz with 32 Ohm)

or  https://www.amazon.co.uk/Headset-Cancelling-Microphone-Control-Notebook-Blue/dp/B01KLMC3Y2/ref=olp_product_details?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=


And the idea came to my mind, it looks like this headphone is a godsend for Rift S users. you don't need to solder or do any complicated thing to mount this headphone to your HMD, you only have to remove the speakers and bend the metal to mount it perfectly. the metal clip is Stanley steel so use pliers or any other tool to bend it just like in the pictures, The clip will set very tightly on your Rift S so it's really good as you will able to adjust it and make it touch your eyes lightly and comfy. I didn't want to play with soldering so, for now, I just left the cable as it is and attached it to the HMD cable with tape.

In case you thought about modding your Rift S with these headphones then do it on your own risk, it's very simple but if you make the metal too tight and you forced it to your HMD and break it then  I can't take any responsibility for it. just be gentle when you mount it on your HMD. 

For only $17 you can have the experience you never thought you will, makes you wonder why Oculus went cheap for only $17. all the hate this HMD got was from CV1 users since the sound is a downgrade comparing to CV1. this HMD is so underrated. Right now the only comparison I can make is with CV1 and this modded headphone sound better. I'm going to get Sennheiser Game-One soon and I will compare it with that expensive headphone and leave my review here later in case you are interested.

This brings me on to the rift S, my only concern is that lacks the ""upgradability"" the Vive has but has an easier setup process and is less cumbersome. 

I'm mainly concerned about the user experience when actually using the headset, for example if the Vive provides a better visual experience i'd be happy to deal with the setup process.

So, here we go. This review will be from about 2 hours in, because I just needed to do this now.

I am playing the game on an Oculus Rift S and first of all the game looks and runs great. I did not notice any noticeable slowdown, even in large open areas with several enemies.
Now with that out of the way, the gameplay. This style of gameplay has so much potential, but there is just something wrong with it. First off, the AI. The AI in this game is pretty outrageous. Sometimes they will be right across the room looking in your direction and they won’t see you. Other times they will see you behind walls. Sometimes the voice commands just go off for no reason, but I am guessing that turning the voice sensitivity down will solve that. My point is the AI is inconsistent and is not fun to deal with.
This is also an issue because it makes stealth, a main point of the game, to be very difficult. You can crouch behind boxes all you want, they will find you. 9 times out of 10 I just found myself going in quiet and being forced to go out loud because these AI have superhuman powers.
Another gripe I have is grabbing items from your belt or chest. Good luck trying to pick up the repair item while holding the gun. The magazine just happens to be in the exact same place as the repair item, making me pick up the mag 80% of the time. Now that I think of it, good luck trying to pick it up at all if you aren’t looking at it. I never found myself picking it up out of instinct. I always had to look down to grab it.
Something so annoying that I had to deal with for the entire time was one bug. Others have talked about it, even I have tried to find a solution to no avail. For some ungodly reason, remember after being delayed twice, controller models are layered over my arms, blocking my sight while aiming and being a general distraction. I have played over multiple sessions, I have tried uninstalling the game, and restarting the mission doesn’t help either. This is for one of the comfort settings which I TURNED OFF! Did they not test this!? If a setting is turned off it should be off! I do not want to look at that godforsaken controller any longer.

Interestingly, I remember when the Quest was released, [some people remarked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8-j1dUs58o) that the ability for it to be a standalone would probably be better as a ""hybrid"", allowing you to play both PC games and other ones (including many ports) with its (2017 flagship level) Snapdragon 835 SoC. It seems to me that getting more bang for your buck and more options is probably the best way to go for most users, though of course enthusiasts will probably not think this way and care more about raw specs.

But it really seems to me that Oculus is going for mass appeal with this option, and if you want a bleeding edge product you can go with a Vive Pro S or perhaps a Valve Index, since those still use the technically superior but far more cumbersome and inconvenient exterior tracking stations. To an enthusiast the increased precision will make this a non-brained, but more casual users will be put off by having to clear space and install tracking stations just to get a not so significant increase in accuracy - which is also being circumvented through algorithms. So following that business strategy, a headset dedicated for hardcore PC gamers might not make much sense when you can have a headset doing both in a ""good enough way""

With that said however, even the supposed advantages of the Rift S seem to be... eroding, as it were, and perhaps the Rift S might become an overall inferior product with the possibility of the Quest compensating for the Rift S' remaining advantages.

* The Rift S' main advantage was its bigger and better PC catalogue, which is now something that both devices share. Although, [this article claims](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/oculus-link-transforms-quest-better-riff-s/) that not all Rift games will be compatible, without disclosing how many or why. Plus Vive and WMR stuff, I guess? **And you can also run** the Android stuff on the Quest. Kinda makes the Oculus Go/GearVR possibly redundant as well?
* Ditto for Passthrough+, which is also now available on the Quest.
* The main advantage the Rift S still has is its higher refresh rate, at 80Hz instead of the 72Hz found on the Quest.... however, as far as I can tell the LCD on the Rift S is being overclocked at 72Hz. Oculus claims the Rift S sported an 80Hz refresh rate to keep the system requirements in line with those of the original Rift, which ran at 90Hz. What I want to know is, **is it possible to allow (possibly optional) overclocking on the Quest at 80 or even 90Hz** as part of a future software update, if your computer is able to run that?
* It does have a fifth tracking camera. However, it is on the topside of the headset, and is supposedly there to ensure compatibility with previous Rift titles. How necessary is it really, and **how much accuracy does the Quest really lose** without it compared to the Rift S, particularly when it seems that its accuracy is being greatly improved with AI/algorithms compensating for it?
* The DisplayPort solution is superior to USB-C since it is a dedicated solution and will not necessitate video compression. Most people will not notice the difference however since video compression is used everywhere and most people again have no idea it is happening. **Is it possible though, that when Oculus releases its own dedicated optical fibre,** that it is able to greatly reduce or even eliminate the need for that compression? Or is this a hard limitation of the USB-C standard?[Apparently VirtualLink already did this.](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/virtualink-connect-vr-headsets-to-pc-single-usb-c-cable/)

There are also of course some innate advantages to the Quest that people found strange that were not present on the Rift S, which made the Rift S feel like a small incremental update of the original Rift, one of the reasons why the Rift S felt like it was not worth it, particularly if you already owned the original Rift:

* The screens on the Quest has higher resolution (1440x1600 versus 1280x1440)
* OLED technology instead of LCD, overall a superior technology
* Manual IPD hardware adjustment, something which not only stopped 30% of human beings from being able to play on the Rift S' limited software adjustment, it also greatly improves comfort for every user that wasn't lucky enough to be born with specific dimensions on his skull.
* The Snapdragon 835 is a flagship grade mobile SoC. Granted, it is not as powerful as the top desktop (or laptop) hardware, and *it is* a 2017 model, but it is reasonably powerful... I remember reading that is roughly as powerful as an average 6-7th gen i3 or i5. Can it be used for specific purpose when playing PCVR games, possibly improving performance for the user? That article I've linked before does say that:

From comments made by staff, it seems that the USB-C cable isn’t just a  pass-through display cable, so the hardware on the headset will be still  doing some work.  

* [Another article says that](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/oculus-quest-finger-tracking-coming-in-2020/):

&amp;#8203;

     Later in the event, Facebook  explained that the technology used model-based tracking and neural  networks to see exactly what your fingers are doing and instantaneously  recreate them in VR. This is all done using a mobile processor, without  compromising the GPU or CPU performance.

* [Hand and finger tracking through the cameras.](https://www.digitaltrends.com/vr-headset-reviews/oculus-quest-hand-tracking-hands-on-review/) This provides a new opportunity for games and apps without any additional software. The fact that this is not (currently) coming to the Rift S also seems to indicate that Oculus is kinda abandoning it. Though the controllers will likely remain more accurate, I am under the impression that, similar to the comparison between the more accurate tracking stations an the more convenient embedded cameras, more casual users would rather get just the Quest with no controllers... particularly because, the controllers are quite expensive themselves. On Oculus' site, a replacement controller costs 70 dollars... each. The Quest costs 400 dollars with controllers. I imagine Oculus might start selling the Oculus Quest alone **at 300 dollars as full price**, possibly even less, and treat the controllers as an add-on, for users that **are** interested in paying more for more accuracy. This is assuming the controllers **do remain** more accurate, and perhaps future development will approximate that difference, and motion gestures and virtual menus might replace the use of physical buttons for the sake, again, of economic and business sense.
* Some of the cross-platform abilities like streaming to Chromecast

With all of this said, and the obvious boom VR as a whole is going to get, it really seems to me that the Rift S is getting shelved in favour of the Quest not only because it makes more sense for a mass market, but unless you go really overboard with enthusiast features (8K rendering, 240Hz etc), the Rift S might not even be worth it for that market anymore. Zucc, in fact, seems to talk about PCVR-only headsets as a niche market that VR has grown out of.

The game that I played is really not the game in the trailer. The trailer looks like a super cool stealth game while the actual game really isn't that good. Shots dont register, graphics does not look the same, weird AI. There is so much more that they could improve to make the game better. I think that they would keep the game closed until they make it better and actually look the same. In the trailer, when the character throws the mag and the guard goes to see what it was, will never be able to happen in the actual game. The detection radius is way too large and it detects through walls? (Only happen to me?) It would be better if they just kept it closed and released the improved version in January or February insted. Just take your time and make the game better. The game right now is okay but it is really not worth the 28 euro that you have to pay for it. Its more if a 5 euro game right now. Im just in the second mission and i have already got bored. I know that they worked hard on it but they need ti improve the graphics (maybe its just my pc thats bad and can't candle the graphics but I dont think so since i have the graphics set on the highest), detection, the gun handling and the hit reg. I would actually be really satisfied with the game if they did that. Otherwise I really enjoy the game. The movement, climbing, is pretty good. As I said before the hit reg is pretty bad but I think its pretty easy to fix. (I have no idea tho it might be hard). The scenery looks completely different in game and in the trailer. The trailer should of course look better but this is too much. The scenery and the hands looks like they are from two seperate games. The scenery looks like it is from a 5 euro game and the hands look like they are from call of duty. I think that they should make the game better looking so it actually looks like it is from the same game. (Maybe im going too far idk.) It would really be worth the 28 euro or even more than that if they fixed it. The game could be good but it needs improvement. 

To summarize I think they can improve the graphics, gun handling, hit reg, detection area and AI movements (more natrual. Right now it is more like a robot). They also did a lot of things that were grate for example the movement, the interface, the voice acting and more.

###  [https://uploadvr.com/half-life-alyx-mod-support/](https://uploadvr.com/half-life-alyx-mod-support/) 

### [ Source And Modding

Source was the Valve-developed engine used to create Half-Life 2 and its episodes, as well as games like the Left 4 Dead series and Portal series. Source 2 is its successor, first used for the Dota 2 Reborn overhaul update.

Source has always had a focus on support for modding, with a huge modding ecosystem in the years after Half-Life 2 released. Several popular Steam games actually began as Half-Life 2 mods, including Chivalry: Medieval Warfare, Dear Esther, Insurgency, and The Stanley Parable.

Garry’s Mod (GMod), a sandbox physics sim game which began as a Half-Life 2 mod, even heavily supports community content in itself. It has over 1.5 million items on Steam Workshop, and is the tool used for many hobbyist YouTube CGI shorts.

### The Potential

Depending on exactly how much access the new Hammer and associated tools give to users, Half-Life: Alyx could be a platform for custom VR experiences that can be created much more easily than using a game engine like Unity and Unreal.

The wording “all of the game’s virtual reality gameplay tools and components” could mean that creators will be able to adopt Half-Life’s interaction mechanics and physics without coding them themselves.

This could be revolutionary for the kind of VR content a person or small team can deliver. When developers don’t have to re-invent the wheel, they can focus on story, artwork, and gameplay.

If the tooling allows for it, this could even lead to new spin off games of the sort we saw from Half-Life 2. Half-Life: Alyx could have implications for the VR games landscape far beyond the game itself.\]

&amp;#x200B;

This article is to me THE MOST EXCITING PART! I would put my chips down on a bet that this game, but even more so, SOURCE is going to open up VR Dev to so many more. I think this leads to creating worlds and game while in VR, and perhaps, like GMod and TiltBrush, Multiplayer creation would allow for gameworlds to expand quickly...

I'm getting extremely close to buying my own Rift S, and just checking through the last few things before I go ahead and make the purchase. I've heard that the built in headphones as well as the microphone are fairly low quality so I planned to use my standard HyperX Revolver headset that I've had for a couple years, and after reading a few posts and comments on this subreddit it seems like a perfect fit. I was wondering though, Can I use the microphone on my headset as well? The headset has a male 3.5mm Aux cable, which plugs into a small box that can mute the mic and adjust volume. The mute/volume box then has a cable that goes for a metre or so before splitting into two male 3.5mm aux cables, which can either be plugged directly into a PC or into a USB adapter. I know that the Rift S headset only has one 3.5 aux jack that only works for audio (or so I've heard), so is there anything I can do to make it work? the only idea I have is plugging the headset directly into my PC with a usb male-female extender, which in itself is fairly inconvenient.",oculus,Can I use a headset Microphone with the Rift S?,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dzye28/can_i_use_a_headset_microphone_with_the_rift_s/,True,submission

Pros: 
- Lightsaber Dojo offers a variety in challenge and has replay value. 

- Force powers are intuitive and easy to use, and they feel great. 

- Lightsabers look, sound, and feel awesome to use. Deflecting blaster bolts is an awesome feeling (especially in episode 3 story, where blaster bolts are shot at a faster pace).

- The art design and atmosphere is great. It looks and feels like Star Wars, no doubt. 

- Story telling was generally fine and done well, tho the story itself could’ve been better. 

Cons:
- Simplicity in gameplay. Nothing in the story mode felt challenging. It consists of just walking forward from point A to B, pulling door levers, and using a force grab or your lightsaber to overcome an obstacle. Why isn’t there more to do? Puzzles to solve? What about more blaster weapons and grenades to use?

- Product development and release. Honestly, this game should’ve been developed as a single title and NOT piecemeal. The piecemeal plan has created inconsistencies in the play experience so that you only want to launch the most recent episode title because there is more for the game to offer in the most recent installment. I have zero reason to play episode 1 or 2 again when ep 3 gives me the most gameplay variety. It’s almost like the devs were working on a shoestring budget throughout the whole dev cycle and needed the piecemeal approach to fully fund and finish the game. 

- Movement. This is probably the biggest downside to gameplay for me. It completely hurts the immersion and gameplay experience when I’m locked to a single position to just flail my arms in the air. Gameplay is thus less dynamic and interesting than it otherwise could be. This is especially apparent in the final duel with Vader. No one has a lightsaber duel just standing in place. I understand this is the general gameplay design they went with, but it’s TOO simple and is honestly just lazy. 

- The stupid droid. She’s annoying. That is all.

Others say that the controllers aren't that innovative and a bit clunky for doing hand gestures (which I care a lot about as I plan to learn more sign language to speak with new friends I made), while someone exactly 20 minutes ago told me that the Rift S has the second best hands and fingers tracking compared to the Valve Index, which made me skeptical to hear.  
Many have said that I wouldn't be able to load a lot of games, avatars properly on VRChat, or even join certain worlds, while I have been reading constantly that the Link could be a life-saver in that regard, making one able to connect it to one's own PC almost seamlessly.

As I would like to know more from proper users, whether unbiased or passionate about their own VR Headsets, I have been wondering whether I should get a Valve Index, an Oculus Quest, a Rift S, or another type of headset, for example Windows Mixed Reality ones, where I haven't been able to find anything related to finger tracking at all.  
Could you let me know your thoughts and impressions of your current setup, whether I should focus on the Index or Give the Quest/Rift S a try, and what would exactly happen to the Rift S while Oculus Quest seems pushed forward and preferred?

Let me preface by saying I'm a huge fan of stealth game all the way back to Thief 2 , the original MGS and Hitman 2 . I love stealth game and this is probably the first ""true"" stealth game I've played in VR. I guess stormlands has some stealth but (lol) . 

I played about 45 minutes of Espire 1 but part of that is also replaying the first half of the first mission cause I kinda screwed up and got found, wasted all my bullets... I just decided to restart. 

Anyways Espire 1 is HEAVILY inspired by MGS. The premise of the game is literally ""A mysterious terrorist organization has infiltrated our secret base and you are the only one who can infiltrate (through a robot) to find out who these people are and stop them"" .  The game is also surprisingly story heavy at least in the beginning. There's a briefing right before you start the game and after that I had constant chatter from NPCs. 

You get I think 3 people talking to you over the course of the first 1-2 objectives. Not sure if this changes. Early on you get introduced to your silenced pistol and climbing. The climbing really is one of the best things about this game. Anything that looks metal-ish youll be able to climb . 

&amp;#x200B;

The levels so far are pretty open and with some creative thinking there's really more  than one way to approach your objective. During my first playthrough of the first mission I kinda got discovered early on and had to shoot everyone and they just kinda kept respawning lol. After that I restarted and I went panther like behind enemy lines, I got neaaar caught multiple times and it was all very exciting . 

The other thing I noticed a lot was the music. It really has some solid tunes. It gives me a MGS x Deus ex vibe. Here's hoping the sound track is not super short. 

The graphics are very bland but at least you can super sample the crap out of it to make it look sharp . Performance was spot on . Even though everything was kinda fugly it is nice that every object in the environment you could grab and throw . After playing AW/Stormland where everything is just kinda stuck this is a nice change.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall really enjoying the game, hopefully it holds up for 4-6 hours more!.

Here is a mad theory: they were developing the HL2VR as a mod to HL2. That has its disadvantages, I think especially on the support of movement mechanics. Then Valve gets in touch with them and offers them to do HL2VR as a mod of HLA using the same modding tools that will soon be available to everyone with HLA.

That gives many new opportunities, but sets back the HL2VR countdown. A lot of work goes into migrating to Source 2. But not unseen before (see HL:Source).

It was mentioned that players are advised to finish HL2,  Ep 2 before going into HLA. Could it mean that HL2VR arrives shortly before March 2020 HLA?

1. Reinstalled Windows 10 three times (as in, deleted the whole partition, recreated the whole partition, and reinstalled Windows) and attempted to install Oculus each time. Fail.
2. On the third install, I specifically ensured I had the standard NVIDIA drivers installed and not the DCH drivers (this shouldn't matter though).
3. Turned off antivirus and firewall (Windows Defender) which did absolutely nothing to help the installer.
4. Tried to install to another drive - well...the installer literally won't launch if I try to run it with commands through the command line like is shown [here](https://support.oculus.com/1142129705828091/).
5. Deleted all temp folders and old Oculus folders after failed installs.
6. Tried everything that people have said on Reddit or other places on the internet for fixing Oculus failed installs.
7. Restarted my computer. Many. Times.

Here's some weird behavior:

1. No logs are created in %localappdata%\\Oculus, and the folder isn't even being created.
2. Installer gets to about 2/3 to 3/4 complete (I see that a lot of the Oculus software is installed at this point, including the Oculus Service in Windows Services), and then rolls everything back saying it failed and that I need to restart my computer.

We are adding movement based ability system to Cradle of Sins MOBA game. Meaning abilities are activated by doing a specific movement with your hand. For example the defensive wall from the ground is brought up by pulling your hand up while holding the activation trigger down. Or shooting a tornado/fireball with a punching motion. This requires aim.   


What are your thoughts on it? I it gives the game a good balance between movement based fighting (immersive) and the ""regular"" shooting.

1. There is simply no room for my headphones. Going from comments on the internet, I would need to use earbuds or risk breaking my 300€ headphones stretching them over the entire thing.

2. No adjustable lenses. I have an IPD of 72 and internet discussions I have read about this went as follows: Oh, I can use the headset just fine. Ok, I may need to squint a bit and one eye is always blurry so I have to turn the HMD a bit to the side, but otherwise it's fine!

Judging by this, no screen is really superior, they have different strengths: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nilhor5NT0g

Now, I'm not very interested in VR gimmick games that the Quest specialises in. I want to tinker around with stereoscopy and motion controls in regular games, use Dolphin VR and watch movies, among other things.

So my questions are:

1. Can I do the same things with Oculus Link as I can with Rift S? That means, will application recognize it the same or are there limitations to the streaming?

2. What about the comfort? Heard the Rift S just feels better to wear.

3. Are there any issues running this plugged in? If I have to run this on battery, it's a no buy.

4. Is there lag compared to the Rift S?

TLDR; this game throws a lot of content at you but doesn’t feel overwhelming. Combat is fluid and easy to pick up, traveling is freeing and the best I’ve played in vr, and the game offers variety to keep me wanting to come back for more. While there are negative aspects of the game, minor tweaks could easily make this a 9/10 or 10/10 recommendation. 

The biggest complaint I’ve seen so far has been the combat staleness and weapon differences. While I understand the position they are coming from, I think it misses the point to say they miss depth. You have options to be a stealthy sniper or an in-your-face gunner with drones. How you build your character kind of defines the weapons you use and I think that offers great versatility. All I want from combat is to make it easier to use the Firehawk Rifle scope cause I spend more time finding the reticle for a single enemy than I do gliding around the world and it doesn’t even do that much damage at lvl. 5.

Speaking of gliding though, travel is so fun and really is the center of the game. If you choose to upgrade your slipstream, fling, vortex, and gliding thrusters, you will never want to touch the islands because you will be having so much fun flying through the maps that you’ll almost forget about the main point of the game. Climbing is great, and this is also another valid complaint, but grabbing on to walls from a full body length away is almost too free and sucks when I’m trying to hang on a wall and instead of grabbing my gun with my other hand, I grab the wall through my body. That aside, traveling through the Stormlands is a blast, and again is easy and simple to catch on to once you get the hang of it and makes for a fun experience if you don’t want to get too sucked into the combat

The reason I think simplicity is the this games coolest feature is because it gives you a lot to take in but doesn’t feel overwhelming. The combat is engaging, allowing you to take different perspectives based on your build or how tactical you feel like being, and gives you enough to walk away from each encounter with a feeling of accomplishment without wasting your time. Resource gathering is easy enough to never feel annoying and rewarding enough to keep you searching for more materials.

After playing titles like blade and sorcery or some of the newer releases like asgards wrath or stormlands it's a bit hard to play these games because it feels a bit too simplistic. It's probably better to think of the Vader Immortal games as experiences with light interaction. It's more about telling a story and getting the user to experience what it'd be like inside the world. The production quality is top notch and the graphics look really good. Voice acting is also very good.

 I'm not sure why there had to be 3 separate episodes. I feel like delaying release and having one app with an uninterrupted story would have been better but I'm assuming it was a combination of wanting to release with the Quest and to accommodate for the quest's battery limitations. It's not a huge deal but I don't think each episode is worth $10 but it's probably easier to sell three $10  episodes than a single $30 game that has only about 2 hours of story. 

I'm an older Star Wars fan that like most older people prefers the original trilogy and didn't love the prequels. After playing Jedi: Fallen order which has a darker more serious story I found the tone of this story a bit strange. You're dealing with a serious matter but everyone is joking constantly. For some reason much of the non movie media these days has to introduce magical objects or other plot devices that always come off a bit goofy.

I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy the three vader immortals because I did, but the experiences were a bit inconsistent. I do think that for younger people or people who aren't spoiled by more hardcore VR games or darker stories these games will be a lot of fun.

I was planning to buy a inside out tracking VR headset since the Rift S announced.
I haven’t get it due to the lack of physical IPD adjustment which the VIVE cosmos have.
I have bad experiences of the software IPD adjustment on PSVR so that I really want the physical one.

However, after a long time of waiting, the cosmos tracking problem stop me to buy the VR headset again.

I know that the RIFT S has tracking problem when it released but fixed by update patch. The cosmos may solve the problem in the future.(But who knows?)

I also find that quest video was compressed with oculus link.

Any advice for me too buy the VR headset consider that only the PC gaming experience.

After some preliminary testing, Oculus Link is working on my PC connected to the motherboard USB (ASUS TUF B450M-Plus Gaming), but not on the USB 3 connector on the front of my case.  My graphics card is an RX580, so even though AMD cards are not listed as compatible on the Oculus website, they seem to be functional on a case-by-case basis.  Another interesting thing that I discovered was that I could use my AmazonBasics USB 3.0 extender cable that I originally purchased for my Rift to essentially double the length of my playing cord, making the playable space even greater than the Rift or the length of Oculus' own future Link cable.

As for the experience, the graphic quality is not 100% as clear as that on the Rift, but definitely still allows for a playable experience and will run Oculus and SteamVR games.  Controller tracking doesn't feel sluggish and I can expect it to feel like my Rift.  

The only issue that I've had so far is noticeable frame drops in some games.  Beat Saber was completely fine, but Echo VR would stutter at times which may make sickness-prone players nauseous.  Of course, since the graphics card isn't officially supported and Link as a whole is still in beta, issues like these are to be expected.

I will update tomorrow when I get the chance to run Oculus Link on a PC with an RTX 2080ti and see how the experience compares.

TL;DR: Oculus Quest functions very similar to a Rift S when connected via Oculus Link, although there are frame drops in some games.

I've tried both with Quest Link and Rift S, but during the setup process, I've found that the moment I plug in the headset, the app confirms it detected the headset, then... the app shuts down, reboots, and repeats. I can't do anything in it at all when I have a headset plugged in, and despite I've been googling hours into this, I can barely find any acknowledgement of the problem aside from a few Oculus forum posts that don't actually get answered or resolved.

For specs, my computer is fine for being VR ready. They are...
 - Ryzen 2700x CPU
 - 16GB DDR4 RAM
 - Both NVidia 1050ti and AMD RX 580. This is because I built for virtualization, but I'm doing this from Windows 10 only, right now.

My USB 3.0 and 3.1 slots work fine, directly in the motherboard. I'm only using cables from the Rift S itself now. At one point, the app said it broken and needed to repair its installation. 3 hours of downloading 7GB later, it finished and... nothing has changed. It's still as broken as the first installation.

I cannot set up my Rift S because I don't know of any good third party stuff that bypasses Oculus nonsense. I returned by Quest since I intend to just use PC, as mobile gaming seems impractical for me. I do development stuff, and play things once in a while, but that's mostly it. I intend to take this and my PC to some families' house for Thanksgiving so they can see VR for themselves, so I'd like to have this issue fixed ASAP so I can confirm everything is working.",oculus,Oculus App constantly restarts.

Was curious to try out the Link Beta so I picked up the cable that Oculus recommended on their site while I wait for the official Link Cable to release. After Amazon delivered it I quickly went to set things up. I plugged the cable into a compatible USB 3.0 port and then connected it to my quest. My PC immediately recognised it and everything was green! It said the cable was good and ready to go...I just had to put the headset (Quest) on and enable the Oculus Link Beta from within. I put the headset on and clicked OK and then!.......nothing. It just went immediately back to the Quests home environment. No errors, nothing. I made sure I had the right drivers installed for both the Quest and my PC, tried various USB 3.0 ports etc. etc....still nothing. I noticed that Oculus had tweeted out saying that the Link wasn't working currently on the public test drivers and to turn off PTC in the desktop software. I did that and it had to go through some update/driver update. I then reconnected the Quest and tried accepting the Oculus Link Beta again from within. This time it went to a black screen with the three white loading dots. I assumed my problems had been fixed as before it didn't do anything. I waited and waited...and waited. It would not get past the loading screen. I'm currently at a loss. The setup says everything is fine...the cable and USB port are good to go. Everything is showing up green on the desktop. It recognises my quest and everything. My PC more than meets the requirements (1080ti, i7-6700K, 16GB RAM).

Since the Quest is also OLED, I wanted to test out if link can keep those qualities. Unfortunately when it comes to blacks, it has the same issue I have with LCD screens I've tried. Everyone always talks about the shade of black in lcd headsets and calls them grey or whatever but that's not my issue, my issue, that nobody ever seems to mention, is that it is harder to see details within darkness. 

The best way I can explain it is, you know how some pancake games make you adjust your brightness so that you barely see something([example](https://i.postimg.cc/GtjRqLzQ/x720.jpg))? The Rift CV1 would be the barely visible box but to me, the quest with link(or lcd screens) is like the not visible box.

Here's an example video from Asgard's Wrath: https://streamable.com/2vf0g

This staircase leading to a cave is dark but on the Rift, I can still see certain details on my companion, like feathers, light colored spots, etc.. While on the Quest using Link, she basically just looks like a black silhouette. Same with ground or wall textures. When I look at the wall to the right with the [Rift](https://i.postimg.cc/N0nW49tY/riftwall.jpg), I can pretty clearly see wooden boards on the wall whereas in the [Quest](https://i.postimg.cc/NF6SBdHf/questwall.jpg), it's very hard to notice. That wall also for some reason has some noticeable ghosting on both headsets although it's way worse on the Quest.

I've tried dark areas in other games like Subnautica or The Solus Project and saw the same results. I also noticed some weird distortion or something in The Solus Project when using the flashlight that doesn't happen on the Rift.

In Stormland I slightly notice black bars if you move your head side to side too quickly. 

So that's just my warning to other oled snobs like myself.😛 Don't get rid of your CV1's just yet.

We'll see how much better it gets with updates and the official cord.

By the way, this is going to be a long one.  


// Testing PC //  
CPU: Intel Core i7-6700K  
MB: ASUS Z170-Deluxe  
RAM: 32GB DDR4-3200  
Graphics: EVGA GTX 1080 FTW3 Hybrid  
Oculus App Version 1.43.0.324220 (1.43.0.324220)  


// Connection &amp; Settings //  
After I have updated both my desktop Oculus App and the firmware on the Quest, I just plug the headset to my PC and the desktop Oculus App will change to a setup guide like the Rift/Rift S. In the Quest, you will have to first allow the PC to access the device’s storage, and then the “Enable Oculus Link Beta?” will follow.   


Here is where I first encounter a problem, as the Quest will not complete loading, the three dots are blinking forever, and unplugging the cable does not fix the issue and finally I have to restart my Quest, and then the connection works and Oculus Home loads up.   


Now, this is where the second problem happens, the audio is coming from my USB speakers even though I have the audio output set to “Oculus Quest headphones” in the desktop Oculus App. Moreover, the Windows sound mixer doesn’t show the Quest being an output option thus cannot switch through there. In the end, I just unplugged my USB speakers and the audio immediately changed to outputting through the Quest. (Seems like the Quest is not recognized as a priority audio output if there’s another USB audio device connected).  


// Cabling &amp; Ports //  
I bought two cables intend to test how they go with the Quest + Link, I was testing mainly using an **ANKER PowerLine+ USB-C to USB-A 3.0 cable (6ft/1.8m)**, I also bought a **MAGIC-PRO ProMini Type-C to Type-C with USB 3.2 Gen2x2 spec (3ft/1m)** because I don’t own a USB-C to C cable with USB 3.0 so I want to test it as well. 

Since the main cable for testing is still quite short for any kind of immersive playing, I also tried a set up using it with a **Cable Matters SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Type-A Extension cable (6ft/1.8m)** to see whether it would work. I find it also has a preference in what type of USB ports would work, here are the details and findings:  


**A)** ANKER USB C-A cable → USB 3.0 (3.1 Gen 1) port – **DOES NOT WORK.** Windows will straight up say the device has stopped working.  


**B)** ANKER USB C-A cable → USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A port – **WORKS.** With this combination, Oculus Link works immediately and does not have any impact on picture quality.  


**C)** MAGIC-PRO USB C-C cable → USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type C port – **WORKS.** But the cable is far too short to play anything, and I don’t seem to find any good C-C cables with USB 3.1 longer than that.  


**D)** ANKER USB C-A cable + Cable Matters extension cable → USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A port – **WORKS.** Seems like a good combo that allows immersive playing and no observable reduction in picture quality and no increase in compression, same quality as setup A. The only downside of this is the cable does carry some weight and I can certainly feel its presence on the left side, a clip around the back of the headset might solve this but I guess this is what the official Link cable is aiming to solve.  


// Picture Quality &amp; Compression //  
A short way to describe the picture quality of Quest + Link: a CV1 with higher resolution and a wider field of view, less clarity than the Rift S, also a decrease in sense of presence.  
In Oculus Home, it feels almost the same as the Rift S but the edges of the Oculus Dash interface feel much softer. Here is where you can most easily experience compression: when I move around my head, I can see the edges of the Oculus Dash panels at my peripheral vision starts to wiggle and pixelate, but nothing that would break the whole experience.  


When I load in Asgard’s Wrath and Lone Echo, this is where the OLED panel shines. The deep blacks are really adding back the moody feel of the dark mead hall and the space station compartments, it does make these two games more atmospheric compared with the Rift S, as I find the LCD panels giving a higher brightness to these games and when I look at a light source there would be too much blooming like my pupils didn’t contract. However, in terms of color, I find it to be just overall a bit more saturated than the Rift S, but it is not significantly better or vibrant than the Rift S.  
Moving on to picture clarity, this is where I feel the Quest’s PenTile OLED panel is showing its limitations and I would prefer the clarify of Rift S’s RGB stripe panel, the screen door is back. In Asgard’s Wrath and Lone Echo, character faces already look smudgy when I’m about 3-4 persons away from them. The “!” in the objective markers lose all definition when I’m 3\~4 meters away. The most observable clarity difference is that when I put up my hands in Asgard’s Wrath, in the Rift S, the skin details and wrinkles are clear like I would see mine in real life, while on the Quest the details feel like being smoothed-up.  


Still, thanks to the higher resolution of the Quest panels, texts are generally easier to read than in the CV1.  
To the point of the Quest + Link ‘s decreased sense of presence, the feeling is that on the quest both games everything seems to have less depth and gives a flatter feel, not as up close and personal, like watching a 360 video rather than in the game world. I think this is the combined effect of the PenTile OLED’s lesser clarity and the lower refresh rate at 72Hz. In this aspect, the 80Hz of the Rift S really is making a difference here, and I would say even with the older CV1, the 90Hz display is giving a better sense of presence and immersion than on the Quest + Link setup. But then again, would it break immersion with just 72Hz? No.  


// Tracking //  
Surprisingly this is where I found I don’t need to put too many words in. Testing this aspect with Beat Saber, the Quest maintains the same tracking capability when connected to the PC. It is still easier to lost track of the controllers when reaching far out and far back than the Rift S, the Link did not improve nor degrade the quality of tracking.  


// Comfort //  
Without extensively modding the Quest, the weight of the headset + the pull of the cable is making a longer session of usage very uncomfortable (30 minutes in and the Quest is already pressing hard on my face). In this aspect, the Rift S handles long session usage much better in my opinion.  


// My Conclusion thus far //  
Oculus Link is a neat gateway for those who already own a quest and want to have a taste of what PCVR can be, but it cannot replace the Rift S as a full-fledged PCVR headset as it is a compressed experience over one cable that is not made for transmitting such signal in mind, and to make it comfortable also means extra cost needed.

So stormland... Very divisive game but I'll add a Tldr right now : I frakkin love this game. It's so much fun just to mess around, fly around the map, this game gives me the same feeling as something like prototype where just destroying stuff and traversing was fun.

Now to a more in depth discussion, what is stormland really? 

Is it a destiny or a division clone? Is it like borderland? 
Is it a Rogue like?... Is it far cry? 

It's really none of these things but maybe a little bit of everything. Stormland starts with basically a prologue campaign, you get a few cutscenes to introduce the characters, a few flashbacks and exposition and then you are sent off to your first level. 

This first 4 levels you play are really not like the whole game will play like. They are more structured and more like a ""regular"" campaign. It is kinda easing you into the way things work. As you progress you will unlock new skills that allow you to access new places in the map. These levels are pretty large and I've seen people compare it to wind waker, where you are basically travelling across an ocean with multiple small islands. 

Once you get to an island it does kinda play like far cry. You'll see enemies, turrets, tall  grass to hide. You mostly will shoot at robots but stealth is in theory an option. You have an all seeing eye that makes combat really easy since you can see enemies through walls. In single player I died quite a bit but definitely the game is more manageable in coop. 

You'll find weapons with levels from 1 to 5. The game reaaally is not a destiny like. You don't really grind weapons that much, more on that later. Along the way you'll also be scanning everything ala Metroid prime. This is important since every thing you scan gives you ""growth"" 

You will also find special seeds called aeon buds that allow you to upgrade your character. 

Basically your character has different slots in each body part : head, legs, arms, chest. Each slot costs growth to unlock. Each upgrade cost either growth or growth + aeon buds. 

Some upgrades are pretty boring like extra rifle ammo others are pretty game changing like an upgrade that let's you double jump or use your boosters in the air.


You also have a work bench where you can buy weapons, items , special arms etc. Weapons that you buy in the bench will also upgrade the weapons you find in the field with better ammo. You can also upgrade your robot arm with a special weapon (one at a time). Through scanning you can unlock new items to make in the work bench as well. 

Once you finish those first 4 levels.. You get a really nice cutscene and basically the cycling world begins.Your room at the camp will now show a screen with a counter of when the next cycle is coming. 

Once this happens you will lose all your upgrades. This means all your weapons will cycle again to level 1. Your bench will reset your weapon level. You will lose all your aeon bud skills as well. What you do keep is your growth #. Also next time around there are more skills to unlock, so your maximum potential does go up. 

You'll have 7 days again to defeat all 4 levels, gather all the weapons again and upgrade your character. What is actually different each time around?. Well I'm not quite sure but I believe that there's basically 4 themes of levels that basically have different map. 

So on week one you might get cloud forest 1 and desert 2, and in week 2 you might get forest 6 and desert 3. Each level is said to have unique flaura and hidden logs left by the humans to try to figure out wtf happened in the stormland. 

Each week if you beat the final level your escalation level will go up and the difficulty with it. Still not clear how different it's going to be or not but it's an interesting enough concept. 

The way I would see this is like this : this is a very fun shooter with very light rpg elements and some random variation that instead of being player triggered, it's triggered by the devs once a week. 

The most fun part of this game for me is the traversal imho. With an upgraded character you just feel frakkin powerful imho. You can soar through the skies, dive bomb in the middle of 4 enemies, blast them with your shotgun and then burst jump away before they can retaliate. You can become invisible and go on a stealth killing spree. You can basically cross through 70% of the map with a single well executed jump, boost and glide. 

It is just soooo much fun.  With that said, you probably won't be playing stormland as much as asgard's wrath. The incentive to keep playing stormland is to basically do multiple runs, scan all the logs, animals and flora.. And get the secret ending which is said to happen after you best the game on escalation 2.

It is a repetitive game by nature but I can see myself playing it at least 15 to 20 hours, thanks to the coop and the incentive to kinda obtain a truly maxed out character and see the true ending. 

I know people that have been playing Arizona sunshine for years in coop.. Well I'd rather play this game lol. 

My biggest gripe with the game is that it is quite buggy. Myself I encountered a game breaking bug that I was only able to fix in coop. Patches are rolling out so hopefully it will get sorted soon. 

The other thing is that the whole cycling world is a bit gimmicky. The game basically demands you to stop playing and come back next week lol. You almost always will have some objectives to complete to get additional money or aeon buds but you won't get an increase in difficulty or a brand new level until the cycling world deadline passes. It is an odd choice to say the least.",oculus,"Just ""finished"" Stormland",https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dyy9pt/just_finished_stormland/,True,submission

On the other hand the Quest has better support and can do more different things than the Rift S with a higher resolution oled screen.

I have gotten the go ahead from my wife to buy a set of VR headsets for my son and I for Christmas. After extensive research, I have settled on the Oculus group due to the variety of games and lack of need for lighthouses in the room (my wife doesn't want VR towers messing up the house). I have a high IPD (72) but my son is in the sweet spot for almost any headset. I also have a VR ready PC, so using the Link is an option. 

I was thinking about getting a Quest and a Rift-S. I thought this would give him the ability to go tethered or not, and allow us to play together. I also thought a Rift-S may give him a better experience with some games and Steam VR. 

My question: would we be able to play games together? Or would it make more sense to get two Quests? 

Thanks!

We are making a shooter for VR with hero elements. And currently working on single/co-op horde mode, basically shooting lots of enemies, not dummy ones that are just approaching towards you but the ones who can cover, hide and fight. The game has about 10 playable heroes and in horde mode you shoot against those heroes. 

Now the problem is.... since you are going to fight with a lot of enemies, it could be overwhelming if the AI has all the powers the heroes have.  We need to make a design decision here regarding the AI in horde mode. Which is to make the AI only fight with melee weapons or with all the powers but less effective.

The question is of course, what do you prefer in VR shooter in general: melee AI or shooting AI? And in our case, what would work for you?

Thanks in advance.

I was wondering if it was possible to get a DP extension that is 10 meters long, as I have my PC in a different room than the Oculus Rift S will be in. My current idea is to get a 10m DP cable and use a female to female end on it to plug the Rift S into, however I'm not sure if it would work.

I have found a decent USB 3 10m extension with many good reviews on it, so that shouldn't be an issue.

If a 10m DP isn't possible, then could I use some sort of HDMI to DP adapter?

Alternatively, should I not bother with the Rift S and go with a Rift? I'd prefer to have the Rift S because of it's inside out tracking, however if I got a Rift instead I know I can get long enough cables that work for HDMI.

I've been using VR since 2015 now so I thought it might be a slightly more interesting experience that would be neat, but not game changing. A friend of mine bought one and I got to try it last night and I was very wrong. 

First of all, getting into using VR with Quest is as pain-free as I could ever hope for, with the possible exception of not needing controllers, and that's coming. My buddy pulled it out of his backpack and I was in VR two seconds later. Friggin' amazing. 

I knew that there was a pass-through mode for setting the Guardian boundaries but I couldn't have imagined how awesome it would look or feel to be in that mode. It made me feel like I was in a VR version of my house, which I kinda was I guess. But it was so neat to walk around with the headset on and be able to see so clearly in 3D even. I don't really know how to explain what I was feeling because what I've said sounds kinda dumb, but it was one of the most thrilling experiences I'd had in VR in a long time. 

I was only more impressed when I had to paint my Guardian boundaries. Being able to see the room around me and paint directly on the floor around furniture was exactly what this should be. Painless and thoroughly enjoyable. Even when Rift was brand new, creating a Guardian boundary sucked. With Quest when I felt like I could maybe get a bit more room into my play space it was no problem at all. On Rift, I would probably just never have bothered.

I tried a few demos and they looked amazing on the crisp screens. What I could see was so clear that the smaller FOV didn't bother me at all. In fact, initially I thought it might be bigger than Rift because I felt so much more present in the VR world. Then I tried Tea For God. 

Holy shit. Unbelievable. Prior to Tea For God I'd have fleeting glimpses of this thing we call presence. Moments where if I sat perfectly still and didn't think about it too much I could almost feel like I was actually somewhere else. But Tea For God, despite it's low poly graphics, is the most sustained presence I ever felt. I'd heard people talking about the movement in TFG and I had wanted to try it, but this was my first time and I'm glad I got to try it on Quest first because it is so much better than on my vanilla Rift (I still haven't tried Rift S.) The increased resolution, lack of a wire and the way Quest handles sound was all I needed to forget the headset altogether. I actually felt like I was there. I became afraid of heights, I felt claustrophobic in the tight spaces and relieved when I stepped into a more open area. It wasn't long before I was able to forget that I was just walking around the same small area in my house. 

Before I tried this I was starting to fade on VR. It was neat, but I never felt like I was actually in the game. When I came to trust that if the game made an area available to get to it meant I could actually go to it without bumping into something irl it was like the final barrier broke down. I didn't have to think about my house anymore, so I didn't. It was magical. I really hope that more games are made with that movement system and/or we figure out some other way to do it because using my actual legs to move around seems to be a very important piece of presence.",oculus,"TL;DR - Quest is not only an amazing VR experience it is the best I've had and finally feels like the VR I've been waiting for since I was 12 (I'm 38 now).

The first cable I tried was this one:

[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07Q8V9YXB/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o02\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07Q8V9YXB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1)

It seemed to work at first, because I got the green tick in the Oculus software and the prompt on the quest to enable it, but it disconnected a few seconds after enabling it, causing the prompt to show again. This cycle would repeat so it wasn't usable. There's a chance my cable is defective, but I suspect it's just too long.

Next I tried the Amazon Basics 3m cable:

[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07D7S9211/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o00\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07D7S9211/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

This worked first try! Although at first when I was viewing home it stuttered a lot. Basically unusable. However as soon as I booted Asgard's Wrath it became buttery smooth.

The video quality is very good, but I can tell it's not quite as good as the CV1. I think that's because of the video encoding.

The headset does indicate it is charging when this cable is attached, but I don't think it's a very powerful charge but it did go up a few percent in 15 minutes.

I also have this Anker cable on the way:

[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07G148YMS/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o01\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07G148YMS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

However I got the dreaded ""this delivery has been delayed' notification from Amazon, so I don't know when I will see it.

So far everything works fine except audio. Audio still plays through my PC output, and not the headset. This is a bit weird because the first 5m cable I tried did have the output playing through the headset, albeit briefly before it disconnected.",oculus,Quest link cable report,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dz6425/quest_link_cable_report/,True,submission

I am a former PSVR owner who was very underwhelmed by the experience.  In short, I guess it never ""clicked"" with me -- I never got a sense of depth or immersion, nor did I ever have any sort of ""wow"" factor the first time I tried it.  It mostly just kind of felt like I was playing a game but just much close to the screen.  

I have a couple ideas as to why I had a bad experience -- first I am glasses wearer (and I have an astigmatism), and the headset always felt awkward/uncomfortable with the glasses.  Additionally, I constantly kept having to adjust the headset alternating between having it high and low on the back of my head, to find the right ""sweet spot"" where things were in focus.  The headset always felt like it was too far away from my face (lots of light leaking in), and virtually all text outside of the center of my vision was unreadable as things were constantly out of focus.


Lastly, I never felt that the IPD setting was right, and would constantly try to tweak it, but it was a software change that was slow and tedious, and I really just wanted some more immediate way to try some different IPDs.

So, I'd like to give another headset a shot, along with some prescription lenses to mitigate the comfort/glasses factor.  I have a decent gaming PC (with a GTX 1080), and thus I am leaning towards going for a Quest due to the link functionality.  Additionally, the Quest has a physical IPD slider, which is something I'd really like to have given the above.  

So my question -- has anyone been in a similar situation, and would anyone commend the Rift S over the Quest for me?  Additionally, does the Quest have a similar effect of things being generally blurry/out of focus in the periphery of your vision like PSVR and, if so, is it to the same extent?  Finally, can anyone compare the tracking of Quest to PSVR headset and move controllers?  I found both to be very much lacking, and would often get a ""juddering"" or vibrating effect, making games like Superhot virtually unplayable.

1. Ensure you have the same game purchased on both Oculus store and Steam.
2. Index user run Steam VR first and wait in home
3. Second user with Quest gets set up with HMD on
4. Index user from within steam VR go to desktop and start up oculus home
5.  Quest user plugs in the link cable and confirms link HMD prompt within headset
6. Index user runs Onward on Oculus library 
7. Immediately run Onward on steam 
8. Profit

These steps ensure that you can smoothly set up the quest user from within your index HMD rather than trying to tell them what to do or to go back and forth yourself. It also ensures that your monitor is displaying the index/steam instance of Onward rather than the oculus one as this seems to kill performance if the other way around.

Gameplay was super smooth with a 2080ti and we were able to create a private game no issue.

I’m now going to be trying more games with this set up as the main criteria seems to be that they can be dual purchased on both steam and oculus.

Contractors should work in the same way along with Arizona Sunshine.

Again this started happening after the last update and I've done all the standard troubleshooting steps :

\- Manual reinstall ( remove drivers and folders in safe mode etc.) 

\- Change USB ports , re-seat the cables

\- Reinstall windows on a new hard drive and then install oculus drivers

&amp;#x200B;

However none of this has helped and after about 5 mins of usage the headset crashes and the home app restarts. I can't get it RMA'ed since I moved to a country different from where the headset was purchased , however I'm highly doubtful it's a hardware issue as it was working fine until the installed the new drivers.

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen that many people have this issue, basicaly my headset is stuborn and for past two weeks it's giving out a ""restart required"" error. Im in active contact with the support and for now it seems like they have given up, they want to replace my headset with a new one. But Im still motivated to get that thing going, to dry literaly everything possible, so lets see if anyone in here has any ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

Current state - The headset shows as connected and ready, it requires a restart all the time in a loop. Seems like a known error in the community, I saw other posts. I managed few times to use the headset untill the next pc restart, we are talking here about playing vrchat for like 3 hours straight, to the point where I exited the game by myself. So its hella strange for me since it seems like the headset works perfectly fine under random circumstances... I am using an Inatec usb 3.0 extension card, to eliminate the power supply suspicions

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried literaly every fix I have found for past weeks on forums, redits and the ones recomended by oculus. The list goes: Clean instal of oculus home, turn on the camera in privacy settings, turn off power management on every usb port, tried working with my antivirus and windows firewall, tried every usb 3.0 and display port in my pc, tried unplugging everything from my pc exept the headset and the mouse + monitor, adjusted the cable inside the headset, tried a user account named ""1"" to run oculus, tried launching oculus with only one monitor, all my drivers are up to date, Im using a microsoft driver for the Inatec card, Im sitting on a fresh instal of the Windows 10, I have been adjusting the power plan settings in few places

&amp;#x200B;

And there might be few others that I didnt mention. I basicaly tried every fix possible to be found, I wonder if any of you have an idea for the most random fix that I could apply before sending this headset back to oculus. I basicaly could write a big megathread with all the possible fixes to all oculus problems, I have tried all of them.

System:  
MSI 72VR 6RE Dominator Pro (over 2 yrs old).  
Nvidia GTX 1070   
This has 6 USB 3.0 and the first port I tried worked without a hitch.

  
I tried about number of different games last night,  switching between Rift S and Quest. The Oculus software is great in that accepts plug and plug with a quick swap of cables. I started three,  now ancient space shooters: Gunjack, Ansher Wars 2 &amp; Endspace.  The Quest performed exactly like the Rift S - and looked equally good, on top of having that nice OLDE black. You almost couldn't tell the difference between either headset, though the Rift S screen definitely looked cleaner when in between stages..indoors,  looking at details like map screens.  

Moving on to something more recent and taxing like Asgard's Wrath; the Quest overall held its own, but there was notably random lag, here and there, but not enough to diminish game play at all. In God Mode where the world around you becomes miniaturized (more details on screen), the environment had random faint skipping, like at times, it was trying to catch up when I changed my view. Still, overall, quite acceptable considering how the Quest is being fed. The colors were deeper on the Quest which I liked, but definitely no where as sharp as the Rift. Details on NPC's skin (like the pub) were retained from a distant on Rift S, but on Quest, you had to be real close up in their faces to see the equivalent, and still, it had a softer look, like the screen had a subtle coating.

Where things were very noticeable was in the more chaotic, Robo-Recall. Now, it's obvious the Quest has its own version, lovingly free of tether-land, but I figured,  the native PC RR was a good stress test. On the Quest, it just couldn't keep up at all. It staggered and skipped every few seconds.  It was still playable, but given a choice, I would stick to the toned down mobile version. Playing this on Rift S was a far superior experience. 

When dropping in and out of Oculus Home, you can see that the Rift S was sharper here. From the avatar, to all the white on black text. The Quest held up nicely, but again, the visuals seemed softend, like a camera that was just a tad out of focus. I had to struggle trying to move the horizontal options bar, and noticed, when I looked to my right, the bar's edge had an odd, ripple effect. 

Now, all of the above is my experience, others may vary. For all we know, the official cable may make a difference? I'm using the one recommended off the Oculus store (Anker, but only the available  6' version). 

The nice thing about the Quest, is having the choice. Pull out the cable and back to complete freedom. If your preference is longer playing, heavy duty games like Stormland, Lone Echo or Asgard's Wrath, and prefer sitting in a swivel chair to do so, then you'll be using the cable on Quest. Now you're playing like you have a Rift S, but with a varying levels of quality, depending on the game. For standing experiences like Beat Saber, Dance Central or Pistol Whip, the Quest just has that unbeatable freedom, and having the link is just a huge bonus to a whole world of VR greatness. As for S, it's my weapon of choice for the beefier, longer playing games.  If had to give one up over the other, it would have to be the Quest w/link, because I just love the full Rift S guaranteed full experience and resolution better.

After checking out the available options I decided to give the Kiwi Design Knuckle straps a go. I decided to go with these first because I liked the minimalist design and the fact they they appeared to still give me access to the battery compartment without having to take them apart. They arrived today and I decided to take them for a spin.

**SETUP**

Setup was pretty straightforward; an instruction book is provided but I was able to remove the existing straps and get the Kiwis on without issue. The Kiwi uses a two strap system: one strap has a look which you can fasten around the button area or wrap around the ring; the other strap replaces the stock strap. You need to loop the first strap so the Kiwi logo faces outwards. The second strap is inserted into the notch in the battery compartment; the fit for this second strap felt a bit snug but I was able to get both in without issue and the magnetic cover still completely fits over the Touch controller. Each strap has a Velcro like material on one side which you use to connect them around the outside of your hand.

**FIT**

The straps are made of a rubber-like material and feel quite comfortable against the skin. Attaching the two straps so that they are snug but still let your hand assume a natural position for using the sticks and buttons took a little trial and error but once I got them in the right position they felt nice and snug.

**PERFORMANCE**

I decided to throw the Kiwis into the deep end of the pool and fired up Ninja Legends. It takes a while to trust the straps to stay on as you swing your arms about but they held true and remained comfortable throughout. If I wanted to, I could easily jerry rig a solution where I still wrapped the stock straps around my writs and passed them thru the Kiwis but I really don't feel like I need to do that. As a nice bonus, I can indeed easily access the battery covers without taking the straps apart so changing batteries is still a breeze.

**FINAL VERDICT**

I'm sold. After putting up with the loose stock straps for months, the Kiwis really improve the experience. The also look really good on the controllers and seem like a natural part of their design. If I could make one change it would probably be to make the part that connects into the bottom of the controller a bit less snug against the battery cover but that's a very minor issue. Overall, I am really happy with them; the current set is on my Quest controllers but I'll definitely be getting a second set for my Rift S controllers.",oculus,Some Impressions of the Kiwi Designs Knuckle Straps,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dza7oa/some_impressions_of_the_kiwi_designs_knuckle/,True,submission

It's not so bad for games where you dont move too much, but with something Like Elite Dangerous where your in a firefight and your UI is rippling and ghosting, its distracting to say the least.

My left one accepts everything fine and runs as it should. But whenever I put it into the right one it still shows as offline and does not work. Yes they both work with normal batteries. Yes the batteries are charged. Yes I tried multiple brands and types of batteries.

It is rather slow, though, much slower than when I got it and it was actually a nice gaming laptop. 

I don't know how much I'd notice 72 hz vs. 80 hz. I mainly want VR for Beat Saber, so there being a noticeable difference in hard levels on that game would definitely matter. I don't really understand why the Rift S seems to have better graphics just because it's connected to a computer when the Quest has a better resolution, but that's what absolutely everyone seems to say.. 

I dislike the notion of a cord. I imagine it will bug me, and I've read some people complaining about tripping over it in certain games. 

Carmack said there will be some amount latency with the Oculus Link, so there would be no reason to get the Quest over the Rift S for Beat Saber, unless the cord is enough of an issue or my computer isn't good enough. 

I don't care about battery life really; if I'm playing long enough to kill the Quest, I should take a break. Haven't looked into the sizes of games much, but the Quest only having 64/128GB over all the storage on my laptop is somewhat worrying.

What's happening is that when I try to use the Oculus link, within the Oculus software it prompts me to update my drivers, which I have uninstalled my old drivers and done a clean install. Still gives me the same message, telling me that there was a problem with the installation of my drivers. I've restarted the computer after each reinstall of the GPU drivers  I've installed the latest drivers for my motherboard and my CPU, I've factory reset my quest, I've reinstalled the Oculus software, I've tried different USB 3.0 and 3.1 ports, nothing has worked. Same problem, it tells me there's an issue with my GPU drivers. 

I do notice that when I tried connecting it, inside the Quest it was on the loading screen for a bit, then it prompted me with a message saying that some file had stopped running, although I haven't been able to get back to that screen since and I can't remember what the file name was, but that was before I factory reset the Quest.

My hardware is a GeForce GTX 1070, a Ryzen 5 2600 and 16 GB of ram, I'm also using the Anker USB C to USB 3.0 cable, so I'm sure that's not the problem, but at this point I have no idea what is a problem and what isn't a problem. Another thing I notice is that I was able to start up a Steam VR game (Pavlov VR) and the game displayed on my monitor, and when I looked around in the headset on the monitor it looked around too, but inside the headset it was completely black. 

But the headset is still tracking, it's not just displaying a black screen because you can get close to the guardian barrier and it'll show the grid that your getting too close. But at this point I'm completely lost and tired of installing and uninstalling drivers and software, not knowing what's  happening. 

If someone could help me with this I would wholeheartedly appreciate it as I was really looking forward to using the Oculus link when it came out, and any advice or even someone who is sharing the same problem would be a great help.

eGPUs over thunderbolt always perform slightly worse than the original GPU.
They perform considerably worse when you do not game on a an external monitor too, and rely on the laptops display. The reason for this is that the thunderbolt link has to send all the pci-e data to the GPU and then send every rendered frame uncompressed over the thunderbolt back to the laptops display.
It seems to me that this might even become worse when you use a quest link as that link is NOT an uncompressed stream (like a monitor or rift s for example) but a compressed stream that relies on the GPU. 
Does anybody know if indeed the rendered frame will in the case of the Quest link be sent back from the GPU to the cpu only to then be sent back to the GPU for compression??
If that is the case, the performance might be extra bad!!

After a hint from a thread like this i tried to unplug every other usb device to test for powershortcuts, and after that it was the only time the headset shown to function. This was when i got the sensor testing chance, but after that it wouldn't even come to this again either.

This was the first time I got to stream this game on my channel and had a lot of fun in doing so. 

This game is certainly both amusing and a great work out

They have certainly taken a unique path into the rhythm genre in virtual reality and i think its going to have an amazing potential with the addition of more maps, walls and custom maps being created as we speak ;)

I use the Oculus Rift, and have been having a problem of only getting an orange light with a black screen for a while, and when i put the headset on the light goes away and is still unresponsive. I used to be able to fix this by unplugging and plugging it back in, but after I updated my Driver to version 441.20 I have not been able to fix it this way.

When I start a game the light will switch to a blue/white color but the light goes away and I am faced with a black screen when I put the headset on. If the game mirrors to my computer, when the headset is off the controllers and headset are both tracked in the game, but once I put the headset on the controllers stop showing movement in the game, and I am still able to see nothing through the headset. I have tried running the Oculus repair, I have tried updating my drivers, I have unplugged and reset my computer multiple times to no avail, and I have even tried reinstalling the Oculus App. I looked at Windows Services and I tried to turn on the Oculus Library Service and I am met with this error.

Right off the start let me clear the air on my opinion and then I will explain.  Any game dependency failure that is in the gaming companies control is all fair game for reducing a games review, up to and including, reviews where you state you cannot physically play the game.

A lot of people don't understand exactly what they are buying and what a ""game"" truly is.   I hear things like how can you review a game that constantly crashes if you have never technically played it.  I will get to the explanation later but first let me describe all the aspects of a game you purchase.  The reason the explanation is necessary as most folks think a game is just the UI \[User Interface\]. Therefore, ""if you don't see the UI and have not actually played the game"" then the developers are off the hook right?  Not so fast!

Games have many dependencies that are required to run.  Let's look at servers first.  The part most people seem to focus on is the UI and Playability, but this is just one piece of the pie.  Increasingly games require game company servers to process log in requests and meld into the gaming experience often times in single player games.  This dependency is squarely on the game company and is inner twinned into the game just as much as any UI piece.  Just like quest turn ins need to work in a game, the dang game servers need to authenticate you.  Just as important.

PC's requirements are next on my list.  If your computer meets the minimum specs of a game and you are running the latest drivers, and you know it plays other similar games just fine with the same general rendering engine.  Crashes due to video rendering exceptions are squarely on the shoulders of the devs.  This dependency on rendering is arguably central to the games development and plays a critical role in the ability to even call itself a game to begin with.

3rd party references.  When a game incorporates 3rd party references into their project they are making this part of their game.  For example, if a game so decides to incorporate the Unity engine and for the sake of argument this 3rd party reference has more bugs than a bait store, then this surely is not the fault of the game developer right?  Wrong!  When you add 3rd party references you are on the hook that your product works with what ever version of the reference you developed against.

In summary a lot of dust was kicked up recently with the release of Stormland.  Folks getting sore about bad reviews due to the Oculus market place was not serving the game files directly.  If Oculus has owned up to the problem as something on their side then I feel that yes the bad reviews are in the wrong.  However, if it is found that the delivery of game files was jacked up because Stormland did not publish them properly, that is something else entirely.  It is my understanding that it was on the Oculus side.

Will I give a 1 star review because of launch server issues that were temporary.  Not a chance, will I deduct a star from a review because the game company was at fault and the downtime was more than a few hours?  Yes I will.  If downtime\\jinky servers last more than a day or two I deduct more stars.

Launch does not just mean the UI is done... It means the ENTIRE package of game is Tested and released.  Not released then tested.

This would be my first VR headset. I was originally set on the Rift S until I heard about Oculus Link. I've tried to do as much research as I could on my own. I have a compatible graphics card according the chart on the Oculus website and I have the current recommended cable. From what I've gathered, it seems the Quest should work with games both on the Oculus Store and SteamVR, so it essentially functions as a Rift S, but it can also be portable if I wanted. I'm also aware it's still in beta, but I don't really mind waiting for a bit for the full release. With all of that, it seems to me that the Quest is clearly the better option. As I said though, I'm new to VR, and I would rather not find out after buying that there was another factor I didn't know about or take into account. Are there any reasons why I might still want to get the Rift S over the Quest?",oculus,"With Oculus Link, are there any reasons to get the Rift S over the Quest?",https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dyr430/with_oculus_link_are_there_any_reasons_to_get_the/,True,submission

It covers two methods for protecting the internal ribbon cable inside the headset. Which is a common cause of audio failure. It also shows some examples of how to protect the headset cable as well from common faults.

**Ribbon Cable Protection**

**Half Tape** - Stops the right slide retracting into the headset more than it needs to. This can be applied where the headset slide springs naturally stop. Better still it can also be applied at the resting point of the headset user. If multiple people use the headset find the resting point of the smallest headed person and tape there. This half tape will protect the internal ribbon cable from the stresses of pushing the slide in.

**Full Tape** - Stops the right slide from moving completely. Only really recommended for headsets that are not shared. This should provide the best protection as the ribbon cable will never have any movement. Even with a shared headset this full tape method can still be viable as there is usually enough pmovement on the left slide to adjust for similar head sizes.

**Headset Cable Protection**

Another common failure point for the headset cable is where it is clipped to the headset. Some users experience kinks at this point and the cable fails. These two taping techniques provide additional strength and as an added bonus give more movement of the left slide for people who are using the ""Full Tape"" method described earlier.

**Left Side Slack** - With a small amount of cable slack to allow for left slide movement add a few rolls of tape on the headset side of the clip to stop the cable sliding into the clip. This slack helps a lot for people using the ""Full Tape"" ribbon cable protection.

""Left Side Strength"" - Add a few rolls of electrical tape on the cable behind and to the rear of the clip to provide additional strength and protect against kinks.

Hopefully these last two tips help people keep their cable in good health until Oculus [start selling cables again for the CV1](https://oculus.uservoice.com/forums/918556-oculus-rift-s-and-rift/suggestions/38506144).",oculus,PSA - Rift CV1 Longevity Tips - For Both Ribbon and Headset Cable,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dxz1cz/psa_rift_cv1_longevity_tips_for_both_ribbon_and/,True,submission

These games look amazing (haven’t played them yet as I’m on Quest). Watching gameplay footage and reviews made me think that this genre is just perfect for VR and looks like it offers the most intuitive way of playing an RTS. 

But when I tried to search for what I assumed was going to be a decent library of similar titles I came up empty handed. Did I miss something, or are there just not many out there? I found one called Landfall which looked ok, but I really couldn’t find anything else.

I got it running last night and it's amazing!  I'm playing the Brutal Doom mod and the gameplay and shooting are on another level.  Just running and gunning and blowing things into bloody chunks.  Having just played through the game pancake version with KB+M... it's a whole different experience in VR.

The only problem is half of the buttons on the Touch controllers are not mapped, and there doesn't seem to be a way to remap them.

Now, in all likelyhood it's just a misnomer, but confirming requires dissection of a cable. Cutting the cable itself should reveal at least one optical fibre (likely multiple) though these are very fine and may not be immediately obvious without a microscope (especially if there are metallic strands run along with the fibre itself, which may appear to just be a regular wire at first glance). Cutting open the connectors would reveal if the required laser diodes and photodiodes are present.

Here is a note from Klives:

&gt;Welcome to BladeSkill! A OVRRPG where you can carve your mark on the landscape, explore the immense lands, go shopping in the large towns, buy your own homes or rent a inn for the night, or fight for loot and gear in the Dungeons. Aim the be the most powerful, or enjoy the social events at bars or taverns. The map is made up of 5 areas: Tundra, Forest, Desert, Red Desert and Mountains. Go climbing up a mountain, or climb over lava in a dungeon. It's your world to conquer. The game is in development, and the developers are working hard to add lots more features, like horses, pets and other activites. If you would like to support the game, we will be opening a 'Contributor' program later, where you can get ingame perks, like a special pet or a vanity item, spoilers for the next updates or credits to spend in the Cosmetic Store. Make your mark, work together, and explore in the new lands of BladeSkill, coming soon at [https://discord.gg/5uK2SxJ](https://discord.gg/5uK2SxJ)

I've now witnessed a complete setup, with someone very well versed in Unity.  I'm *shocked* at how many steps need to be taken (installing packages, etc) in order to just get to a place where you can jump into VR and control things. 

Unreal has a template VR project, with everything already set up.  A user just needs to load up a scene, hit play, and they have full VR functionality right off the bat.  The user can even borrow scripts attached to objects to place on other objects in their own works, to make the same capabilities available for their own purposes.

Honest question; what is the advantage of teaching VR production using Unity, as opposed to Unreal?  I work at a major institution that teaches the arts, and want to push our department towards developing for VR projects.  After watching substitute teacher try to walk an entire class to set up their first VR project in Unity, I felt like pulling my hair out.   I told the teacher about how simple Unreal was, and he grimaced.  I have an appointment with him tomorrow to show him Unreal.

Anyone who is teaching Unity / VR in a higher educational environment, I'd LOVE your input here.

* Oculus PC app was 1.43 (some articles say 1.44, not true)
* Quest version 11.0
* Try any USB 3.0 cable and see if it works. For my test I just had I think it was a Samsung S10 cable? Not sure. Random USB 3 I had that works.
* Steam VR (YES IT WORKS!) 1.8.20 is what I used.
* I have a 1070 and it works just like I was playing on the Rift S

**Visuals:**

First, it looks WAY better than I thought. I DON'T CARE what you think of OLED, it is so much better for darker games. Fight me.

FPS IS 72. It doesn't affect me much on Asgard's Wrath. More on the FPS and Tracking later though...

First impressions from others in September I heard when they snapped their head, they noticed black where the image was catching up to render? I did not see that at all.

A small thing that idk if it's what's happening but the rendering of images on each eye seemed off? Idk if it's because of the headset moving, as its heavy on front and not as attached as the Rift, but I tried just a Quest game and it didn't seem to have the same problem... Maybe the render is off a bit when its decoding the image, but turning my head fast seemed to make the visuals separate from each eye. (Someone test and confirm please).

**Latency:**

Again with the decoding rendering whatever, the picture looks connected and consistent when you turn your head. I was amazed.

Tracking Latency though... If you don't know, the tracking of the controllers is actually lower than the refresh rate of the Quest. I *believe* its 60 or 50 depending on the lighting you have. Either way, if you've played on the PC before, prepare to have a little bit of a heavier/floppy delay to the controllers... You do get use to it though.

**Feats:**

STEAM VR WORKS! It registers as a Rift S, or at least it shows the graphics of a Rift S.

Controllers are the same and all work. Whatever is paired to the Quest is what works automatically.

Oculus menus are the desktop version. Oculus Home, store, desktop access, and everything.

You can switch between the Quest Menus and the Rift menus through settings.

ALSO 3DOF mode works! Don't know what you would use it for but there you have it.",oculus,Hopefully answer most questions - Oculus Link General Info and First Impressions!,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dy9ja3/hopefully_answer_most_questions_oculus_link/,True,submission

For quite some time, I've been unable to get my laptop working with my Rift S. I had tried pretty much every recommendation short of getting a replacement. (It always worked beautifully on my desktop. My laptop was an MSI GP63 Leopard 8RF. (AKA the GTX 1070 Leopard). Last week, I got a displayport to USB-C (thunderbolt) adapter in a last ditch effort to get my Rift S working on my laptop. Nope. Nothing. So I was doubtful that the Oculus Link would work. 

Then I saw a headline stating that the Link beta was out. I immediately got to testing, used the right-angled USB-C to USB -C cord that came with the Quest, and nope... Nothing. There was a big, red X in setup, but I hovered over the X and it said something along the lines of ""Note that the USC-C cord that came with the Quest is not compatible."" Disappointed, I immediately remembered that I had bought some various-USB to USB-C adapters in the past ([Like this](https://www.amazon.com/nonda-Adapter-Thunderbolt-Aluminum-Indicator/dp/B015Z7XE0A/ref=sr_1_9?crid=1LMQ7BIXVP0FI&amp;keywords=usb+a+to+c&amp;qid=1574125469&amp;sprefix=usb+a+to+%2Caps%2C153&amp;sr=8-9)) and tried that. The setup immediately worked and I was testing out VR games in no time.

As for the picture quality, the quest is noticeably a lower resolution, I assume from the streaming, but it still looks and plays great. Needless to say, I'm super pumped to find SOME solution.

With that in mind, could I just treat it like a PC headset and ignore the standalone capabilities?

My dilemma happens when on one hand I can buy the Quest for $400 and use it immediately, anywhere I want, but on the other hand the Rift S is better overall for PC VR Experiences. If I got the rift S I would have to upgrade my current PC a bit and it would cost about $600 just to upgrade. That's upwards of $1,000 just to use the Rift S, but I would eventually upgrade my PC anyways. I wanted to hear other peoples ideas as Black Friday is coming up soon and I can't decide. With oculus link coming as well I would have to upgrade my PC to use it as a PC VR Headset anyways, but I've heard the link isn't going to be as good as a PC only headset. Is it overall better to save some money and buy the quest and use it w/out the PC, OR is it definitely worth it to upgrade my PC for the overall performance improvement of the Rift S?

I'm going to take a different approach this time and create a list of things I've already done. First, I'm going to post a few screenshots of my current settings.

We had a blast talking to the people who checked it out, and I genuinely have friends that I met in GonzoVR that I'm closer to than my meatspace-friends.

It's certainly true that our user numbers were never very large, but in the end that wasn't the main issue. We always felt that the first priority was to create something that people really sustainably enjoyed, and once we had that we would then focus on getting more broadcasters and users. The big problem was that the kind of experience that everyone enjoyed the most: small broadcasts with 3-6 people, could never be economically valid for a broadcaster. We tried a few things to foster larger groups while still giving everyone a chance to talk, but there is only so much speaking time to be distributed. As soon as someone felt that they weren't contributing, they would leave.

We're making a new application now that builds off of what we've learned that people want, and the kinds of social groups that lead to the most enjoyable experiences.

Anyway, as a final note, I just want to say thank you to everyone who took the time to try GonzoVR out, and leave a review.

So, of course, the reason for this post is I need help finding out if my PC can handle something like the rift or if I need to just settle with the quest. I googled, found mass heaps of shit and messy articles, only to find out the compatibility test was taken down for whatever reason. What I am left with is just the list of needed things in my PC to handle VR, however, I'm not a tech genius and I am not aware at all of what's in my PC. Is there some way of me finding out if my PC can work with VR or possibly all the parts I have to compare to what's on the Oculus site.

&gt;Dear Customer,
&gt;Since you previously purchased or rented movies on the Oculus Movie Store, we wanted to inform you of some changes in our service. We’re replacing the Oculus Movie Store with FandangoNOW. Beginning May 2020, the Oculus Movie Store, and all of its contents within your library will be removed.

&gt;To get you started with our new partner, we’d like to offer you $19.99 USD in FandangoNOW credit.

&gt;FandangoNOW features over 90,000 movies and shows that Oculus users can stream with no monthly fee. Just pay as you go and rent or buy the latest releases before they’re available on monthly-subscription streaming services.

I'm new to this VR world (never had any VR headset on my head) and I'm on the fence of:

\- buying used CV1 with 3 sensors (40% of  new oculus rift S price)

\- buying Rift S

\- not buying rift at all

[Here's my potential setup for CV1](https://imgur.com/a/nVYuSUY) \- rectangle is my play area, circles are sensors, dashed circles are potential places for sensors if I were to use extensions cables. Height of all sensors is  approximately  1m.

My question are:

\- Can this setup work well?

\- Since cables will run through my whole room I can't have sensors placed permanently in those spots. Will I have to calibrate / set play area each time I clean up and then place them in he same / similar spots? (If yes - how much time does it take?)

\- Can I use cheap USB 3.0 extension cables?

\- Used CV1 will be propably from year 2016/17 - do those things have history of breaking right after warranty runs out?

I’m a casual gamer in a sense I don’t play often (not that I like casual games).

I want to buy one of these two and I don’t know which one I should chose.

I’m more of a sci-fi guy so Stormland would be pretty obvious but from the reviews I saw, everyone seems to think it’s too repetitive and  if there is one thing I hate in a game, it’s doing the same thing over and over.

Is it that bad?  I don’t care about post-ending, I just want to play the story.


On the other hand, AG seems very good despite  the fantastic theme. My only fear is there is too much crafting and collecting ressources involved (I don’t like this at all because those games are often very long and I don’t have a lot of time to play).

I dont need them to convert to alloy, i need them to stay so i wont have to upgrade again/look for eon buds.

It really gives a feeling that the game just reset itself and you need to start from scratch. (AI is still as smart as a shoe)

Definitely not holding up to all the hype that was around this title.
Feels more like Robo Recall with the option for free roam than a full standalone game.

Compared to the awe i was playing AW and the complexity of it, the more i play stormland i just feel more and more ripped off. 

On the upside the CO-OP is really fun and hopefully they will fix it so if me and my friend are on different mission everything i collect and upgrade WILL be saved (even tough it did save me finishing the cycle so i am not entirely sure how it works)

For everyone who were yet to buy this title, wait for a discount as the 40$ just NOT worth it.

Also couple of bugs found in CO-OP:
1. If you and your friend are trying to hold the same item at the same time that item just becomes stuck.
2. Sometimes instead of dying you just see a black screen. You can still move but can not interact with anything.

I'm hoping the differences between the Rift S Touch controllers and the original Rift Touch controllers aren't causing the issue, but this doesn't seem to be the case.

From what I can tell,  [Auto Oculus Touch](https://github.com/rajetic/auto_oculus_touch) is receiving the controller input perfectly. The example scripts for mouse controller and the test window show the joystick/triggers/buttons all functioning as expected. The problem is that installing [vJoy](http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/site/index.php/77-vjoy/84-homepage-v200) and using the `oculus_touch_vjoy.ahk` script will not show any of the inputs received by vJoy (observing the vJoy Monitor), even though the other scripts are still working.

Has anyone else had success with this solution one recent hardware and software updates?

I bought a Rift S last week and it's been working great. I've played Beat Saber a lot, and I've had no problems.

However, I went to play today and everything started going south. Firstly, I had to update the drivers and firmware. No big deal; everything went smoothly and it was just a mild inconvenience. Secondly, my touch controllers were both on low battery (I was still using the ones Oculus provided) and I had to change them. That was kind of annoying and I'll probably start taking the batteries out after I'm done every time (one week?! I know it uses a bit of power constantly listening for the Rift to wake up but still).

&lt;/rant&gt;&lt;support&gt;

Finally, I got into Beat Saber, went to play a level, and my left touch controller kept losing its tracking. It would be fine for a bit, then it would freeze even when I was still swinging my arm then jump to its place and freeze, etc. This never happened to me before. I'm thinking it is the firmware update but I'm not sure. Has anybody else had this issue recently?

I've had the CV 1 since shortly after it came out, love it, works flawlessly.  Recently the cable started to fray so I decided to upgrade to the S.

Out of the box this thing hasn't worked.  The headset didn't track the controllers, the hands just stay stationary and rotate when I move them.  The picture stutters and just kind of wanders around where it feels like it.  At one point I put it on and just kept launching straight up into the air then rubberbanding back to the ground and doing it all over again.  Sound is SUPER quiet even with everything turned all the way up in both Windows and the Oculus software and it doesn't seem to work in most games. Passthrough flashes static a few times a second.  I've been trying everything I've found online so far and as I fix one thing another breaks and I'm just going in circles.

I thought I figured out the tracking problem and all seemed to be working then the screen started blacking out for several seconds accompanied by static in the speakers.  I repaired the Oculus software and the black scree/static went away but now the tracking problem is back and on top of that it's telling me ""something went wrong can't track headset"" regardless of where I plug in.  It told me there wasn't enough light so I turned on the lights but they're too bright and blow out the camers when I look in their direction so I stuck some light diffusers over them to no avail.  Tried turning those off and using natural light from the windows, no luck. 

Stuff I've tried so far off the top of my head: 
Reinstalling the rift software

Making sure USB sleep was disabled

Switching through the USB ports from the two 3.0 ports and one 3.1 port on the MoBo AND the 3.0 ports on the USB card I used for the sensors(which are unplugged from the PC to void conflicts).

Switching display ports

Disabling/closing any/all tertiary software like iCUE, nVidia Experience, Steel Series Engine, and Plex 

Reseating the cable in the Headset

Disabling Windows Defender virus and firewall entirely(it was a suggestion I saw to stop it from blocking access to the camera)

Trying to get his thing running has just been one disaster after another and I'm about ready to just shove it back in the box and return it but I really love VR so I'd really like to get this thing working.  At this point I'm just so pissed off at it that I can't think straight enough to try troubleshooting on my own anymore.

Somebody who has any wild ideas that aren't already plastered all over the internet help me out please?

SADLY, we acknowledged that those who have Windows system language set to language other than English may have encountered consistent crash with the new version. But if you change the Windows system language to English, there will be no crash anymore.

Our engineers are working hard on a fix now and we will release a new version as soon as possible.

We appreciate if you could spread the word when you see other people experience the crash.

Here is what’s new on version 0.2.1:

\[Fixed Bug\] Fixed some fisheye videos look blurry on the side.   
\[Fixed Bug\] Fixed pixelation on red object during video playback.   
\[Fixed Bug\] Fixed certain 180 videos shoot by Insta360 could be played once only.   
\[Feature\] New Advanced Settings:   
a. Curved Screen   
b. 3D L-R swap   
c. Playback Speed Adjustment   
d. AB loop   
f. Loop / Shuffle + Loop Playlist / Loop One / No Loop  
f. Image Adjust - Contrast   
g. Image Adjust - Saturation   
h. Adjust aspect ratio for Full SBS videos   
\[Optimization\] Support more characters on virtual keyboard (¿ ¥ € ￡· ° | \` \[ \]).

Playing stormland, you holster your weapons on your hips. That's all well and good. The problem is now, for whatever reason, they have chosen to make putting your hands ANYWHERE NEAR your hips give you a constantly refreshing endless vibration and hud notification about how much ammo you have. This happens from even the slightest movement of your hand. It is so bad that it makes putting your hands at your sides at any point during the game probably the most immersion breaking and annoying thing I've seen in a VR game.

Hey Guys. I did an Hour and a half stream last night of Insomniac Games VR title Stormland. It's nice to see one of the bigger developers jumping in to the VR world to show just how good VR gaming can be. From my time playing it so far I'd say it's up their with Asgard's wrath for most impressive VR title to date. You play as a Robot mysteriously re-awakened after being shut down witnessing memory fragments as you roam about a free open world. There are various missions to undertake from story to side mission, plenty of character upgrades, and I believe once the story ends there are weekly incursions from the evil Tempest faction. 

Since the game was built from the ground up for VR it's nice to see how a company like Insomniac deals with the various VR challenges like Traversal, UI, Inventory, Upgrades etc and I have to say they have come up with some really cool stuff! Your wrist has a compass on it that will help you find your objectives and as you pull away the fog of war the compass also begins to display a 3D hologram map which you can open up full scale to place custom way points on that looked like our mega map from the Division, it just feels so much more tangible in VR though.

The climbing works great in the game, however it's very basic in terms of climbing because you use like Magnetized equipment on your hands so you don't have to actually grab anything but for the context of the game it works, and you can use momentum of your arm swings to propel you higher which i liked.

Traversal in the game was WAY faster than most games allow which i was super happy with, usually other games have a slow walk speed because of motion sickness, where as this game has your default walk to be quite fast, you can then sprint on top of that, but you can also slipstream on the cloud/water vapor which has you going even faster, THEN you can even boost on top of that to increase your speed more AND THEN on top of THAT you can hit these electrical buoys which will give you a further boost, hit multiple in a row to max out your speed and it means you can traverse the world at high pace.

Flying/falling with style is also possible with outreached arms whilst leaping off of high ledges, and the game doesn't have an issue with verticality at all.

Combat was quite lite so far, with Stealth being possible (steal the health canisters from the enemy) or go in guns blazing, enemy A.I. seemed basic at this stage (early game though) but it was fun mowing them down. Reloading weapons/gaining health/boosts is done in a unique way, you essentially grab a matching gun to one you already have holstered, grab it with both hands and then tear it apart, this will automatically replenish ammo in your holstered weapon as long as it's the same type. This method is also used to regen your health if you can grab a health canister and tear it open you will regen your health.

Graphically the game is superb with excellent Environmental world building, Lore set up, character animations etc, It was super immersive, Though I did feel incredibly short compared to some of the 9 feet tall characters lol.

Music and Sound were also top notch as you'd expect from insomniac.

Overall I can't wait to jump back in to explore it more, Between this and Asgards wrath i think most of My Christmas Holidays will be spent in VR with the occasional break to play Jedi Fallen oder.",oculus,Stormland My early Thoughts,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dwnxca/stormland_my_early_thoughts/,True,submission

And although it's pretty obvious for us, VR enthusiasts, when we start talking about languages and subtitles inside the metaverse, things become a little less obvious to the point it's becoming a real problem for the mass adoption.

  
I'm a 43 y/o Spanish guy. I can talk English because I was lucky enough to have a family with some money to invest in my education.  But I guess I'm just in 15%-20% of the Spanish population (40% for Latin Americans???) who can maintain a conversation in another language.  And frankly, even if I can talk English in most normal situations, sometimes I'm struggling to fully understand English in a VR game/experience without the help of subtitles. 

  
VR is an ecosystem by itself. You are not in your room in front of your desktop, focusing just on the game character that is speaking to you. You are being distracted by the thousands of external noises the VR adds to the equation: your virtual hands, the environment, the interfaces, the action, other characters movements... instructions have to be crystal clear to allow somebody that doesn't speak fluently that language to know exactly what to do and how to do it in VR.

  
We are still learning how to do things inside VR. UX is a huge thing. So even for English spoken people, sometimes the experience is a little odd. Imaging that without understanding perfectly what the game is telling you to do.

  
STORMLAND has some bad reviews from the Spanish community across the world. ASGARD'S WRATH too. WILSON'S HEART received a lot of bad feelings back in the day. Almost all the AA VR games are inside that box from the very beginning. Those BAD REVIEWS are a Scream from us to be heard. It's the only way we can try to explain big studios that we need language or subtitles to play their VR games (play = purchase = spend money). 

  
I've asked Boz (VP AR/*VR* at Facebook) and Rubin personally, face to face, about this a couple of times. I've talked with Peter Hirschmann (Upcoming Medal of Honor VR title) about during the last Connect too. All of them understood that what makes something massive, spread across the world, is something accessible for everybody. Sadly, VR is not the case.

  
FYI, I know developers. Some friends have VR games published and even myself have a little ""one-man project"" selling at [itch.io](https://itch.io/) (both Spanish/English language) so I know the costs of all of this. That's why I will never, ever, blame indie developers. There's enough stress for them in the VR to ask them for more updates. But surely I can blame big pocket studios. 

Conclusion: Oculus, there are thousands of Spanish people, VR users, not buying your games. Not because they don't want them, not because they hate them, but because they can't understand them. And VR needs users. All of them. All of us.  Every damn user no matter where in the word he/she is.",oculus,Language/subtitles in Oculus Games should be mandatory (Stormland and other games bad reviews related),https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dwo5aw/languagesubtitles_in_oculus_games_should_be/,True,submission

I usually don't preorder (especially when there is no incentive to do so) but I was so impressed with StormLand during OC6 I thought I'll show my support for the Developer / Publisher - what harm would it be to demonstrate the level of support for what looks like a job well done.

Can't believe Oculus dropped the ball on their biggest release of the year.  Funnily enough I had issues with Asgard Wrath too (yes, I preordered there too) but that error was sorted much more quickly.

Contacting Oculus Support is no use either, they've no clue when it will be fixed all they can say is - we'll email you when its fixed.

Anyway, rant over, working in IT I understand that shit happens.

I went through at least 30 posts talking about Rift S vs Quest, but none of those really discussed what I wanted to know.

Well, let me introduce myself. I purchased a Quest from Best Buy 3 days ago. It indeed is my first VR that I got to own. While I really love all my VR experience(oh, man, those 360 degrees celestial videos are satisfying as fuck), I can't find it BEARABLE. Not even close to being comfortable, but rather unbearable.

I posted about this on Quest subreddit, and researched it too. People said that I've been wearing it wrong. I need to adjust right. So I did. It didn't help a single bit. Got a cheap alternative strap(which isn't DAS), didn't help either.

What's really sad now is, I fell in love with VR. I don't want to let go or wait more for it to develop further.

As much as I love the concept of not having a wire, I wish it could be more comfortable.

So, I have two options I'm considering now.

1.Mod(physically) the heck out of my Quest. That will cost me about $150.

2.Return(I have no hope, I shouldn't have bought it from Best Buy) or sell the Quest, and get the Rift S if it's WAY MORE comfortable.

I know that Rift S is more comfortable, according to people in this sub, and I believe it. I just want to know how much more(I know it's personal, and can't be numbered but still...).

And for sure, my quest will be quite comfortable after spending $150 for mods, but will it compete with Rift S' comfort? And there's that, the fucking Link cable will cost me about $80 too. Like never ending investing :/.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 tl;dr 

I have a Quest, and it's super uncomfortable. Thinking to mod the heck out of it or switch to the Rift S. I don't care about any other aspect, and read many comparison posts. All I care about is the ultimate comfort.

Oculus Rift CV1 

\---------------------------------------------------

I owned a PSVR a month after its release and kept it for about a year, then I wanted to get more out of VR so I invested in a better PC and an Oculus Rift CV1 which I've had for several years now. I've had a great time with it but I'd like to take yet another step further, if possible, to get more out of VR. I'll be honest, I've been eyeing a Valve Index for quite some time, mainly because it ''seems'' to be a step in the right direction in terms of getting more out of VR and increasing that immersion factor. I think the whole finger tracking of the Index Controllers are really cool, but I don't know if it's $1,000 cool, you know? I'm also interested in full body tracking, I think it's really cool technology. 

I love VR, I want to keep investing in it and showing my support. I'm proud to be part of the VR community and I guess what I'd like to know is; What are my options at the moment? I'm hoping that people with a Valve Index can chime in, and tell me their experience or offer some insight on what I should do.

Next problem was with shoulder spacing and body location, my characters chest was just straight up not lined up with my actual body at all. if I ever bent down or crouched I would clip through the body and couldn't see past my character. And my arms were coming out of the headset, not my shoulders. pretty garbage feeling to have in a game that was supposedly top tier.

I wanted one so bad and just to skip unneeded info I got my first VR, samsung gear vr. I think it was the coolest thing ever. I liked watching netflix sometimes but mainly the cool games i could buy. Then I found out about Virtual Virtual Reality, it started off as an amazing game until the part where you put on a headset in the game and you get put into this ""danger/warning"" box. Basically that's how the game tells the story and you get the main tool of the game but when that situation game up it scared me. This was a little over a year ago. After I was over the whole phone vr. I graduated from high school and got my first ever real gaming pc. About 3 months after, I bought the rift s which I was so excited to use and play with. I bought beat saber, and a load of other vr games and whatnot. The only issue is, there was always one issue I had with most games, except beat saber somehow. I enjoyed big parts of the games but strangely enough I would get anxiety or feel actually fear from being in the headset playing games like, Pavlov VR, from seeing the players and the death screens and sadly for Vivecraft(Minecraft VR mod) swimming in the water would freak me out. FNaF VR scared me shitless and it wasn't even the actual gameplay, it'd be things like the start menu, game selection and the environment. This is also an issue with anything that has to do with water/swimming or space in VR. IT'S SO STRANGE! I have never feared any of these things in real life nor do I feel I do now. I don't think I'm claustrophobic because no matter what size room I'm in, whether it'd be vr or real life. Being by myself in a big or small room scares/traumatizes me and I get paranoid. I really want to play vr because it genuinely looks fun but my anxiety and fear prevent from playing anything in them or just viewing it. I legit just bought Megaton Rainfall to play in vr and i legit couldn't get past the menu screen and immediately took off the headset. I don't know if any of you have experienced this or know what would help because I tried looking up what issues with myself and vr but all I got were ""How VR could help anxiety"" from 50 different media outlets.... it clearly isn't making me feel better",oculus,Having Anxiety and Fear from VR,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dw7ctf/having_anxiety_and_fear_from_vr/,True,submission

I'm mainly interested in sim games a la Elite Dangerous, Assetto Corsa and such, but I'm sure I'll play a few VR specific titles too because why not?

My specs are:

* Asus Z97 Pro Gamer Intel Z97 (Socket 1150) DDR3 ATX Motherboard
*   Intel Core i5-4690K 3.50GHz (Devil's Canyon) Socket LGA1150 Processor - I did OC this, but I forget how much, maybe 4GHz ish?

This means that for a game like asgards wrath you have to have 130gb free for the staging folder, then when the download inevitably fails you have to have another 130gb free for it to resume downloading where it left off. 260gb free for a single game install. The launcher should check staging folder to see that its already allocated space and discover the files there. 

also the way patches are implemented is ridiculous. for asgards wrath's first patch the total download size was only 1.2gb but the launcher requires you to have 130gb free space just to start downloading the 1.2gb patch, so again 260gb space needed just to download a 1.2gb patch. this is ridiculous and unacceptable. i'd rather wait an extra 10 minutes after a download for the launcher to do a game file integrity check than have to spend 30 minutes moving 120gb worth of files to another hard drive just so i can begin a 1.2gb download then another 30 minutes moving them back.

I'm not really new to Oculus Rift, but I recently had need to reinstall Windows on my computer. I've got an SSD with a little bit of life left, but I don't want to push it if I can avoid it. If it can't be helped, it isn't the end of the world. I want to reinstall Oculus Rift software, but it wants to download 7 and a half gigabytes of data to my computer. I have a platter drive I'd like to store the files onto, but my efforts to tell Oculus to use this folder have come up in vein. I tried a few things, and wondered if anyone has any suggestions?

I first tried looking up command line switches to see if I can change the folder using a command line parameter. The only one I found was /drive, so I specified my E drive here (/drive=E:) and it says it wants at least 21.7 gigs of space free. I have about 4 and a half terabytes free, so I think it *should* meet the requirements.

After that failed, I tried creating a junctioned folder to the E: folder I want the files to copy to. Oculus nuked my junctioned folder and created a new one on the SSD, then started downloading to the new folder it created.

So I tried using attrib in cmd to set the junctioned folder as readonly, and Oculus renamed the folder to something else, then created a new folder.

Instead of using a junctioned folder, I tried something similar with symbolic links. Same story.

I then tried opening Disk Manager, and mounting the entire hard drive to the Oculus download folder to see if that would work. It did not. I'm not sure if Disk Manager's way of mounting drives to a folder is the same as a symbolic link or whatnot, but Oculus deleted the link to the platter drive, and created a new folder on the SSD, and started to download to that.

So yeah, any suggestions? I think I really want to make this happen because I hate when programs try to tell me how they want me to do something. It's just a new location for temporary files, not hacking the binaries to cheat the systems, FFS.",oculus,How do I change the download folder for the setup files?,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dwdr9r/how_do_i_change_the_download_folder_for_the_setup/,True,submission

What is Dement?

Dement is an open world survival horror game that has been in development for three years, and is available in early access now. Currently, the game has four of eight chapters, with most of the open world available. Throughout the early access period, we intend to pepper in new areas, weapons, and side quests while we continue to toil on getting the last four chapters done- and of course, fix any and all reported bugs. Purchase now and you will get access to ALL Dement content in the future, and be able to participate in the early access period. Suggestions are welcome; some have been made and already implemented!

&amp;#x200B;

Who is Paracytik Entertainment?

Paracytik Entertainment consists of mainly two people; one coder/designer and one writer. We hope to one day grow into something bigger, and to bring rich, fulfilling experiences to players everywhere. We want to be a part of a better gaming industry- one that focuses on games as art, moving stories, and engaging gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I expect from the demo?

The demo skips the prologue, and is the first three quarters or so of the first chapter on a 45 minute timer. The main menu, tutorial, and loading screens do not count towards the 45 minutes. If you die, half of the time since your last save will be returned to you. The first melee and ranged weapon will be provided immediately to speed up initial play. Expect to spend at least an hour playing this demo! If you get to ""The End of the Road"", tweet us a screenshot @paracytik for a congratulatory shout out! Good luck ;)

(For example this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1UBlJTSU\_4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1UBlJTSU_4) ). Apparently you can't always aim down sights as close to your eyes as you want due to the new trackers? Do you agree with this or is it exaggerated? 

FPS is one of the genres I play the absolute most and always have, and I don't expect that to change going into VR. I'm a university student so going for the high-end headsets like Valve Index is not an option and I'm not really interested in saving up either, as I want to try it asap.

So my question is, do you believe it would be a better choice for me to buy a Rift CV1 instead? How big is the difference in image quality and the trackers otherwise? Since it's cheaper I can tolerate it not being AS crisp, but if it's the difference between your eyes hurting or not - or very noticeable lag or not - that's obviously a different thing.

I'm debating between a laptop and a tower PC (maybe miniATX). We will need to take the rig on location and while for some shots we will be moving (eg: car scenes), in most situations we will have a ""basecamp"" with access to power. If we were operating off of battery, we could probably get some external battery solution (car battery with inverter?) as have done before. The ideal scenario is that we could plug the Rift S into the computer so we can look at the live stitching in VR. We are also considering a multi-screen layout with 3 to 5 monitors so that the crew can look at the VR together... in that case, it almost makes me think we should just go with a tricked out tower PC. I don't know which software they're going to end up using but I assume that it will be as or more processor intensive than like Premiere or After Effects if that gives any comparison.

I have posted a video review for those interested that includes stock footage from Insomniac and Oculus and no additional spoilers.  You can find that at: https://youtu.be/5TOW4Y5kBtM




Starting with a game mechanic that involved extending your arms out in front of you like Superman and squeezing the grip buttons to ""soar"" for locomotion, Insomniac built off of that launching pad and have developed a rich, immersive world where you are dropped in to your robotic avatar following a time of conflict where teh once vibrant world falls partially to ruin.




You begin the game with only fragments of your memory intact and set out on an epic adventure to uncover the fate of your friends and reclaim your world from an enemy force known as the Tempest.  How you go about the tasks is partially left in your hands, as going in guns blazing may result in the need to farm alloy elements or recycle weapon parts for more ammo.  Going in using stealth techniques allows you to conserve ammo and sometimes defeat enemies with alternative traps that have been organically placed in the environment rather than consuming a lot of ammunition.




I felt like the gameplay choices presented were reminiscient of a mix of Metal Gear Solid and The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.  Free climbing and exploration as you soar across the clouds and unlock and ascend from your base camp to progressively more challenging and advanced regions of the Stormland is encouraged and I found that not going directly for objectives sometimes lead to better tech and weapon upgrades without the cost of fabricating them at a workbench.




There are simple crafting and skill tree mechanics unlocked as you follow the story path.  You can rip your arms right out of the socket and place it on a workbench to upgrade or find small device upgrades that you simply drop on your body to install. You can craft items using alloy materials farmed throughout the Stormland.  Skill tree points are earned using squeezed fruit and plant buds. These technology and skill upgrades aren't all required but can help you get a bit of a leg up on the enemy as the combat intensity increases as you ascend to higher levels of the world.



Like the technology and skill progression tree upgrades, co-op multiplayer is also an optional unlock in the world that is not needed to finish the main guided storyline.  I initially completed the main story playing solo and revisited a portion of the  early game with a co-op partner to help them to progess further in their game.  I felt like co-op didn't really add much for me to the overall adventure but if your co-op partner is struggling with a challenge, having help from a more experienced player can go a long way in helping them reach the end of the guided path and the next portion of the Stormland journey.




Extending your arms and soaring like Superman across the clouds was an exhilarating experience in VR and the limited use for travel between islands also makes that action not feel like a chore when you use it throughout the game.  I'm glad the game doesn't center on those mechanics for the majority of the game.



After completing the guided story adventure, the game enters an ever changing cycling progression, where your goal is to defeat and capture an enemy stronghold within the week long cycle and each time you finish that cycle, the next cycle has progressively more challenging enemies.  While the main guided storyline took me just over six hours to complete, the cycling world can keep players revisiting and potentially playing more cooperatively with a friend for those that fall in love with the world and the gameplay mechanics. Dedicated players who complete the cycling world several times and are able to increase enemy escalation difficulty to 2 are rewarded with a special ending
for finishing. At the time of this review, it wasn't yet possible for players to unlock the special ending.




For over a year, I've crossed paths with multiple demos of Stormland at trade shows and gaming conventions and even having played through the majority of the first hour of the game at those shows, I was still highly impressed by the world Insomniac have crafted.  Weather, flora, fauna, land, air and water effects including both graphics and spatial audio made me feel like I was truly embodying my android character in the game and was one of the most immersive experiences I have had thus far.  Seeing your character's shadow cast across a land mass also remarkably added a lot to that feeling of embodiment.  



The game ran great on my slightly older spec i7-6700 with Nvidia GTX 980Ti and 16GB of RAM. I was able to record gameplay at medium settings using Oculus Mirror but also able to bump the graphics settings up to Ultra with only minimal reprojection.  I found the medium settings were adequate for giving me full immersion into the world.




I played through the main storyline mainly in a seated position but sometimes switched to a standing room scale setup.  I played portions of the game using an original Rift with a front facing setup and found myself drifting a bit outside of the boundaries of the sensors infrequently.  While fully playable in this configuration, I recommend a room scale sensor setup with a Rift or playing the game using a Rift S or Quest with Oculus Link.  With Rift S, I had no issues with gameplay, better graphical fidelity with easier to read text prompts and did not experience any controller occlusion issues, which I had previously experienced during a play session at PAX East 2019 with an earlier demo build of the game.




I felt connected to the early portions of the storyline as a lonely android trying to make their place and reclaim their world from the evil Tempest.  As I progressed further into the story, I identified with the character development and progression and felt like the six hour journey felt just right for mastering the skills needed to take on the end game content of the cycling world.  Insomniac Games have built an immersive VR world that engaged me as a player to keep playing and varied the play mechanics enough that missions and exploration never felt repetitive.  The story's cinematic narrative clicked for me and I felt like I was a part of a science fiction universe, with human artifacts,
audio logs and scans of items adding to the narrative and world building.  Going off of the beaten path and exploring islands not tied to the main story missions lead to plenty of surprise encounters and discoveries.  While I don't tend to prefer games that fall into a first person shooter genre, Stormland left enough choice in my hands as a player to make conscious choices to only engage the enemy with weapons when necessary for my character's survival.  It was nice to have that choice in a game rather than inflicting violence being the core of the game.


At $39.99, even if you only play the six hour main storyline, I felt like Stormland provides a good value for what it delivers.  It is a good title that will be fantastic for new VR adopters to jump into and immerse themselves in an alien world.  It is also a great title for those who are now VR veterans who are looking for a solid game to occupy their time.  I'm not certain that the cycling world will add hundreds of hours of gameplay or that co-op will be the way many want to share their adventure but I loved the time I've spent surfing across the clouds and hope that you will too.",oculus,STORMLAND - A Spoiler Free Review in video and text form,https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dvs5ia/stormland_a_spoiler_free_review_in_video_and_text/,True,submission

**Stormland Press Review:**

Gameplay **Video Footage will be up at 12PM EST. I'll be adding to this post and replying to any questions to the best of our ability. (Youtube Link Here)**

Stormland is a big, created for-VR game that will launch on November 14, 2019. 

Created by developer Insomniac Games ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomniac\_Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomniac_Games)) it is their 4th VR game and it shows. 

Myself and Ronnie spent about a week and a half playing the version of the game that was provided to press outlets. Ask US ANYTHING!

What is this game most like: Lone Echo meets Climbey meets Robo Recall meets Halo meets Borderlands. 

You are an Android. You have weapons. You can climb on most anything. You skid along from island to island and high speeds in the Stormland environment. 

This is what should be considered a 2nd gen/wave VR game. Insomniac Games has taken every possible lesson from their previous games and all other proven VR concepts of the last 3+ years in gaming and put it all to use here.

Pros:

Visuals are top notch and what is to be expected for a “AAA VR Game” 

Graphics performance was **very good**. With an i7 6700k &amp; GTX 1080 on a Rift CV1 we saw a solid 90FPS at the default HIGH settings. Its not liquid smooth as there is a ton on elements on screen at once. The worlds are extremely populated with objects and plant life. The environment is AMAZING!

Sound is also outstanding with a rich and vibrant array of high quality weapon and environment sounds. 

Body (android) presence is outstanding and holds up to games like Lone Echo.

This is a Full featured AAA studio Insomniac Games VR game with everything that you would expect on quality.

Controls have every option you could want with forward motion, acceleration, snap &amp;smooth turning, comfort mode, HUD tweaks, left/right hand dominance and seated play options. All baked in from the start. 

   
 

Ripping apart guns and equipment reminds us of Robo Recall, which is awesome and it feels great. 

   
 

Climbing in game is freaking awesome and flinging your body upward to gain elevation and a better surprise attack point is equally awesome. 

   
 

Weapon interactions while it takes a bit to get used to is still quite intuitive. I don’t love dropping a weapon on the ground accidentally in VR games and Stormland makes clever use of the hover where you let go effect, even if only for a moment. You can force grab almost anything and it makes for a solid feeling even during hectic combat sequences. Weapon placement on your body is also a solid A-plus with the game taking care of some of the more annoying aspects of position locking rather making for a close enough is good and snap placement of any weapon you have. Dual wielding is easy, maybe almost to easy in hindsight. There is no reloading mechanic however any picked up weapons can be literally ripped apart by hand and its ammo is automatically distributed to the correct smg/shotgun/sniper rifle etc. The game uses the rip this apart mechanic a lot and its well done. Grenades and health packs are worn on you Android body. You will readily be asked to rip off body parts in order to upgrade them which is a very cool and immersive element to Stormland. 

Cons:

Not a huge con but this is NOT a jump in and play for the 1st time VR game. It has very in-depth movement and gameplay mechanics. That being said for me the combat seemed like I was stuck on a NORMAL or EASY mode. It was not impossible to be killed but only happened to me once in gameplay (that was when I **discovered** how to activate a grenade on my chest). You may consider this a Pro (as do we). 

   
 

Weapons dropped on the ground (by you) disappear pretty quickly. More than once a dropped sniper rifle pretty much disappeared almost instantly as we fumbled around to combine/shift our dual smg config to something else. Weapons are hip mounted so each new player MUST calibrate. Good news is that its fast and easy. The game guesses alot on weapon placement and 98% of the time gets it right on what you were intending to do/place. 

   
 

The story has both light hearted and dark elements as these are sentient androids that you witness being basically slaughtered. Would I let me 6 year old check out the game, probably not. By 10-year-old, sure. Your mileage may very. TBH some parts of the plot seemed innocent (in a good way) while other concepts were dark. I feel the story is excellent but it may not be everyone’s cup of heated robot hydraulic fluid. Again this was a Press Preview who knows what more will be in the release. 

Revive did not work out of the box or at all with Stormland. This is expected (based on history) to be fixed by the Revive devs at or right after the launch. Did not get to test Valve Index performance with Stormland.

There has been no real quote from the developer (as yet) on how much playtime is involved. *We finished the* ***PREVIEW*** *story mode provided to us in about 4+ hours but this will most likely change for release. There is a continuing cycle change every week so the game post story mode is different with new missions and objectives. The gameplay duration would then entail one’s own interest in the game itself and multiplayer (coop) gameplay. How much playtime is there in a multiplayer game like Onward VR? Great questions as I am at over 80 hours on that game and don’t plan on stopping anytime soon.*",oculus,Stormland Press Review from EverthingVirtual Show..

I've also been someone who has been wary of joining or supporting Facebook since well before that. I remember being immensely disappointed when Facebook bought the start up company that I and many of you helped kickstart. I did see the obvious benefits of a company like Facebook buying Oculus and I think we've seen VR grow much faster than if they hadn't but at the same time it's becoming harder and harder for my to rationalize supporting Facebook. 

We've seen events like the Cambridge Analytica scandal shake our democracy. Facebook's role in the spread of misinformation in elections around the world. Facebook's recent stance on political ads. Mark Zuckerbergs secret meetings with politicians to help oppose a rival of them and Facebook. The list goes on and on...

I'm not trying to hate on Oculus or anything. Like I said I love my Quest and Rift but it's becoming harder to harder to deal with the contradicting feelings of supporting a technology that I love and supporting a company that I see as a danger to democracy and the future.

I want to be able to play something where im moving through a level with an objective to complete, and preferable not have to rely on the enemy, being actual people.   Pavlov will need to upgrade their Bot AI before thats really feasible for them anyway, but i saw a post that mentions they plan to revamp the AI sometime next year, so fingers crossed.

I prefer pavlov, over onward, but does onward have any kind of mission creator?  or is it all just PVP as well?  From what i understand, Onward is more strategic, but its still just people playing against each other, right? Does it have any kind of missions, or a mission creator?

3. The only good streaming is possible with native player and proper encodings to match maximum specs of each headset 

4. People’s impression of VR video today is some distance from what the hardware can actually deliver because of multiple poor experiences they had in previous years. 

5. WebVR/WebXR is a pretty terrible way to do both browsing the UI and VR video playback, though it has a huge potential to evolve. Oculus Browser and Deo web player (not to confuse with DeoVR native app) are the only good implementations for video. 

6. Lightfields are not really there with the first stills coming in the next 2-3 years.

&gt; Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are ubiquitous because they characterize linear transformations: operations that stretch, squeeze, rotate or otherwise change all parts of an object in the same way. These transformations are represented by rectangular arrays of numbers called matrices. One matrix might rotate an object by 90 degrees; another might flip it upside down and shrink it in half. 

 

&gt;They’d noticed that hard-to-compute terms called “eigenvectors,” describing, in this case, the ways that neutrinos propagate through matter, were equal to combinations of terms called “eigenvalues,” which are far easier to compute. Moreover, they realized that the relationship between eigenvectors and eigenvalues — ubiquitous objects in math, physics and engineering that have been studied since the 18th century — seemed to hold more generally.  
&gt;  
&gt;Although the physicists could hardly believe they’d discovered a new fact about such bedrock math, they couldn’t find the relationship in any books or papers. So they took a chance and contacted Tao, despite a note on his website warning against such entreaties.  
&gt;  
&gt;“To our surprise, he replied in under two hours saying he’d never seen this before,” Parke said. Tao’s reply also included three independent proofs of the identity.

This means i can download around 700kb/s or 2.5gb an hour. This is at max speed where literally nothing else using internet functions so i'd probably cap it slower. When the game first came out and i saw the staggering 130gb filesize i dug in for the long haul and waited. 

Like many others, my download kept failing and making me start over. Since oculus launcher doesnt know how to discover existing progress BEFORE it checks for available space, this meant i had to free up another 130gb of space so that asgards wrath could have the 130gb pre allocated staging folder AND oculus launcher could check for the extra 130gb before it discovered my staging folder and started the download where it left off. The launcher kept choosing the worst times to fail the download when i'd leave the PC on so downloading the original game data took me almost 70 hours. 

now the first patch is out, hooray, and for some reason they made it 130gb, which the launcher checks for space before it can begin. i already had to play tetris with my ssd folders the first time and theres not much free space to be had. between having to do all that again AND the idea of going through another 60+ hours of downloading means i'm likely not even going to patch the game. why cant the launcher discover files in its own staging folder? why cant the game just patch files instead of redownloading literally the entire game? 

this is an even bigger problem for people on metered connections. a lot of caps are 100gb or less per month, that paired with those types of internet also having poor speeds its a double fuck you. i cant check yet but i sincerely hope that i can launch the game without updating it because i feel like i could beat it all quicker than i could download the patch for it",oculus,"Asgards Wrath patch 1 is another 130gb download.

Wow, I thoroughly enjoyed this! I've not been so unnerved/so uncomfortable since I had a Knife shoved in my mouth in Resident Evil 7! Puzzle Games are not my Go to Genre but this Hour Flew by, I was so engrossed! Loved every minute! \*\*Warning, Beginning room Puzzles Spoiled Obviously\*\* 

I did a write up on this game here after I tried the Closed Demo and thought i'd check in with the Full game now that it's fully out and The game has not disappointed so far, the Dark and Creepy tones running through it are even stronger in the final game, I mean I decapitated the poor girl in the first room ffs lol

Theres supposed to be about 15-20 hours of game play if you want to get every single ending in the game and do every variant of rooms, and to be honest I like the way the game is broken up in to a mini room then a main room followed by an ending. The game is essentially offering you multiple chances to say ok just one more puzzle, get to the end and now ill shut the game off and come back and do more rooms later.

It makes playing the game in small chunks very accessible.

The price will most likely put a lot of people off, but I can't wait to play more of it, which is a testament to the setting and how engrossing it is as I'm not a big puzzle game fan.

So a brand new left controller arrived and i hooked it up etc. but now my latest problem is that it keeps losing its tracking on this brand new left controller.

Ive tried changing the lighting in my room, re-syncing the controllers and even tried facing the opposite direction as my right controller never loses tracking, When it loses tracking its normally when the controller is near my waist and sometimes it'll either lose tracking completely or loses location tracking but not the angle im holding it, so itll still spin around etc.  


getting super frustrating at this point as it happens so much to the point where im not even able to play games, only way i can get it to re-track the controller is to hold it up high above my head

I play Pavlov on the Oculus Rift S, not sure how to resolve this issue everywhere I look there is nothing on it, maybe someone here can help me? What happens is the gun will shoot fine for a few seconds may be the first 3-5 bullets and then it sticks inside me straight down, I've restarted multiple times, and replaced batteries, nothing has resolved it, its made playing some games unplayable, this does not happen with all guns mainly the ones I show exception of the SLR. Please see what you guys can come up with, and thank you.

I checked it out last night and it's by far the best VR ""movie"" I've seen yet. It feels like a true evolution of filmmaking and interactivity. The story is great, the performances are great (Jeffry Wright and Noah Schnapp!), the visuals and animation are gorgeous, it's like being IN the movie Coraline. 

The story, adapted from a Neil Gaiman story (who also wrote Coraline and is a national treasure), is that you are an imaginary friend created by a young girl named Lucy and since her family doesn't believe her, she recruits you to investigate the wolves she definitely hears in the walls.  It all lasts somewhere between 30-40 minutes.

This experience does loads of great tricks born from each of the worlds of Filmmaking and VR to such an elegant and artistic combination that to cite specific examples would be to spoil the magic of the experience. Lucy herself is very convincing as a person that's interacting with you, she has a stylistic look but the animation is very lifelike and her eyes look very alive and engaged with you. Don't think that you can sit in a chair and passively watch events unfold, Lucy needs your help even though she doesn't need you to progress the story, you'll be turning, kneeling, manipulating objects and even holding hands. That said, it's not a game, and it's not a movie, it's the future.

Despite my reservations, I gave it a go anyway. Here is my review of the game after having played \~2 hours of it.

**Audio/Voice**

There's not much sound at all in this game, but when there is, you can expect it to be creaking, squeaking, a low grumbling, and other creepy noises you would find from a worn mansion-factory like hybrid. Other than that, the silence also lends itself well to the creepy atmosphere. There's not much in the way of voice acting besides that of the little girl who accompanies you. She speaks a kind of gibberish language that vaguely sounds like Japanese, but really isn't. Overall, sounds reminiscent of PS1/PS2 era Silent Hill/Resident Evil games, which isn't a bad thing.

**Graphics**

This game is dark. Like, really dark. Someone made a comment earlier asking whether it was dark in terms of tone or atmosphere, and I'm here to say it's both. The textures and shadows are so well done, you can't help but feel immersed after taking in the environment. So well done, in fact, that I felt a sense of dread the entire time. You never really get to see things up close and personal, but from a distance, everything looks terrible an worn out, in the best possible way. If you're one for haunted houses, there's a lot to get excited about.

**Story**

From what I've played so far, it's kind of loose. You start off chained to a wheelchair with a strange apparatus on your head, and to top it all off, alittle girl is with you and you're the only one who can get her out of this place. After each puzzle, you'll stand on the edge of a cliff and it'll appear to be the end, but trust me it's not. Somehow, you both will start over in another dark room with another set of puzzles to solve. From what I've played so far, it seems like someone's watching you both through one too many TV screens, but that's about all I know of there being an antagonist. The ""whys"" or ""hows"" aren't entirely relevant. The main thing is the puzzles, so let's talk about that.

**Gameplay**

When you start each round, you'll be greeted with a dark room and a lamp that stands before you. Then, the little girl who you'll attempt to save will turn on the light and she'll push you from room to room as you complete each puzzle. That's not to say that every room will have one, though. Sometimes, rooms will have multiple doors, but all but one of them will be boarded off, forcing you to open the only door available. It's quite curious. In those extra ""pre-puzzle"" rooms, there will usually be objects for the girl to interact with or make gibberish comments about, but that's about it. You'll know when you get to the main puzzle room. The way you solve them is like this:

Because you're chained up, the only way you can interact with anything is through the little girl, whom you will be guiding around the room by using a laser pointer that's apparently mounted to your head. In your right hand will be a remote control to activate the laser pointer for a brief second until it turns off. So, you'll be looking around the room, pointing at objects you want the girl to interact with. To boil it down, much of the puzzle solving in this game revolves around the ""point-and-click"" mechanic.

But what if you accidentally look at the wrong thing? Well, there's a bit of a failsafe. The girl will walk up to the object (Lever, button, door, etc) and will look at you while pointing at it. This is your cue to physically nod your head (yes) or shake your head (no). Once she gets the OK, she'll perform the action you want. I'm not sure how I missed this detail, but when I first started the game, I didn't understand that she wanted confirmation, so I'd repeatedly laser-point at the object to no avail. It was only after watching someone else play the game on Youtube that I found out what I was doing wrong.

There's a wide range of puzzles, and some are certainly more difficult than others. Without spoiling any of the puzzles, I can say that many of them revolve around understanding symbols and patterns, though I'm currently stuck on a puzzle that deals with ratios (I was never good at those).

Depending on how good you are at puzzles, this game will last you either 3.5 hours to maybe double that.

After you complete each puzzle room, you'll know you've beaten a round of the labyrinth when the girl opens a door and reveals a white light. Then, the cycle will repeat. You'll start over in the dark room, and the girl will push you into more rooms.

But what if you don't beat the puzzle?

Well, you die. Both of you, actually. You'll watch the little girl die first, and then you'll die. It's...really dark, and really grim, and may be too much for some. The deaths can be quite brutal, so if you really don't like seeing kids die...well I encourage you to either stay away from this game, or be very, very certain that you've done the puzzle right before pressing that final button. Before you press it, the little girl will point at it and look at you, waiting for your response. To me, she was asking, ""Are you sure about this mister?"" and nodding in response was like, ""....Ugh. I don't know if I did this right but....go on?"" I kind of got this slight sickening feeling in my stomach knowing that I gave her the OK to set things in the room in motion; that I was the one that would potentially kill her for not knowing whether I did the puzzle right.

That being said...did I enjoy my time with Last Labyrinth?

**Fun Factor**

Look, I like myself some puzzles, I do, and as with most puzzles, solving them requires time. And while I was solving the puzzles, I was engaged and also, really, really terrified of screwing up. I was excited to see what creative puzzles the levels of this game had to offer, yet I found the game kind of dragged a little because you had to wait. Unlike other point-and-click games where you get an immediate response, you have to wait for this girl to walk from place to place, sometimes all the way across the room for her to interact with an object. You have to wait for her to walk back to you so she can push you into another room, and then you have to watch a short clip of her pushing you into the other room via security cam footage. Also, when you first find out you done fucked up, you're forced to watch the death sequence. In the following tries, you can skip this, but still. Waiting for the girl to do things, for me, got really tiring. That didn't stop me from liking the game overall, but it's something to take note of.

If you're a patient person, like solving puzzles/escape rooms, enjoy dark and creepy atmospheres, and don't mind a kid dying over and over again, then I think you'll most likely enjoy most of what this game has to offer.

**TL;DR:** I liked it. It was sometimes nerve wracking and exciting, but the game started to drag more and more after each runthrough.

**Is it worth the price?**

I won't get too much into this because, well, it's an endless, subjective argument. But because this is a review I'll give you my opinion:

No, I don't think it's worth the asking price of $39.99, making it one of the most expensive titles in the Oculus store. Like I said, I like myself a good puzzle game, but not a $40 one. If you really boil this game down, it's a 3D ""thriller/horror"" point-and-click puzzle game. Its a well done one no doubt, but I can't in good conscience say that it deserves to be one of the most expensive VR games on the market, outpricing other notable topselling VR titles. I can tell a lot of heart went into this game, so it's sad that I have to tell you to maybe wait for a sale, whenever that will be.",oculus,"My Time with ""Last Labyrinth"" [Review after ~2 hours]",https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/dvjnwl/my_time_with_last_labyrinth_review_after_2_hours/,True,submission
