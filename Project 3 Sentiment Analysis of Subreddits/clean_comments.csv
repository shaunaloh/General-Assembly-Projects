thing pcvr game designed controller mind make sense offer headset controller since basically everyone want headset controller doesnt make much sense sell device without controller would probably allow drop price much anyways real option hope find second hand headset broken controller get steep discount would generally advice window mixed reality headset find controller horrible controlller tracking worse competition although certainly usable since care shouldnt bother cheap wmr headset might best bet although certainly big difference visuals cheapest wmr headset like lenovo explorer expensive one like odyssey plus hp reverb well expensive wmr headset expensive point would get rift better tracking tldr hope cheap used headset get cheap wmr headset ,0

doubt preorders ,1
think vive still solid purchase esp get da original headset reason ,1
pull wallet bam vive index ,1
black friday sale right legit good option ,1
huge grip button trash anything strength training heard endless report broken due part touchpad wearing away htc support useless without valve ,1
rift vive various pro con prefer vive yeh sidestep open door much better hmds vote vive pro brand new pimax tried yet ,1
terrible grip button bad game opt pick thing trigger instead finger tracking sort well technically track thumb trackpad useful analog stick lack button general super bulky never forget holding thing happens often touch index controller ,1
got sim sick first bought vr thought made mistake dropping much money something would make sick every time played even lay several hour particularly bad session however get better regularly sim race vr play game issue never get sick found ease build sim leg start thing cause problem game character move space like beat sabre space pirate trainer sort thing initially use friendlier locomotion alternative eg teleportation respect limit start feeling sick push call quits get faster push feel sicker ,1
depends game pretty bad first feel sick take hour lying get better nowadays fine ,1
seen verified statistic issue like ,1
take slowly stop immediately start feel ill train brain see ok continuing horribly sick make worse counter productive ,1
vice around year never anyone complain motion sickness dad say feel g force rollercoaster simulator ,1
thing notice pretty quick get motion sick start feel uncomfortable take headset stop playing couple minute feeling arrives get long lasting motion sickness also maybe beginning take rest every minute check feeling notice something feel game try limit motion sickness inducing mechanic fine fun playing really something else ,1
lot game made vive controller mind therefore good good complaint read lot start thinking wanted joystick touchpad thought worst controller reputation thing like window mixed reality suppose longer market people grew dislike vive controller seemed weak specific build area known touchpad breakage recently hard replace battery another dislike felt way expensive making painful thing deal lot noise created vive controller seems like alternative usual thing people justifying purchase thing like valve index controller seemed incredibly overhyped especially release ,1
seems almost good true hope get scammed something ,1
probably form vr sickness start likely mild soon sort vr sickness stop playing go people often say ginger beer ale help important try power lot people make mistake definitely regret try people never get vast majority find play session get longer longer longer feel bad first get try cockpit based game first racing flight space sims give fixed viewpoint help minimise sickness build full locomotion fps worst bringing sickness someone else mentioned almost every game come comfort option day default teleport locomotion snap turn vignetting movement help worry soon enough able turn enjoy game however want sickness free ,1
always felt vive better cv think worth buying already cv probably better save index kit vive pro kit want wireless ,1
htc vive pro full kit euro europe yeah want get asap htc cosmos euro fuck would even post ,1
found vive uncomfortable hour base head strap da comfortable use hour people different prefer base strap da really great purchase ,1
worry lot people tried set one ever sick nausea never happens anymore much problem early vr day due poor game design hardware devs idea locomotion also early headset oculus rift dk even full head tracking rotation hz top seemed every time saw demoed roller coaster simulator ,1
stuffing ragdolls locker slow mo gunplay exactly new guy playing look like pretending fun ,1
used motion sickness car younger vive experienced motion sickness playing subnautica little bit difficult navigate ocean using headset especially cord wireless would perfect using p gamepad control camera motion good game fine skyrim fallout beat saber etc ,1
also mostly avoided short min session first taking headset start feel iffy ,1
think anyone world prefers vice control lol ,1
rec room user choose use smooth locomotion bad ,1
agree effective integrated headphone tension knob back like mandatory ,1
game playable og vive playable vive cosmos logically untenable question think already bought game vive already got vive therefore care whether game compatible budget headset already bought game vive reason care game made vive compatible either way way asking question two untenable answer already vive matter whether game work cosmos already got better version cosmos already vive buy vive buy game matter whether game work cosmos already better version cosmos however interested higher resolution display recommend look htc vive pro headset valve index headset ,1
yeah touch pad issue real bummer first thing go stopped syncing light house ended buying second vive setup minus base station cheaper getting couple new controller plus spare lighthouse extra hmd ,1
think excellent intended purpose valve vision always avoid gamey interaction multiple button combination smooth locomotion via gamepad etc viewed context lot design decision make sense grip always meant toggle still think mistake see design make design light trackpad intended multiple us see welcome tutorial valve always assumed teleport way forward due vr sickness might still right yet get beyond niche adoption enthusiast prepared get vr leg might work next million personally speaking like weight especially beat saber done ton public demo assure handing someone gamer never used vr controller requires much le explanation hand rift index window mr controller ,1
worse others prone motion sickness small boat big ship problem vr made bit nauseous first time friend mine tried vr racing sim rig almost instantly felt like going puke never feeling definitely worse others touch pad locomotion type smooth transitional motion like driving make feel weird first guarantee whether feeling ever go away depends person unfortunately like others said get used build tolerance time thing still affect probably go people play inconsistent frame rate sometimes imperceptible brain still somehow still realize somethings right ,1
oooh good deal ,1
agree lot tracking inside never better base station ,1
personally bother cv og vive tracking fov better although screendoor worth better say money go rift vive pro index straight away think end spending long run going step step ,1
different everyone quite lucky never gotten motion sickness boat stuff found bought vive go forever feel anything even walking instead teleporting fine ,1
found running vive r x often running issue usually card started overheat space heater back doubt ram speed issue since running ddr issue likely compatitbily like steamvr graphic card setting ,1
game teleport perfectly fine motion sickness teleport mostly happens smooth motion sensitive like use teleport sometimes get motion sick low frame rate poorly designed game make mistake moving scene around common aaa game never make mistake ,1
motion sickness bumpy car ride zero vr think doctor motion sickness happens eye seeing body follow hence badly done vr game advice get eye measured ipd make sure setting spot take time getting strap adjusted firmly place headset wobble movement super important headset head get vr leg pretty quickly enjoy ,1
paid amount og vive came index much better every regard expensive think worth every cent use daily like ,1
question want better vr rift upgrade maybe save money make obsolete headset controller vive think money saving aspect clear anyway upgrade rift index sell full rift system easier sell probably retain value selling vive headset controller without lighthouse easy ,1
happy take price pm arrange ,1
dead jim ,1
game give motion sickness option creates vignette moving help drastically one game particular give bad motion sickness subnautica dont know generic app download something like game might place start slowly reduce vignette amount til nothing ,1

first played game joystick movement felt like levitating hard explain lmao would get mild headache half hour best thing stop playing feel sick get headache week two went away cruise around stormland age without issue push ,1
rift tracking surely isnt par vive think bit behind tracking capability update firmware improved usability pavlov beatsaber x b im sure par lighthouse nearly bad released ,1
young get motion sickness vr immune motion sickness god ,1
strait defective htc never fixed problem changed em different color kept shipping em one reason never support htc bad business practice ,1
would need paint let ir light pas block tracking ,1
personally spam checking site every minute also followed added wishlist might notification ,1
say get index afford get oculus rift oculus quest link cable original vive tiny bit better original rift opinion htc since left dust valve stopped innovation ,1
http www trustedreviews com news run htc vive gpu nvidia geforce gtx amd radeon r equivalent better cpu intel amd fx equivalent better ram gb video output hdmi displayport newer usb port x usb better port operating system window sp window later window ,1

google earth ,1
specifically asking vive wand bad ,1
unfortunately found thingiverse yet definitely keep looking ,1
people demoed one trouble motion sickness even handle smooth locomotion many title ,1
idea behind wand bad ultimately using touchpad simulate interactivity locomotion subpar compared button thumbstick grip toggle button awful immersion prefer swappable battery last day normal usage compared charging vive wand daily wand anything right first dof market show ,1
thanks check get chance ,1
yeah think exact opposite think vive wand trash vive owner trying justify purchase saying bad absolutely significantly worse ocullus touch controller knuckle immersive well designed literally think one game prefer use really think vive owner trying convince playing gimped experience last two year everyone touch controller experiencing immersion interaction pretty close knuckle although quite level immersion ,1
bad get sweaty beat saber become slippery otherwise think perfectly fine whatever year old vive le first everything come since learned natural new product improved upon old way vive wand really sturdy experience flailing nearly year thing hit thing quite time definitely getting rid index controller arrive controller time changed ,1
work realistically bottom end vr spectrum afford upgrade think go long time ran vive sub par graphic card able lot fun run wall higher end game though flat screen fine play game dip framerate option vr part dip toe vr laptop got start saving upgrade cost effective build desktop purpose need use laptop whatever reason plenty option powerful enough ,1
generally agree think regarded worst controller two factor enthusiast want maximum number control option fingertip build quality crap htc support index set home old vive boxed demo laptop demo vive people take controller intuitively working requires barely explanation say game properly implement knuckle controller finger tracking intuitive vive wand game pretty rare cost technology might keep rare come ,1
space ship pilot design ,1
think sell used index full price still manage afford index everything plan save valve index controller ,1
yeah bad start shy looking ,1
said recording voice youtube purpose want tip toe water recording vr gameplay good microphone voice one want hear mic sound like came ,1
someone mentioned bad performance notice performance issue tracking issue close eye hmd get working sometimes even losing screen cause sick feeling ,1
alright well sound like looking nothing le space engineer vr even ask ,1
mean want fly build depth space building actually saw game look like may according rumor may vr support launch want game space flight building ,1
game like spend buck ,1
yeah hesitant granted could get subnautica work full vr think tided bit want pilot seamoth controller cyclops prawn suit ,1
even controller support give go ,1

fine compare newer controller released since compared controller especially index really bulky awkward feeling use seem clunky place general vr interaction using ergo friendly index controller difference pretty major getting used smaller comfortable index touch controller action like swinging sword nice weighted feeling wand hand everything else another layer abstraction add undesirable separation virtual reality real world ,1
ok bullshit second hand vive apparently stock ,1
happens situation character perspective move physical movement match game problem though ,1
work use natural locomotion two steam controller dongle enables walk place locomotion use phone arm band holder strap around calf also work game actually use leg foot tracking eg blade sorcery ,1
plan work proper usb hub practicality running cable foot extra weight usb hub somewhere ,1
yes already og vive stuff ,1
mexico still found get index stuff someday tho ,1

thanks ,1
thank man hope start playing ,1
sold directly amazon black friday lighting deal expected return easily tho ,1
like never really problem quite sturdy imagine index controller holding well battle versus wall floor ,1
upgrading k new mobo update post upgrade ,1
vive pretty comparable cv think touch controller actually little nicer vive wand tracking vive definitely better already sensor set cv marginally better probably notice difference time consider paying basically side grade sell cv kit amount money maybe worth otherwise valve sell v basestations getting knuckle anyways need old vive wand basically paying headset really different counting fact new basestations arguably better think find kit used ebay craigslist something total probably worth able upgrade easily future hard sell given already cv ,1
yeah agree quest great headset use case cable increase value want best answer still quest freedom give pretty damn awesome like bringing family party instance ,1

update seems disabling virtual desktop service solved although vd start window still seems run service work perfectly excited base station living room index controller ,1
negative review rift usually tracking slightly worse previous rift inside tracking still good worry rift overall seems like better solution vive base station however buying rift would personally wait maybe extra month see quest link cable situation turn unaware quest link cable beta feature allows normally weaker stand alone quest headset connected pc run higher end intensive pcvr game obvious drawback moment including controller latency slight compression around outer fov comment developer hint quest running peak performance final release link cable may able bring near vr experience compared tethered headset meaning quest get full power tethered gaming linked completely portable vr albeit lower quality vr un linked price rift limited pc use however speculation waiting full release feature reveal actually possible course wait wont feel buyer remorse quest turn good sound go rift ,1
bundle vive pro one headset one headset controller one headset controller lighthouse need lighthouse anything work guessing index pricey right ,1
yes considering spent fix computer ,1
case say go keep back side stretch arm keep foot planted use snap smooth turn game find hit something subconsciously remembering curtail reach ,1
similar issue msi gpu card sent back service center replaced new fan cost ,1
mean technically gonna play half life vr anyways saving ,1
right need base station pair passive need communicate computer headset work reason bluetooth firmware update power management ,1
situation upgraded headset controller controller upgrade worth finger tracking grip closing opening hand instead two button squeeze made huge difference game play like think headset worth price love built speaker convenient better sounding expected also great hear someone want attention raise visuals definitely better partly headset able fit head much cleaner vive someone else mentioned careful spec think might experiencing game keeping well used hope help happy upgrading controller sure biggest impact ,1
steamvr work one base station front tracking perfect long occlude view base station playable ,1
okay thank definitely try try clear schedule drive hour get one lol ,1
still tax shipping controller ,1
primarily individual finger tracking ,1
long physically sitting shelf pointing headset update position without needing connected computer station even show online pitool software ,1
gotta say happy cake day ,1
ditto waiting come canada came still fence sitting alyx day one purchase anyway found come copy instant sale ,1
finger tracking implemented skyrim unfortunately joystick movement turning vr like pancake nalo touchpad press defaulted activator way comfortable clicking grip vive wand found hand would cramp hour play index controller rest thumb touchpad good button clicking needed use nalo general movement exploration swap joystick combat ability easily backpedal strafe ,1
make sure use strong filament like petg ab print ,1
printed stuff thingiverse could see local makerspaces printer ,1
base station literally dumbest piece technology amazing powerful thing nothing laser shooter pairing power management need plug lighthouse headset see ,1
yeah beatsaber honestly unplayable using index controller use vive wand ,1
fun make sure lighthouse set used c work b supposedly run hz one base station ,1
beat saber saber mode maybe ,1
could buy sheet velcro cheap cut using foam thing template ,1
simply pointing station general vicinity even need show connected pitool ,1
look voice attack great voice command app trigger keyboard command even different application time bind key start recording set voice trigger voice attack http voiceattack com ,1

index trash think ok fov audio glare horrible constant imersion brake specially dark area also black leveles mushy poor index controller kind great time feel cheap finger stracking annoying latency maby mine something wrong know impossible throw granade always landing beside comfort ok think strapping anything head comfortable personally think worth anybodys time visuals would rather wait something oled sad fact thst though lcd offer great benefit local dimming strapped face total shitshow technology imersion image vise ,1
something else wrong pair base station anything dummy object know else diagnose tell pair base station ,1
true ,1
heck back day oculus dk screen set pretty large usable right config worked ,1

someone owned tell visual fidelity index hand much better experience even difference screen ,1
thunderbolt pcie enclosure active optical cable corning spendy possible need long coax cable mount enclosure wall ,1
rift comparable tech actually better option quest want mainly pcvr screen deceptively good check lens comparison headset someone bought quest came long weird ipd would still suggest either also wtf gaudy awful oculus knockoff controller cosmos went look comparison ugh oh cosmos controller take twice aa rift touch controller either way get eneloop rechargables best ,1
huh certainly interesting idea thanks ,1
coming december th seems game people either think second coming christ tech demo tldr boneworks tech demo second coming christ ,1
hmmm would mean would toss adapter index ever go wireless bummer money smh ,1
think upgradimg rift shit sensor exclusive way overpriced ,1
shape controller shifted weight knuckle saber blade poke top hand instead top vive wand inch make difference weight significant tho wand weight front therefore feel like could swinging long thing ultimately going back wand though think getting used difference worse problem accidentally pressing menu button wand constantly pausing mid swing ,1
contrary hold close center mass hold rather loosely way game degree degree condition satisfied easier shorter time moving controller faster le energy consuming moving whole palm sometimes hand flex wrist far think way movement palm way constrained flexibility movement stick hand knuckle get movement palm strapped ,1
hey relative boomer coming thanksgiving meme aside actually age bracket looking game experience enjoy interested beat saber cousin age well h one uncle huge gun nut game include gorn richie plank experience google earth vr tilt brush anything bite sized appeal got couple idea steam vr home show idea appreciated ,1

disable entering dashboard steam vr setting thus disabling pausing mid swing every time starting beat sabre ,1
made switch well significant thing text readable elite dangerous shooter look ahead zooming sde still became non issue hz great running gtx ti earpads ear sound actually good moment took earpads music game think kid hear shooting noise sleeping next door cash run consider valid upgrade ,1
hijacking thread casual got wmr headset controller acer tracking wise good enough screen door effect attrocious spec much greater resolution wise newer headset experience resolution pixel screen door effect ,1
think game something close climbey vr u mostly yeet ur self forward also love arm swinger mode though tire u ,1
natural locomotion game make skyrim lot le headache inducing ,1
armswinger lot better immersing game albeit mostly panicking running cover slow large swing gracefully glide forward lot small one want go real fast ,1
since got dreaded v headset controller trackpad work one corner armswinger negates easy use definetly devs need implement locomotion technique ,1
dreaded also dysfunctional trackpad mean detect finger ,1
people seem hate call garbage found actually superior index one couple circumstance mostly anything involving vr stock much easier use wand ,1
like option naturally prefer smooth locomotion able aim walk ,1
iirc common method alternative teleport earlier people wanted able move pc controller mention work trying aim bow trying move swinging arm time sword shield trying block move vr need way de couple body movement arm movement allow full use hand yes arm movement wonderful travelling distance running around general moment need one thing hand still move practical slightest running forward handed assault rifle trying shoot accuracy one hand swinging move ,1
currently full kit index wayyy better opinion higher refresh rate make game much smoother pc maintain sde barely even headphone sound way better annoyingly clamping ear lile vive pro also much comfortable overall better though black level simply acceptable get warm awhile reason pro wireless valve release wireless kit index ditch vive pro faster htc denying warranty ,1
aim handed weapon move time ,1
switched vive index still clarity much better screen door used irritate quite lot black level good really bother extreme darkness like skyrim dungeon mod game like elite dangerous barely notice able read text easily much benefit pas think going disappointed ,1
sprint vector best implementation armswinger opinion shame game went largely unnoticed ,1
considering getting index headset elite literally thing play length time vr would consider worthwhile improvement og vive comment improvement sde text readability currently still got ti hoping enough drive without issue ,1
effort ,1
think due game set boundary condition considered released verse gripped finger postionions longer binary like controller finally got around playing arizona sunshine couple day back noticed nearly splay palm open completely thing would longer count held even slight curvature finger would still register gripping object ,1
yeah know index wand j want change ,1
sick ,1
made switch opposite direction index vive pro say one better screen clarity sde opinion love deep black lean towards pro pro lack refresh rate make wireless mindful cord playing active game really add immersion ,1
index wireless reason considering swapping og vive guess go index controller vive battery pack ,1
arm swinger work surprisingly well reducing motion sickness aim time think better alternative measure head bob head sway combine simple button press walk rather complex demo head bob time ago heard since according nimsony head sway work even better especially slow paced walking ,1
occasion play og vive couple hour everyday week helped set vr room work let use room working hour fucking pumped evolution vr think alyx let people software house know market vr game experience money tight right know year zero chance vr headset generation still hyped interest user competition cheaper headset future also know feel one gaming pc friend crazed videogamer group ,1

two word wireless ,1
wait hl alyx headcrabs ,1

feel like biggest benefit index controller seamless integration revive oculus exclusive wand translate well lot free locomotion game heard yet try ,1
vive pro maybe contact valve htc support send explain wait factory reset ,1
could one number thing shock test controller well hand probably disturbed internal connection wire adapter component since micro chip longer socketed soldered directly pad chance circuit board may crack causing intermittent operation way really know disassemble controller perform visual inspection reveal problem accomplish feat skill set tool may able correct anomaly luck communication chip chip socketed need reseated indicated response rarely plus careful going forward highly technical skill tool could damage situation maybe repairable good luck ,1
half life vr built around index controller valve also designed could play without feel wrong ,1

index controller really pricey costing full hmd controller kit think make sense included make purchase controller bit le bitter pill swallow ,1
going build noob toob soon advice length piece pipe controller ,1
keep using vive controller honestly reason buy index controller game using gun stock anyway finger tracking largely irrelevant type game ,1
glad included knuckle controller quite pricey semi regretted buying sweetens deal significantly ,1
seems like crazy amount work would worth effort really hated trackpad seems like enjoy modding bejesus hardware would even graft stick felt natural personally fan trackpad vive simple reason actually easier smoother fine movement rolling thumb instead shifting entire thumb thumbsticks feel little mechanical comparison although benefit fixed axis bumping accidentally probably happen lot trackpad really answer question earnest already know answer suspect worth effort ,1

hmm may right recall talk epic using blob shadow robo recall though maybe specific circumstance sure seen ,1
understand come personal preference picture quality important would discribe difference screen door effect ,1

reading far effortless index due screen door effect still good enough replace screen work ,1
would drop performance anyway x ,1
psvr say hello ,1
index far better cv yes get cv used dirt cheap worth beginning ,1
immersion highly personal understand saying ,1
cv year wondering whether price difference justifiable judging everyone response think ,1
need able rotate though clear disability limit movement ,1
dropped performance r boneworks devs stated ,1
quite subjective imo depends income whatnot way dissuading quality used index would say worth price know get use rarely used cv index suddenly going make love vr ,1

oh wow know interesting x b user see difference black lg c vive pro oled picture black vive pro see nothing pitch black light block nose area perfect remeber oculus rift cv always light leaking ,1
interested curious comparing headset resolution ,1
would recommend buying full index kit simply selling vive whole kit rather getting headset controller sell vive ebay ,1
og wireless still convinced move index lack wireless may end pro index controller combo either way nothing worse reminder surrounding tripping cable also understand whole wireless work great used properly noise th gen run great wireless gtx recently upgraded better mean would break setup take place wireless issue unless running old cpu mile distance wireless sender reciever dont know ,1
got ipd low like could issue lowest ipd standard vive pro like maybe effect centered apparent optical lens frensel ,1
much selling ,1
kinda boat rift dk want upgrade looking everything think going get rift next week black friday sale quest need bit processing power run computer apparently enough run quest rift wireless vr sound great tied oculus store purchasing game sound good especially game want play steam anyway ,1
people say replacing original usb cable battery wireless adapter helped ordered one give try similar situation added fan temperature stay issue cpu gpu load yet still get grey screen fairly often kind restart wireless app fix hear usb device disconnecting reconnecting feel loss tracking issue go away soon reposition ,1
excited play yes seems like glorified tech demo sure full game lot content seems like threw everything knew vr put one game bad def tech demo ,1
correct hell yeah going amazing ,1
let put like skilled game developer could make beatsaber replica prototype literally day minus art ,1
lol stfu ,1
probably able play room scale title ton great seated stationary title play ,1
uhm basically nothing even imagine ,1
would recommend getting controller maybe want future get rest kit sell vive controller real game changing part index unless pc powerful enough higher re higher refresh rate ,1
might need pick vive tracker game ,1
yeah people getting hyped reason deb taking ever finishing game game tech demo game jumbled mess keep adding random feature scream tech demo care much time spent making seem like spent much time game design aspect rather want make feature rich play anyways hype dying need alyx ,1
thank could provide example please ,1
vive work fine linux gotta run game trough proton though ,1
let say room really big ,1
yeah seems case ,1
nothing vive heard manjaro pretty trash better something like archlabs fedora ,1
man sky vox machinae assetto corsa euro truck simulator derail valley name look vr game steam dont room scale icon amend comment say truly room probably worth unless already play think might enjoy title listed ,1
lol fan huge interested trying lipstick battery get grey screen every hour average terrible still pretty frustrating seen guide posted anywhere get set ,1
sure typo wrong measurement space even able use motion controller think might even smaller standard chair ,1
think could play beat saber x standing space like half meter almost direction arm space ,1
thats standing space eould guaranteed hit anything valuable ,1
beat saber might little tight standing stretch arm way side without hitting anything ,1
think cool relic someday nostalgic otherwise good idea offset price also save money getting new station get keep old vive well ,1
yes side ,1
absolutely play beat saber even think play basically gamepad game many vive good choice either ,1
said risk beat saber requires alot movement ,1
stretch arm way ,1
yeah definitely picked index controller use pro say worth issue u seem wireless nothing computer wireless receiver overheats effect entire screen going grey briefly kind like stepping view lighthouse many people solve issue attaching large fan receiver apparently work context spec overclocked k ghz gb ddr ram gtx ti graphic card ,1
stretch arm vr forget space ,1
probably thing really care og vive resolution amazing le pc render regardless thinking getting new inner padding make comfortable controller fine would love finger grip index controller also come hl ,1
go cosmos quest better tracking support game could also go rift pretty solid heard ,1
seems work fine p ,1
love cv like crazy p screen really showing age even compared go quest index screen mile always envious lighthouse tracking ,1
cool may consider getting one take still way get oculus rift working yet ,1

permanently see still able even stretch arm going work space sorry ,1
boat decided upgrade controller index controller im waiting next gen vr headset come enough new spec difference upgrade yet needed controller ,1
going running pc time get rift ,1
someone else mentioned getting original vive would add index controller might good config possible see get vive hmd base station possible deluxe audio strap otherwise rift quest link cable check pc spec budget ,1
game made exclusively duck season ,1
live apartment feel pain wall damage policy stupid tenant go room every year also understandable personally went cheapest solution could set mine read bunch people saying avoid adhesive strip solution mine set year apartment say work long know reason strip get better recommendation community people use wrong inside wall mount hollow strip nothing stick found discarded corrugated plastic sign cut size little bigger wall mount bought nylon screw bolt used attach wall mount piece plastic set velcro strip mount securely wall opted velcro strip could move light house around wanted play driving game wheel le hassle move lb light house rather lb chair cable keyboard mouse attach light house wall monitor reset system seated another benefit velcro strip disposable enough could buy set ever wanted take vive somewhere quickly mount wall without song dance finding something tall enough rest light house hope idea help ,1

u sell locally offerup perfect condition og vive sell usd easily box probably include vive specific accessory personally list higher buyer think would rather save little quest rift however selling headset wand keeping base station think would good idea sell separately usd headset usd controller whatever comfortable range ,1
beat c p wall thing get broken blood ,1

true ,1
pc handle load headset get controller cause afford whole thing rather one feature really interested ,1

latching question new steam client check system index capable running og vive fine want end disappointed getting index find get refresh rate ,1
would give fucking gold kind money ,1
controller worth thinking upgrading bit pricey seen review idk want wait better version ,1
wireless adapter done gearvr mod would say complete upgrade across board og vive bought index ended returning go back wire god ray kinda sucked black level bother image clarity increased fov huge upgrade headphone overall quality feel like massive jump da physically ear much bigger upgrade expected able hear talk clearly much nicer ,1
program steam called ready valve index also jump fidelity amazing even keep hz knock want supersampling ,1
vive us oled index us lcd reason recommend keeping vive getting index controller picture important comparison seen mark http www youtube com watch v sim gfg lp feature share ,1
sell whole vive kit get index kit even wireless go back addition visuals audio comfort much better using index get past heat pressure vive face ,1
upgraded recently able sell vive r hardwareswap ,1
controller great upgraded og vive wand never looked back ,1
smelly zarcha wanted support teleportation stuff inevitable someone chime advice get vr leg sissy three year clear many u never usually complain sliding immersive understand unimmersive teleportation even acceptable developer ignore u place warning steam page teleportation option ready buy espire heard ,1
ebay always worth checking completed sale market value item ,1
bought used vive march came everything plus tripod stand base station carrying case da sold couple week ago ebay kept stand carrying case base station picking index next week wait originally going get controller selling stuff making end coming pocket index hmd controller controller alone paying index hmd amazing deal offload part vive setup like brainer ,1
measure actual space edge help people help likely small room scale many game right e g beat sabre gorn generally anything moving waving arm around needed stationary standing game even nominally roomscale seated one ofc ok long suit staying one place many conversion like e g skyrim serious sam actually stay one place may easy think ,1
someone og vive recently replaces wand knuckle absolutely pull trigger especially depending game play work perfectly base station currently thinking saving hmd play game like blade sorcery social game pavlov hyped bonework hl pull trigger regret ,1
game work worked wand considering upgrading especially come hl ,1
index comfortable hmd ever worn live without ,1
release wireless adapter index ,1
great thank check running gtx ti hoping fine plan adding another expense new processor ,1
vive pro bad horrendously overpriced came mean good good enough warrant crazy price increase re higher rigid head strap besides much upgrade vive ,1
dont recommend index controller poor qc ever trackpad button failure original vive wand index controller joystick common point failure took month use joystick begin drifting ,1
care lot oled color recommend pimax k xr p oled screen super large fov wireless although planned optic quite bit better come rigid headstrap vive da fitted onto adapter pimax drawback though image distortion subjective though amount experience depends person pimax releasing rigid headstrap new foam piece headset heard seem help distortion better positioning headset face ,1
index need lens mod though prefer lens mod adapter touching face closest setting lose fov adapter also regularly remove adapter remove dust screen wireless reason released index eventually ,1
okay running anyways light de ,1
depends like index controller keep vive buy controller headset get one decide money worth ,1
dont think simulated turning lot level design staying one spot occasionally enemy behind think cloudlands mini golf one handed simulated turning ,1
totally agree never go back pro unless index broken could get used pro half price comparison start make sense ,1
moving house recently played vr kept date month new controller big step forward ,1
yes long flail arm around bend pick thing work longer game usually sit swivel chair anyways really move around lot game like budget cut ,1
lol joined reddit day ,1

kind mostly entry level pcvr may struggle newer demanding game likely need reproject frame even lower setting although probably ok older le demanding vr game also going depend hmd buy pick high resolution hmd like index video card important part pc come vr gtx pretty much minimum recommended card og vive rift cv upgrading give better vr experience later ,1
bought valve index already owning original vive tell image definitely sharper make difference look distance enjoy view rather strain eye last able appreciate fully modded skyrim blown away sits le firmly head loosen upper strip lot tighten back kinda make head hurt want sweat decided keep original vive sport game active sweaty one beat saber pistol whip graphic important one knuckle amazing hold controller important also expected able throw thing better still kinda awkward said wave reduced range motion controller movement hand movement controller movement hand movement movement controller hand make difference beat saber overall would say definitely worth playing game feel like getting full experience thought back mind wish pixel ,1
swapping vive vive pro lens gearvr lens get edge edge clarity massively reduce god ray disadvantage increased pupil swim ,1

think different version least generation maybe upgrade internals whatever yeah stay least next year would think ,1
even da comfort always issue vive especially heat hearing index get even hotter reluctant get still pulled trigger hla trailer massive difference actually play hour without even thinking removing headset everything black level upgrade well bother nearly much thought would awesome headset overall ,1
yeah going use justify purchase lol waiting black friday incase extra discount ,1
agreed love flip get small light leak nose ,1
thanks feedback probably right mostly fun actual practicality ,1
used either looked price yesterday index headset almost half price vive pro headset index vive pro madness thought would cost similar amount region bit annoying would choose colour effective resolution think effective resolution make pretty big difference even without extra pixel supersampling make huge difference anyone really justify nearly double price seems like best sidegrade index see people mentioning wireless money still ,1
physically move eye around looking lens different angle position affect distortion basically see like thing expand contract look around engineer lens minimize pupil swim generally come expense problem like increased god ray smaller sweet spot gearvr lens larger sweet spot le god ray le optimal pupil swim trade valve seems believe pupil swim worse aspect often make sick even notice ,1
happy cake day bro ,1
thank replying uh somehow fixed today using vr whole day everything work perfectly sure user could use post case problem ,1
tried vive cosmos luckily returned quickly enough sweet spot annoying get right head sad screen really sharp minimal sde give tracking benefit doubt get better imagine modded optic pretty nice willing go way yeah sweet spot drove crazy htc really dropped ball headset going quest link cable travel sure headset get better update software ,1

probably pulled internal ribbon cable connects tracking sensor controller done three time gorn need take controller apart reconnect ribbon cable click screw back together careful take slow hasty might snap sensor rip cable somewhere watch teardown video try ifixit thick two part ribbon cable image next right index finger http nevzfk ii cloudfront net igi uvvensulnfxlr hd huge http nevzfk ii cloudfront net igi uvvensulnfxlr hd huge ,1
agreed rift cv owner preordered cosmos ,1
comfort resolution fov greatly improved downside oled lcd get dark grey instead black noticeable space game ti fine unless crank setting also steam reprojection smooth rift space warp ,1
rebind using steam input handedness issue ,1
headset also worth strapped cash controller enough keep base station sell vive would probably go max still use vive wand beat saber rare title work knuckle ,1
honestly trieal error idea fixed might something cable ,1
heard wrong ,1
listen using linux year good ,1
really bad main beef wand easy hit one another basically nothing touchpad lot unused space could accomodate extra button spent majority time pavlov moving wand really hate looking back ,1
worth going matter budget put like pc strong enough take advantage hz afford upgrade headset controller together yes worth combination greatly improved resolution seriously almost night day vive increased immersion controller get close hope next generation vr tech believe upgrading controller headseat quite worth though incremental upgrade nice probably something could wait longer together though make great upgrade got money ,1
currently trying gap moment bit odd growing ,1
say vive pro wireless adapter index know going wireless index probably better choice ,1
thin vr cover vive pro fov pretty close index ,1
cool tia sharing ,1
wireless run lower resolution native pro fix ,1
stay connect steam memory vive ,1
yeah really bad strictly speaking guess based people keep saying constant desire thing ,1
kijiji friend plenty seller index chance post wanted ,1
tested wonderfull experience really loved attention detail hidden easter egg lot work passion put really inspired overall historical information vr mechanic vr educational experience give u ,1
add possible association valve whole believe secretly valve game however quite possible crucial test valve going first real vr title fully realized physicality think valve closely attentive reception maybe even incorporating full body physic alyx release depending test think lot learn title given similar feel half life well idea ,1
unlikely index launched two new market canada japan trouble keeping everything except full kit stock much reason discount point ,1
oh know wishful thinking hahah ,1
adjust head strap make shorter ,1
gpus ,1
using delux audio strap elastic thing come vive ,1
finger tracking work fine station vive hmd ,1
functionality present developer finger tracking another story yes everything work og base station hmd ,1
sold lol want bad hla boneworks ,1
god vive pretty awful getting used index black level certainly different near enough overcome difference image quality ,1
great idea basically get everything brand new ,1
almost sorted wall extension cable issue sure figured announce wireless kit make effort obsolete ,1
replacing battery ,1
intent pc another room wireless work anyways vive wireless adapter requires antenna pointed directly play space think able extend coaxial cable long enough another room degrading signal ,1
pc room directly playspace could run cable center room floor joist ceiling mount would fantastic ,1
got battery thing two htc two non htc ,1
delux audio ,1
top loop knob back head ,1
actual playspace x honestly even bother setup going grief worth going end hitting thing good want play seated vr game maybe case bother vive get samsung odyssey lenovo explorer ,1
finger tracking detect gripping ,1
nothing worth able learn ignore even terrifying get floater stuff actual eye affect vision time caused vr saying happen learn ignore ,1
stock cable wireless adapter antenna like foot ,1
hold controller right angle detects finger leveled extension grip button pressure travel cover underside controller place vice grip hutton ,1
wm awesome really nice laptop lightweight help make screen real estate without move hand mouse couple vim pretty awesome code lot never move hand key ,1
described start shortening top loop turn knob back bring close enough face stay put turn head ,1
upgrade hmd great upgrade resolution wise like going sd hd old enough remember transition noticeable fov another upgrade although honest notice horizontal fov much vertical fov huge improvement sound third big change new speaker amazing controller better wand still supported natively many game make little fiddly find right binding overall definitely improvement ,1
ouch would mounted top corner room ,1
find post sum near exact thought much eloquent way gold ,1
would say yet brand new vive feel like huge waste money buy index bought controller headset wait price drop ,1
pause game use shadow play agree tho button map headset ,1
yeah like replacing screenshot button record last second ,1
currently vive setup apartment living room adjacent bedroom pc living room tv two couch vive lighthouse two opposite corner extendable spring loaded pole purchased amazon http www amazon com dp b sy e ref cm sw r cp awdb dbxvj p p adjusted tension tight fit floor th ceiling top pole lighthouse pointing towards middle living room lighthouse mounted onto pole using attachable clamp http www amazon com dp b e aw ref cm sw r cp awdb q db xq tv stable since may year ,1
think given sheer number vive owner pulled trigger index controller alyx trailer would riot black friday deal seems unlikely ,1
losing goggles low re could worth ya ,1
bluetooth turn basestations used imo easier turn manually switch unplug even bluetooth work break almost every patch ,1
yeah likely right maybe discount steam card somewhere something even pay steam balance index item ,1
personally controller worth upgrading headset worth use pimax going vive wand pimax controller big jump game supported ,1
personally would love see valve add locomotion classification steam store show vr spec like tracked motion control standing roomscale etc think would godsend people strong feeling one way another type locomotion enjoy vr ,1
skyrim work little joystick still end teeny touchpad slide movement nalo always thought joystick would solve lot motion sickness ie get sick slide motion b ear take getting used devs never slide movement right make relative center pad instead centering first touch moment thumb land little there deadzone lurch forward back puke city use nalo figure stick way awesome give dragon finger someday ,1
da velcro strap top adjust ,1
unaware story game inside defective o enemy effectively glitch bug encountering supposed look like graphical glitch ,1
answer ref skyrim play joystick help significantly holding controller aligned properly success left locomotion stick turning right hand side get bit much ,1
completely worth difference blow away maybe get much headset standard accessory poked around ebay bit htc selling certified refurbished one ,1
turn touchpad touching imagine thing like pavlov would way way better knuckle wait mine show ,1
much want would included ,1
turn body able wireless glorious keep tellin people og vive fine get fixing ,1
like tabbed mode lot since use application full screen mode discovering really great part like gui configuration bar alternative polybar ,1
ive worked many time og vive vr desktop ,1
one igpu though nvidia driver refuse pas seem enable x screen plug monitor nvidia x driver suck along inability create custom resolution need main monitor reach hz outside fiddling config file two discrete one really help blender ,1
ordered full index kit flip vive someone deserving want play alyx probably see friend acquaintance work want get cdn entire kit happy spend k index associated pc upgrade make sure alyx ready ,1
think worth right even bought pimax sold since vive pro black color look much better wait price drop better tech upgrading og vive would say vive pro worth get le controller worth though ,1
paid mine wait worth every penny ,1
trying turn trying get damn thing pair first place ,1
every game work lot game optimized take advantage finger tracking though ,1
swapping lens gearvr lens people like lose magic depth perception entire point vr ,1
refunded index pro lens mod much better visual experience skyrim night walk sim night racing ruined index least anyway used oled ,1
yeah definitely bad look video big difference comparing vive pro deal breaker ,1
v og vive yeah index clear winner pay full price lcd upgrade ,1
got game launch grip button got super used update changed button able download alternate build grip button rebound yeah setting pavlov dumb ,1
imagine alternate ending every time different extra deleted scene throughout time watched ,1
anyone know black friday deal buy ,1
hey use unity index controller trigger motion controller grip event know gripping different index controller ,1
precise intel core updated driver today trying fix strangest thing used pc vive year feeling software issue ,1
looking bottom pic un peal bottom till half way round curve replace simply velcro foam slightly way round also sure imagination top image left h side higher right found easiest way find top middle face cover fold half needed press center top adjust rest slightly suit corner face pad digging nose get end ,1
gotten chance watch video yet sound like something like vr garry mod would possible ,1
idea occlusion wearing index controller cause tracking issue leap motion one entertaining thing full hand tracking make intricate rude gesture card humanity game ,1
totally move index controller able let go an relax hand luxary finger force tracking quite sweet aswell ,1

seriously doubt linkbox would cause tracking instability however simple test rule plug usb hdmi part cable directly pc thus using linkbox power also tried use sync cable properly switch base station b mode instead b c typically gray flash caused something play space reflecting base station mirror window shiny surface might want cover also could usb issue try using different port pc usb usb controller known finicky sometimes ,1
wondering maybe game worked different team robin want say next pitching finishing thing tell maybe two game work shelved hope robin speaking hla team game still way optimistic like far know officially walked back full game statement maybe someone ask gabe ,1

nice treat someone ,1

get pimax kx ,1
hmm really depends game work pretty well virtual desktop full roomscale others stuttery mess skyrim vr example work pretty well even roomscale hoping serious technomagic either oculus u ggodin implement kind positional spacewarp quest make roomscale movement fluent stationary seated experience already work pretty well one thing clear though going hard going back tether experience tether free lambda vr port half life quest ,1
cinematic vr mode ,1
say entitled kid think know vr game sorry tech demo enough count vr game ,1
people find extremely hard get motion sick anymore due playing vr long time definitely like kind regret never motion sick first started using vr could lose balance ground suddenly shifted back vr insanely immersive felt real bunch experience resist feeling losing balance reaffirm moving immersion destroyed increasingly felt like screen strapped face yeah think valve right idea create experience cause people become calloused vr like ,1
since garry mod started mod base game say something come couple day game released ,1
two memory got vr leg first playing think drive club psvr crashing instantly took headset layed passed think similar saying playing windlands feeling pit stomach jumped high place hit floor disagree getting vr leg bad thing though allows thing never could time go tech improves change software visually hardware like headset screen haptics get feeling immersion feel sick ,1
strap pc back thing needed extension cord buttload ducktape ,1
yeah couple time early using psvr playing really intense game felt sick better tech experience really help plus think mentally accepting going ,1
really continued producing reduced price probably lowest could go turning profit basestations photodiodes expensive ,1
think main thing groundbreaking time nowadays often better game field valve game often age quite well though broke new ground take company catch often hold ground year still okay age even modern player usually much different current game ,1
would either make big part game multiplayer would take away singleplayer element much add small multiplayer mode would probably die quickly since much focus probably best focus singleplayer ,1
there real shortage affordable used gear market pickup contemplating move higher spec unit certainly atm buying would probably quest thats compelling stand alone play link play pc decent inside tracking better screen rift cosmos could something special launched decent tracking least support og lighthouse built half price without base station much cheaper produce og vive thats reflected price currently ,1
never said releasing sdk would huge announcement waiting source year announce ,1
faced choice op went vive pro wireless already experienced wireless og vive really going back tried valve offered wireless option adapter index stand got wireless vive pro get knuckle christmas ,1
sadly never able work use advanced setting turn mic wanna heard ,1
lab basically hour experience really crazy release big technology hope people make game get people buy willing bet selling vive loss profiting game sale like console would made vr much bigger today ,1
experience ,1
thankfully offer includes getting controller alone aswell ,1
already confirmed aaa vr game back ,1
could actually sell vive pro reasonable price vive pro oled resolution oculus quest stand alone headset come better controller hardware rendering game board justification sell price ,1

oh one thing forgot mention reflective object sunlight mess lighthouse make sure nothing reflective lighthouse see get direct sunlight ,1
single stick memory offer terrible performance even consider ,1
yes release game year zero ba alyx aa alyx ,1
fuck valve ,1
hope valve eventually also release half life vr game vr system like void give player backpack computer let run around unlimited redirecting walkling walk straight game real life actually walking circle ,1
team fortress vr original team fortress also started mod ,1

remember year ago gen vive announced well release speculation new half life coming vr game see vive like huh nice thought cautiously optimistic bit skeptical happen vive became dude gonna still vive gen wanna iron kink polished offering game come point reaction give dude nice thought obviously happening guess lot crow eat tastier ,1
incredibly smart marketing holding index seemed like meaningful step vive waiting content really make must vr upgrade listed vive sale soon saw announcement ,1
tpcast wireless adapter suck extremely unreliable ,1

discount price free game getting ,1
discount free game ,1
happy bought valve index controller launch ,1
tf ,1
yea save game ,1
mean fucking tell controller alone ,1
oh ,1
look like wave shooter minimal forced movement trailer ,1
woah mine day one sooooo one care guy ,1
please google search dumb fucking question known since development started ,1
google cardboard sense corrugation try deceive ,1
dumbass ,1
never played hl get fuck outta kid ,1
go read berenstain bear book child ready ,1
uhhh took nearly decade black mesa released without xen calm dipshit ,1
yes ,1
buy controller without index headset work standard vive probably going standard controller dying way giving htc au two controller especially keep failing ,1
work best bet look someone selling offerup letgo contacting renting ,1
viveog vivepro vive cosmos vive og pro use camera made valve valve index similar oculus rift og track hmd controller vive cosmos built camera like window mixed reality rift tracking good vives wmr rift htc release faceplate vive cosmos use vives camera use flawless tracking software require pc vr ready enjoy steamvr oculus content revive plugin viveport store infinity ,1
holy shit awesome ,1
yeah handful non vr title play anymore choice matter ,1
curious game play better vr ,1
one viable setup vive cosmos hoping get tracking fixed ,1
completely agree nbsp actually wait little longer hl vr mod ,1
giant fan necessity ,1
great news thanks mate got vive like week found first kid vr journey take bit back seat haha nothing wrong og vive good thing cn grab controller chance would buying whole new set right ,1
yeah cool thanks man computer without dial growing played discount console game time built decent pc hl decade old focus sorry trying experience missed ,1
controller alone possibly maybe lighthouse ,1
atm witcher smash bros prefer sit play sometimes fully immersed able pause something else want time ,1
congratulation impending family bachelor child year old play computer game till often without worry adult responsibility really say good thing least child care old hold controller suspect find vr month died man conversation went dark fast ,1
yes annoyed going lose sleep though ,1
thanks tought thing ,1
work well many game physic interaction arm like arm also notice many time correspond real arm fine graphical thing going interacting environment rather ,1
hope also release non vr source game love vr surely play half life alyx really wish universal moddable src game build upon ,1
idk people complaining never get finished http www giantbomb com half life forum half life still worth getting believe see ,1
lot work little effect almost gimmick ,1
would rather arm janky inverse kinematics take lot work get right ,1
headset number growing eventually steamvr game work headset number headset grow oculus tactic going need change ,1
took probably good hour get thru hlvr dk ,1
matter end day selling game focus providing one platform offer game run vr hardware become powerful thing time new headset released whereas oculus tactic become weaker eventually believe going change tactic amount hardware market becomes overwhelming ,1
could wrong guessing main reason want wave youtube video people fondling alyx sure could pulled amazing ik sure want first flagship game even hint controversial ,1
essential recommend playing blue shift establishes backstory character half life also quite short around hour finish afternoon opposing force fun really relate half life safely skip ,1
believe vr service work cloud currently headset currently except quest require connected powerful pc close proximity quest computes everything headset reduced fidelity thus requires cable also think number wrong tpcast supposedly introduces latency sub m htc wireless adapter apparently introduces sub m latency wired latency le depending frequency want whole vr experience running gonna need overall round trip sub m fps m fps m want run fps throw round trip includes sensor detecting computing controller headset pose sending data pc processing rendering game sending response image headset g impressive almost guarentee advertised sub m latency calculated optimally located device g tower however many factor push away advertised latency e g network routing signal strength network load distance travel etc end day g fast way connect phone wired network wired network still much faster g achieve cloud computed vr completely wired solution hope completely wireless one ,1
nah rather arm janky ik predicted one never place real one even valve said rather arm place since found hand alone brought better presence result hand arm flopping around ik model thats reason find valve made vr content arm ,1
time buy vr ,1
tfa ,1
comment aged terribly ,1
nice probably pick controller close game release ,1
oh strap controller notice hand reversed actually cool ,1
best vr controller anyway ,1
prefer floating hand wish irl ,1
used play editor quite bit stupid thing like making button spawned enemy button near spawned health ammo mucking around cant wait able fire jump vr version sandbox ,1
play lot factorio there way would translat eot vr even version like satisfactory dont work well enjoy logistics puzzle ,1
actually sell oculus short entrant race one bringing quality vr good price buy rift shortly upgrade vive quite bring spend au would cost get index even though would like au rift good step oculus good store game building going disappear scene suspect even surprise work ,1
actual embodiment sounding collective intellect ,1
ever seen movie mad max ,1
people buy fukken airpods lose one second month half life price knuckle cutting edge tech real competition add fair priced ,1
bug mabey chaperone wall take second ,1
offense waste time typing long response familiar talking least google stuff quest virtual desktop shadow streaming etc ,1
okay thank order quest ,1
hl put story line fps genre originated doom wolfenstein revolution ,1
vr monopolised facebook practice restricting software hardware valve approach allowing headset run software much healthier vr long run realise casual user probably care great facebook great vr ,1
index controller got basically right index vr kit includes controller quite right though come pair rather single controller ,1
yeah curved portion go around knuckle opposite side opposite hand really possible get swapped around ,1
decade shit ,1
u mean hl ,1
knuckle combined htc vive really worth mean demo look great people actually playing told setup ,1
want index v thats higher re wireless japan working one suck dick going wait forever never purchased anything perfect never buy anything ,1
add mod support also evergreen title like half life live active relevant forever surprised sink hour longer title like asgard wrath ,1
r video r philosophy ,1
guess compare like resolution picture quality cosmos win higher resolution screen door effect cost vive much cheaper longer produced tracking vive much better cosmos using light house system play pure darkness using htc vive ease setup cosmos easier need setup lighthouse comfort subjective upgrade path vive win let say u u use vive pro index controller lighthouse come original vive recommend cosmos sim racing flight game tracking important u need high resolution screen see read text better ,1
like either least hand used floating gun ,1
maybe running oculus game ,1
tried concern trying really see difference kind guy watch movie fps ,1
look awesome want play gordon freeman ,1
period mate ,1
remindme year ,1
jermaine gottit ,1
vive discontinued outdated buy unless find one cheap vive cosmos overpriced disaster launch might get better might case definitely would buy vive pro product vive family recommended want wireless expensive probably consider headset ,1
dont think understood comment think clear understanding involved technical level headset currently capable like energy optimism ,1
sound cool visit museum vr audioguide prefer something strap ar becomes good enough ,1
free index controller headset library yet though ,1
controller alone well get game controller alone ,1
half ,1
using index controller vive headset basestations month issue pair like vive controller switch controller time development reason steamvr automatically recognizes ever set work ,1
nope track show hate reverse kinematics body part vr never match real body part instant immersion killer ,1
thanks reply thought ,1
ok experienced headset receiving streamed image m latency ,1
could like price ,1
steam store ,1
available country ,1
relative sweden think could go border sent local swedish pickup point ,1
know swede dane finn index shipping eu country far efta eea orbit missing ,1
really ,1
ya think didnt think theyve developing modern vr technology like year yea think tried turned fit vision game scrapped ,1
cant find finn ever start shipping norway never heard dane cheak ,1
spent quite lot time working un distort lens see see fresnel lens used main advantage much forgiving location wear headset shape face position eye etc consistent distortion across course side small sweetspot lack clarity light refraction fresnel groove making mainstream headset tradeoff better majority v customer spewing distortion effect lens like gear vr lens much clearer getting exact headset placement within couple mm fairly critical get pleasant result also seems nigh impossible get rid barrel distortion pupillary swim across entire lens barrel distortion keep straight line straight curved also curve move change angle straight line move entirety lens pupillary swim area image stretching compressing place supposed overall seems better experience eliminate swim distortion long bit image seem end brain expects float seems ok sometimes thing bit curved placement sensitive one result may indeed seem brain also working much harder reassemble image fed quickly get eye fatigue experience nausea course seem run limit brain eye face highly critical point game troubling effect noticeable unless really go way look say maybe yet someone better understanding calibration system may able better job yet ,1
entirely wrong oculus work steamvr many vr game steam native support well ,1
meant finish person danish person swedish person indication valve norway iceland switzerland lichtenstein get index anytime soon ,1
oh tought used market something see one people saying working http www reddit com r valveindex comment c spdx shipping au esbx hc http www reddit com r valveindex comment c spdx shipping au esbx hc idk ,1
totally wrong apology ,1
tbh hard even remember game arm like onward arm kind thing notice forget ,1
worry want index somehow ,1
noticed pack game hardware great full price game decent chunk saving ,1
correct read page wrong excellent ,1
technically index controller compatible steamvr game programmer either use steam input api update gameplay issue come love index controller gone back vive wand since got downside known hardware defect valve repair replace take time ,1
really fair comparison use wireless headphone hour every day good pair higher priority ,1
tried try let know great work think harder real life wondered needed improve physic setting shooting ball little easier would pretty fun work well ,1
sound good ai teammate might super smart first least would little like real life pickup game ,1
well first issue vive htc index valve valve index controller available exclusively steam store http store steampowered com app valve index controller get second hand site like ebay get new anywhere else ,1
great game suggestion freekicks penalty challenge reasonable thing make posted much start posting reddit id twitter good ericodev ,1
problem soccer vr headset break thing help wear shoe kick near edge playspace ,1
valve said might miss interaction game without knuckle part pretty similiar controller ,1
understand people enjoy war dust eh ,1
tell buy steam business know tax ,1
completely different though would like watching movie first time deciding never read book seems silly ,1
might better question steam support know hella easy anyone one country ship buy individual company offer could buy individual reimbursed one purchase method company work offer long still company approved purchase ,1
yes start following thanks wait see go ,1
probably much right kinda sceptical custom song becoming big thing game making would complex ,1
much controller ,1
oh sound like number one steam workshop mod already ,1
oculus shit ,1
must fun party ,1
order searched website internet last night couldnt find anything ,1
tbh slowly grown kinda hate time problem thumb stick developing rd dead zone second time jump rma hoop thats top fact awkwardly shaped bottom hand palm getting squeezed much develop callous top hand floating free wiggle around really mess aim coordination nearly perfect embodiment second system syndrome ,1
index controller better weight balanced vive wand much comfortable finger tracking support kinda fun show rude gesture online game people cant knuckle strap allow let go controller grab thing almost like real life throwing thing also fun feel natural really benefit overall immersion sold vive pro controller got index knuckle regret nothing better try somewhere possible buy look like index controller bit fragile comparison vive wand also replace single one index controller yet sold pair thubmstick issue look like valve fixed new batch ,1
controller cool headset upgrade vive index made much bigger difference controller better change much imagined head biggest improvement vastly improved grip sensor great depends advise trying hit upgrade hmd first personally ,1
bought used likely year ,1
considering playing alyx put skinny arm think would immersion breaking would nice option could try see might well option ,1
imagine new star war game first person vr level exploration ,1
either get lapped sit unnoticed couple vr game code anyone interested gap code prevent bot alphanumeric end inserted star trek bridgecrew dy ly q tango yankee romeo rockband vr pnwr w gee mkw ath ye hotel kilo ,1
hope going age well neither halflife game aged well think many game copied hl finally playing felt like already played tldr hope future game copy hl ,1
fantastic piece tech downside find sword game strapped hand cannot angle sword hand otherwise game support awesome ,1
holy shit fuck blood bath behind lmfao ,1
best pack game time ,1
sound like would love programing scripting ,1
exactly subjective people like different shit ,1
tfvrmf ,1
indeed ,1
thanks bud meaning try bridgecrew interested rockband leave one someone else ,1

never late pick hobby ,1
got stoked especially like quality life improvement title played via revive ,1
tax u ,1
ordered mine steam ,1
available australia ,1
tbd ,1
took getting used really like month seen none hardware issue yet fitting hand strap little weird want use top adjustment get angle hand right tightness lot loser first expected stick hand quite well minimal fuss hand seem average large small differently shaped hand may fit well older game work well angle controller hand beat saber biggest offender work feel saber like wand game need little work remap control something make sense skyrim vr default control completely unplayable finger tracking still kind gimmick fairly accurate especially compared oculous squeeze grab thing feel natural get pressure set right angle shooting game good long top hand strap right position ,1
cool ,1
yes ,1
well fair game yet still time put indefinite valve time ,1
wait fuck north freezing as waiting index holy fuck ordering thanks ,1
oof really want keep seeing theae post drift ugh ,1
indicies ,1
highly doubt vr mod top original since made play dark room loud headphone imo second one far better first biased since started really want try vr might worth looking http www reddit com r vive comment dl ha half life half life source vr motion utm source share utm medium web x http www reddit com r vive comment dl ha half life half life source vr motion utm source share utm medium web x ,1
fuckin yup ,1
yea telling lot ,1
half life episode ,1
first wave buyer ragrets far comfortable wand much better button placement touch pad wand fucking joke compared thumbsticks movement well good thing wand turn tracker buy index controller ,1
woosh ,1
care let em fun ,1
yea really surprised lack outcry remember long period arm big sticking point vr sub since hl getting pas saying arm make break prefer hate little surprising see turn opinion ,1
project discontinued long time ,1
tripod take barely floor space take square foot much recommend ,1
keep talking nobody explodes work ,1
new getting sale anytime soon especially announcement getting game free buy ,1
got today problem issue retrain self lol cramp finger finally flick people ,1
agree cosmos bad battery really wish option get vive controller super convenient two set steam controller charge one pack using swap much important vr plug controller playing ,1
highly individual people love hate ,1
able flip combine practically unplayable ,1
exactly thought ,1
would say vive wand fit lot better ,1
think read comment correctly think short long played mostly orbusvr hour b hour hour feel short guess see ,1
freality ,1
cool tech barely anything take advantage ,1
think worth bring immersion issue game natively designed work surprisingly well case emulate oculus touch controller oculus game via revive future bright boneworks alyx set take full advantage month ahead ,1
yes amazing ,1
damn kind ,1
vive must ,1
usually notice bad reason ik screw even game ik solid body never right place match mine find vr body much distracting immersive ,1
started playing half life month ago heard announcement went bought half life still look decent definitely dated graphic gameplay good heard story line totally worth long mind old graphic good buy also steam sale right obvious reason ,1
releasing engine gabe say would three vr title likely get wish ,1
basic concept though aim swinging act button press real problem imho come need move position keeping arm still shooting ,1
went hour trying fix turned usb headset wrong port make sure middle usb port one right probably helpful case ,1
sure may want get stuff mass would expect type sale either entire unit knuckle point though ,1
coming rift cv owner worth upgrade basically go k unit lighthouse etc rift def could use improvement fidelity sde dunno jump index would earth shattering warrant double price ,1
apple ,1
printed couple http www thingiverse com thing use command strip damage wall lighthouse slide put layer fuzzy side velcro back lighthouse mount plate fit holder bit snugly ,1
personally thought worth part probably favorite game physic based also depends much willing spend ,1
played hl like year ago blast mileage may vary ,1
could sworn took longer howlongtobeat say hour main story might remembering incorrectly ,1
http www reddit com r askreddit comment c iizj ,1
actualy beaten phone control sucked mile better recent mobile game would rate ganes following hl annoying level desing lot backtracking hl pretty good get bland generic hl ep kinda dissapointing short hl ep much compelling previus game game attention whole duration ,1
oh jeez still argument year end day want best headset best price really care sure would like software run headset fanatical ,1
dont forget boneworks december th get january maybe month away ,1
understand use steam controller dongle place tried yet cant help much alt see get one htc support gl though ,1
knuckle controller amazing primarily let go grab something else actually let go may sound silly difference really improves thing ,1
mostly love depending shape size hand incredibly comfortable way strapped onto hand hold without holding big step forward vr controller finger tracking gimmick best far reliable even close precise enough add much immersion specifically feel like wow moved finger real life finger game moved similar way opposed wow finger game fun useless pretty much use reliable enough gameplay precise enough emersion ,1
trying figure use vive controller tracker ,1
half life pre sequel ,1
saying angle sword protrudes hand seems like issue could easily solved software way pistol whip spt gun angle slider noticed issue vanishing realm sword game played recently clear would different vive wand matter game angling support vive wand updating index controller ,1
really depends upon k hard say major upgrade vive visually sde effectively disappeared resolution went good enough still enjoy game vive good enough really care anymore still room improve course sound massive jump feel like unfair advantage pavlov tell exactly oclock whatever feel real without anything touching ear field view growth massive enough finally dispel last feeling tunnel vision ,1
actually said day ago level finally finished fixing crash performance issue realese beta steam level already playble steam beta ,1
game like pavlov onward constantly plenty full lobby bet valve made shooter would enjoy success ,1
thanks link try check ,1
think biased vr one area life really spend money cool ness able let go alone pretty huge finger tracking think little oversold point reality game yet using hugely substantive way think game near future also avoid due wanting segment market sure game look cool think anything experience made cloudhead specifically controller moondust creating actual feature specifically controller joystick nice addition people like sliding locomotion trackpad still kinda hard really oversell difference able let go make mentally though even apart obvious difference throwing thing instance really pretty game changing dynamic unlike magic leap instance still getting haptic feedback physical object grab grab thing favorite example holding bolt action rifle one hand go butt muzzle sure part called outer edge rifle stabalize need reload naturally let go butt right hand grab bolt pull back grab bullet put push bolt back grab butt feel like vive controller would cumbersome hell try process one thing would say controller remapping thing like steam controller one really sweet use index controller right grip pavlov bound dropping clip left grip bound hitting slide lock grip also bound hold thing lower pressure value mean keep holding gun drop clip let go gun left hand grab clip toss grab gun stablize automatically hit slide lock ready fire would imagine like pretty much everything valve make go sale point given much hl push hardware sale expect happen point near future ,1
mean sword always one position move inside palm hand strapped hand tight wand move inside palm freely ,1
hm look like much larger footprint product page photo seen bad thought would still mean one lighthouse would play area though deal ,1
oh look good thanks ,1
steam controller remapping function rather robust fiddle get want instance map grip capsense directly make force aware actually grip controller activate make world difference ,1
see exact quality wireless wired notice blur wireless experiencing wireless issue wired using graphic card likely caused something gpu ,1
remove pulsating blurrynedd disabling smooth motion gpu would help yes wireless wouldnt matter much ,1
would say worth enough game fully support game like boneworks half life coming time soon ,1
big issue noticed loss quality due cpu power enough wireless use upto cpu getting bottleneck say byebye frame well ,1
get vive pro wireless single greatest vr feature black level color matter much yeah vive pro brainier get index controller best possible experience ,1
huh holding controller lower vive wand mean turning vive wand sideways something make impossible hit trigger touchpad either way ,1
width foot tripod adjustable keep narrowest adjustment actually le sqft good idea give little extra room estimating thing mine next couch shelf intrude play space ,1
see make gif get home ,1
maybe u kevv help lol ,1
thanks dorito troll dorito stand fella lady ,1
yeeted vive wand drywall still work ,1
offer counter opinion think wireless important enough go index think wider fov important factor black level big problem people make ,1
buyer ragrets far comfortable wand much better button placement touch pad wand fucking joke compared thumbsticks movement well good thing wand turn tracker buy index controller thinking getting index controller replace wand haptic went one wand thats fun beat saber thinking selling ebay put money towards index controller concern reason would need wand replace think reason ,1
sorry argument supposed become invalid certain amount time something ,1
yeah like see half life take advantage switching imagine though tech got motivation support controller offer ,1
yeah vive controller nearly indestructible index controller seem le robust wand weak flimsy index controller still rather sturdy expect punch hole drywall ,1
game today use full advantage ,1
honestly able let go controller add ton immersion throwing thing like nades feel really really natural much even think throw also able open hand grab pick something immersive like gun floor pavlov ammo shelf arizona sunshine agree actual analog finger tracking underused entire tech controller easily used implemented lot game ,1
still wand reason use tracker b kid seem prefer wand small child index controller difficult use small hand c case index controller rma still play wait rma process complete ,1
get swedish danish person help ,1
really gone way search example nothing conspicuously come mind someone might know though case revive stuff made huge difference asgard wrath vader immortal journey god robo recall definitely benefit comfort form factor never fan vive wand ,1
know link username first last character use escape markdown u kevv ,1
ah ok many thanks ,1
many episode total waiting released diving ,1
wish could get knuckle rift wish cheaper alternative index buy ,1
game support think probably order set vive available canada boneworks coming ,1
well boneworks coming th someone like game like pavlov blade sorcery occasional vrchat simply much better knuckle ,1
last one ,1
imho yes ,1
might get see work could put one sofa top sub possibly wide almost exactly deep might work thanks ,1
opinion lcd offer universal improvement oled current vr headset sure scenario like horror game space exploration oled big advantage however due difference subpixel arrangement lcd display look sharp le screen door effect noticeable scenario hmds total number pixel index larger fov mean pixel spread apart report confirm perceived clarity headset index noticeably improved fov without compromising clarity ,1
every game need infinitely replayable cant enjoy game finish move life thing love great movie fact end doesnt make worse ,1
assume mean example rotate hilt hand hold blade extruding pinky side palm ,1
saying initial position wrong saying adjust position mean moving entire hand wand let shift sword orientation hand like real sword ,1
ah ninja style make sense though would mean hit touchpad button guess could look cool second fling back way yep sold absolutely mean fair criticism ,1
really lack cutscenes le interruption gameplay ,1
yep u blindmikey beat minute two get ,1
think half life overrated like rest valve game get wrong good however groundbreaking fashion ,1
use vorpx best thing ever deep regular game stereoscopic without gimmicky control ,1
controller expensive could always resell old controller addition game make tempting game original vive wand sound much tempting cheapest sold ebay ,1
arm swinging seem get way guy http youtu j mge g mra ,1

seems alyx heavily showcase full extent new index controller well release kind developer goody modding game giving developer depth demo index controller likely lead retrofitting index control existing content lead new content supporting box integrated way short yeah think index controller probably worthwhile upgrade right going get part index platform ,1
get alyx free owning ,1

yep maybe consider index obscenely priced release adapter right wire deal breaker ,1
side note emulate oculus controller quite well planning ever using revive anything ,1
honest used major controller index controller still best far even game take direct advantage feature ,1
oh recognized voice ,1
going make many people sick great c bad enough constant speed camera movement dof imagine nausea moving dof action movie induce ,1
flat screen gaming going anywhere valve latest entry vr exclusive might lead significant adoption tech player base instead player base might lead kind adoption potential sale number developer chance making vr exclusive compatible game help make rolling snowball bit bigger maybe show sign slowing time around ,1
maybe minute stomach endurance run ,1
seeing new controller replacement hardware issue hearing probably corrected production issue controller point ,1
people still issue saw one redditor th rma yesterday ,1
help vr arcade town time time close friend one run actually little rollcage esque thing attach controller give rigidity ring top controller well act bumper outside sure name seen accident happen sure helped prolong life controller ,1

hey everyone looking insight possible play together friend vive oculus ,1
congrats ,1
hey thanks need said ordered one right ,1
get headset without vive controller cheaper get index controller plus wireless adapter audio strap close ready player one get ,1
must admit saw finger tracker soon released showing serious lag movement could see vr guessing questioning longer issue ,1
nd hand vive base station ebay knuckle option whether financially worth really depends luck work perfectly ,1
want spend money upgrading index vive make sense anymore especially gpu weak really use index anyway say main option samsung odyssey oculus rift oculus quest ,1
litterally downside experienced controller relearn saber angle beat saber even better great game like pavlov ,1

right chet thinking sand even work valve anymore bad http www geek com game valve confirms half life virtual reality game ,1
use vive wand gorn way hell risking new index controller ,1
although samsung odyssey oculus rift sound awesome requirement window im still stitting old win oculus quest game library seems quite small ,1
really saying want upgrade win year old support end january quest connect pc usb cable ,1
quick google search show issue slight updated existence exact finger tracking still fairly irrelevant button press lag ,1
finger tracking longer lag good hear ,1
kind game application tracker good ,1
could beat room playing ,1
wand taken pretty big beating definitely reality drywall experience take one apart reconnect ribbon cable really simple otherwise beast dropped index wand waist height onto hard flooring stopped tracking rma quick painless yeah maybe vive wand indestructible probably harder break knuckle probably mostly knuckle insane number component inside tracking like far usability go really strong opinion one still hope change software start using finger tracking ,1
awesome thanks quick reply ,1
best exhibit show dope new controller superhot vr hated throwing thing game vive wand awkward fuck press grip button correct moment index controller took little feeling throwing motion touch grip substantially immersive ,1
onward peak playerbase player pavlov player really small number even valve higher still low decent player base glad focusing good singleplayer experience compromising tacked multiplayer part ,1
poor contrast grey black borderline dealbreaker think blown way proportion index value headset controller would take headset market heartbeat ,1
controller since v instance drift technically thumbstick click issue seems le problem controller since might hear feel click action still executed game seems vary person person shame people rma couple time never really ,1
short many pavlov lab superhot h vr come mind top head tried personally would imagine gallery game due developer making knuckle tech demo arizona sunshine kinda really badly implemented several way say lot game work issue really reason pistol whip come mind ,1
hmm game use full finger tracking interesting ,1
think finger tracking point spot incredibly new set tool people use working unity make use finger tracking like miniature menu appear look arm like checking time watch using finger pinching movement select drag drop item api access finger position value matter using refining accuracy ,1
play beat saber strap hand controller hold around degree rotation compared normally held helped sword feel lot ,1
short list game small finger tracking tech pretty new messing api information individual finger position value big feature think people notice knuckle benefit vive wand strapped hand minor huge difference actively hold vive wand like tv remote le hand arm fatigue long play session make strap tight keep loose firm lighter smaller tracking bar sometimes get way thing rarely careful beat saber thumbsticks vr game support feature finger tracking thumbsticks nice feature movement le awkward since bound stupid trackpad natural grip control grip button vive wand fucking suck especially like rubber sleeve protect nick scratch knuckle grip button sensor seeing hand closed force sensor grip well difference hard grip light grip devs need take force reading implement easier grip button nice upgrade ,1
bought month ago absolutely amazing improves every game support feel great hand make gameplay much natural especially picking throwing object added bonus free hla make purchase even better ,1

usually gonna default facing widest wall go advanced mode drawing square click advanced let rotate shrink play space within box outlined ,1
hilariously playing hour skyrim vr realized vr actually fixed huge problem game like skyrim namely broken loot economy skyrim looting every goddamn urn chest body sack shelf game would regularly end much gold could buy anything wanted real cost would run vendor sell thing would mod game give starting gold exchange vr though physically reaching loot everything exhausting action bad got real boring tedious would burn way calorie expected would enter room hundred urn groan ignore suddenly pick choose carry loot effect balanced game economy would consider armor buy vendor save get nice weapon upgrade also playing mage skyrim work much better vr get mage specific mod voice command mod whole new game enjoy ,1
tracking ring snap three time happened always repairable always pulled ribbon cable could pretty much snapped back together lost little bit plastic bit latch controller together one sensor seems fine ,1
dropped index controller waist height onto hard flooring stopped tracking wow sound really concerning always imagining knuckle would le prone breakage based obvious snap point tracking ring sound like maybe give htc prop build quality ,1
third episode bad buy ,1
yeah talking bit popping place full broken half plastic snapped htc refused repair ,1
able let go controller add ton immersion require game support though unless us grip button holding thing right ,1

neither internetz ,1
awesome thank doubt cpu would job looking possible upgrade vr kit wise ,1
ram fine used k matching mobo would budget within latest processor per core basis ,1
recently built computer x x f motherboard work fine ,1
still using fx great doubt handle wireless vive need ,1
yeah probably moved x using k wireless adapter would peg usage wireless adapter great cpu hungry ,1
actually really surprised well fx handle vr rift cv take wireless adapter reroute graphic back motherboard instead gpu ,1
vader immortal always touted episodic experience oculus called flagship title would line saying would really hurtful brand goal vr mean ,1
right top move ,1
well make cpu compress video stream fly essentially yes ,1
wear glove main issue tube rubber inside joystick degrades like butter idk differently steam controller fucking unusable however got question exactly rc car controller hurt like shit use spiked top stick mean ,1
mean whenever joystick pushed forward need click like button requires stretch thumb quite bit kinda requires make claw quickly cramp hand may short thumb personally get pretty uncomfortable pretty fast fortunately though game alternative run button least always rebind ,1
feel like simple question vive pro eye vive pro correct otherwise probably defect swap ,1
suck still probably get ,1
yeah would still recommend though personal gripe come often index controller definitely better og vive controller ,1
ok oculus bribe devs hardware lock store epic bribe devs hardware lock sure ,1
others half life alyx represent turning point waiting u another brick great road vr ,1
love like game think safe say killer apps part disrespect intended amazing devs feel like closest vr killer app point would something like beat saber superhot vr game people vr familiar certainly visible way someone buy switch untitled goose game think people would buy vr say duck season title like botw super mario odyssey becomes easier sell hardware game scale something like half life alyx oculus exclusive right smaller scale half life alyx definitely step right direction hopefully continue get killer game valve help push aaa publisher take vr seriously ,1
uhhh pretty sure besides bear saber half life alyx killer app ,1
one bad people know least upgrade get experienced ,1
people like spend time multiplayer game right far first killer app pavlov echo arena combat replaced desktop shooter rocket league still play buddy sometimes alone contest said plenty people never play multiplayer game want something sandbox hour story collection smaller experience half life alyx first mainstream franchised game appeal people also believe going seeing absolute avalanche new title major developer ambitious indie project announced next year two great time vr player ,1
contrarian much nah brah right water bear day ,1
ooooh true dumb fucking question ,1
woah dumb as question full force today ,1
think main issue people either never tried good vr tried minute le try game see one clicked given vr enough chance take effort slap half life new vr game interest peaked maybe give vr another shot like inception better movie star war inception draw big crowd name recognition ,1
try facebook marketplace seen one guy selling vive cad ,1
pretty neat ,1
know r vive though ,1
tried turning antivirus protection defender firewall might help ,1
mine grey screening video card c new video card went away ,1
lol figured game would catch flack tried recommend giving shot picked kiddos surprisingly enjoyed ,1
believe killer app see ,1
agreed always throw people quick easy game theblu superhot beat saber richie plank etc really wish easy put complex longer game either time constraint complex control prevent hopefully hl get adopter think people expected widespread adoption skyrim fallout regardless happens playing half life boneworks soon enough ,1
agree think people fence take plunge half life also good call addition hope newcomer look catalog game missed point simultaneously avoid trash cash grab ,1
yes buy cosmos shit htc top ,1
agreed plenty killer apps half life maybe killer apps bringing vr mainstream ,1
listing game make killer apps really stretching point lot mean water bear come ,1
yes fully example friend throw vive controller caught mid air throw virtual ball target lob thing easily estimate car braking distance estimate distance pretty well many ten meter like real life many game render stuff mono performance yes look much original vive best fitting glass rift bit smaller know cosmos index ,1
many game listed even controler support official vr version ,1
like honestly budget really need vr system see reasoning guess get youre talking really meant world pc vr go get oculus quest exactly target market device ,1
jump cobclusions try bait exclusivity never good epic much often affect lot people due lack hmds required headset like console exclusivity make sense still suck sure understandable ,1

console way play vr game without entry level hmds also similar price range ,1
ditto think well known franchise bring vr user casual rank maybe even turned google cardboard ,1
bought vive pre owned code came used eh think missed much ,1
really think youre missing point gone weird tangent regarding console oculus epic vr world except due additional hardware lock much worse epic ever unless also add hardware lock store case still get oculus bribe devs release store effectively block wmr htc valve user playing epic bribe devs release store creates minor inconvenience yet another store install worse able access game installing store playing immediately ,1
well le fine hopefully unless cpu bottleneck case id super disappointed ,1
think unless steam start bankrolling game way facebook probably two got competitive bid game devs make game probably see number really kick as game getting made would bolster market would give incentive make game bolster market give ,1

right whole point reply ,1
feel ya ,1
hlvr door talk colloquialism event presentation missed ,1
presentation month two ago google find simultaneously mundane interesting ,1
pancake user likely said way hl title would vr versus vr optional sooner later upgrade train pass leaving people behind yes think unplayable enjoyable wand index controller significantly different experience opinion way overpriced touch controller steamvr user paying unneeded experimental feature knuckle lite touch clone would job fine ,1
confirming subject would best place buy controller price trust wise ,1
meh tried knuckle week honestly game felt improved experience moss every game absolutely hated burning passion even gripping item much prefer vive grip button highly doubt anything feel like missing hl shall find soon ,1
valve sell index accessory use mail forwarding service use search function find aussie discussing topic good luck ,1

vive tear old release standalone knuckle package upgrade ought ok like complaining next gen console even need buy whole new console ,1
christmas come getting gift card hopefully ready eagle landed pre order uh oh maybe new pc hardware would great either poor santa need let pant drop christmas better hohoho ,1

interesting australian custom try charge gst bring back country ask melbourne australia also wanted buy note b bought intermediary end paying extra trouble ,1
really know people blindly upvote comment like without giving thought valve strategy making money centered around selling hardware never strategy likely ever invested first getting people pc gaming already second get people onto steam platform buy game math work cost lowering price hardware le value additional people platform reduce cost hardware steam also reason seen valve ip last decade luxury able wait really great idea pursue pursuing anything check keep coming due steam sale comment annoy much fact started kidding premise statement ridiculous ,1
year old actually time game released point though guarantee game playable perfectly well vive wand rift touch absolutely way require knuckle sort key gameplay function separate note played knuckle hated ,1
guy hilarious ,1
tone carry well internet comment kidding meant tongue cheek said index couple month one thing valve pride listening customer going piss lot people already spent money adopting index suddenly drop price economics also make sense thing people want charge people thing converse argument math work keep making money current price going drop price think see price drop index well least ,1
like technology would great deep sea exploration ,1
bangbangbangbangbang tvsmash fuck ,1
ok hopefully least get running ok vr long push game graphic setting steamvr super sampling high keep eye cpu gpu temp ok stick vr think come conclusion good gaming desktop far better good vr also make sure win date least preferably using problem thing check nvidia control panel setting make sure select prefer max performance power option also recommend selecting high performance power plan plugged wall power supply disable usb power saving like everything find good local pcvr help help good luck mate ,1

nearly bad epic bribing aaa company worse though least buy epic hardware access game ,1
frankly exactly problem index controller way expensive casual upgrade never enough home make viable game developer include anything cosmetic inconsequential feature controller course mean people le likely buy cost lot money spend get cosmetic feature personally think valve bit bullet released lighthouse index controller done nearly every vive owner would upgraded hell lot justifiable even oculus wmr user might bought bundle get knuckle lighthouse lighthouse knuckle never hit critical mass ,1

speaking experience k obviously beat saber aimple game fine already cpu intense game like fallout dirt k maxing thats looking actual owner feedback ,1
wireless vive pro run perfect ,1
vr break chicken egg problem foveated rendering k per eye headset right trade vr game get increased sense immersion exchange inferior visuals foveated rendering trade disappears playing game vr becomes better term immersion term display fidelity reach point make sense simply port rd person action game vr people use controller play like would normally point chicken egg problem solved vr port using controller expensive make sufficiently advanced vr headset could quite compelling unfortunately mean motion control vr game market know largely left behind necessary take vr mainstream ,1
k literally fastest gaming cpu existence handle wireless almost one could use anyway far need wa regular vive anything core thread good enough may able get away completely ideal vive pro need core smt also plus necessarily required recommend something like ryzen x x k k k second gen ryzen x x also run personal experience probably would also fine buying new may well get one previously listed cpu ,1
go vega vr vega fury older amd gpus perform worse vr apparently fixed navi xt used always get better deal try buy reputable seller preferably card still warranty left ,1
vr honestly almost always gpu limited even older cpu except rare game push lot pixel maintain vr resolution fps ,1

yeah sadly really buck strap sadly vive feel alright finally found point turning knob make feel right still feel kinda weird ,1
interested know knob talking real og vive velcro elastic perhaps seen updated model elastic maybe think modifying welding mask headgear made purpose similar backing wmr psvr headset knob contract expands recommended diy project north star headset amazon http www amazon com k welding mask headgear ref nb sb no low bet could also get one used trashed ,1

ebay flat gamer save rtx card ray tracing going huge console incorporate super new though went literally used s almost every game buying pimax k set card go route ,1
worth noting openxr oculus libovr support layered rendering idea element screen drawn normal resolution thing like ui element rendered much higher strong anti aliasing depending eg rectangle hmd driver play special trick make look sharper imo effective angular resolution nd generation headset quest index rift vive pro fine game world though obviously higher would better text ui element could really resolution bump interestingly approach tends used quite heavily quest giving sharp uis rendering world quite low resolution ,1
looking forward first two mention ,1
bruh never said raytracing capability good ,1

upgraded k old k reason wireless run like dream fine ,1
hmm ,1
pretty cool way get low cost solution resistive feedback still think thing pull back finger way go le limitation space wise bulky costly small scale operation feedback would work great way fill air water mixture could make also simulate weight object would make bulky would hard drain ballon without changing shape drastically also would deal inertia water filled balloon move hand around quickly overall well designed design worked extensively make entire thing sits hand like glove ,1
mention pimax ,1
although interesting concept sure could ever see practical counting logistics keeping managing compressed air conveniently near person would something like handle even light stress inflate deflate quickly hand open close happens pop ,1
ok k issue cpu good np make sure new mobo x solt right cpu ,1

motion control still exist optional add headset real mass seller playing port using controller motion controller needed right playing game could otherwise play tv vr headset simply compelling vr mode need lower graphic setting simply look worse viewed tv foveated rendering graphic compromise need made k look close sharp add tv price another advantage approach motion control optional headset able made around fall nicely normal consumer expected price add product porting non motion controlls game use motion control hard many good port porting use controller vr headset really hard vr survive without going route expect kind growth last year lot company lost lot money vr market investor expected larger market getting spooked aaa game require lot money make make sense expect long time indie game slow growth larger game made loss foreseeable future ,1
would need vive tracker usb dongle order controller communicate computer steam controller dongle flashed thing ,1
http www youtube com watch v sim gfg lp feature youtu ,1

creative idea inherently limited wonder bothered opposing object thumb case work immutable technique push anything ,1
also vary actual perception material inflation amount although size probably directly related inflation amount little leeway ,1
bought weekend bundle includes base game season dlc pinball game compare anything else certainly enjoying real complaint occasional missed trigger press always seems occur worst possible moment costing ball looked table yet one lot going ,1
sound like thermal issue crash long period time bsod window computer usually hardware driver arguably hardware issue try updating driver nvidia website possible otherwise get latest driver asus website model official nvidia driver work try asus driver asus driver work try nvidia driver x b also general rule thumb making sure laptop well ventilated ,1
removing controller obviously lead mass adoption removing much better headset controller port aaa game oculus fundamentally right controller right choice mass adoption problem headset tech good enough justify annoyance cost vr yet yes headset tech probably ish year still vr market still small dominated indie devs coming one indie dev currently working vr title motion control motion controller game always place mass adoption happen time soon motion control required make vr compelling ,1
far severe experienced much closer saw http imgur com wnis jz exvsk r http imgur com wnis jz exvsk r ,1
might able second membrane could pulled tightly could limit space internal balloon could make smaller object feel harder inflating higher pressure smaller space ,1
yeah sound like could work ,1
also posted r virtualreality writing response ,1
r hlvr wait ,1
know let tards like near electronic device ,1
fundamentally right using game controller instead motion controller rift quest come motion controller also easy port title people use game controller happening sorry think augment hold weight yes need aaa content content case must take advantage motion control ,1
thanks curated camera control work game fact look bad motion sickness matter slowly getting body used develop resistance likely doable vocal minority seems adamant ,1
alright sound le expensive thanks ,1
tried wow ever stuttery ,1
super duper clear need one dongle per controller guide well aligning steamvr playspace wmr one since even though chaperone boundary steamvr show properly coordinate tracking controller first ,1
probably actually know way may proven right rumor started heard happen true either way kind funny ,1
possible use veryjos get head tracking use grandtheftvr com handle gun movement ok use first one let shoot vehicle odd separate author working independent mod surely working together way go ,1
problem started wearing high face ,1
first see clearly away irl need wear glass hmd think might overestimating level vision u ,1
maybe driver issue contacted htc support error code step taken far ,1
im overestimating anything assuming anything asking focal distance hmd remember right vive like ,1
thanks sadly none ,1
work unfortunately guessing bluetooth dongle got kinda screwed due whatever caused random reboot might try flash something wait reinstall window see anything thanks tho ,1
simply turn mirroring see everything screen game display screen default ,1
thanks ended change floor layout face monitor honestly le effort getting walking across room put headset every second lol ,1
always thought solution would come essentially full body suit cable run throughout cable would tighten loose based trying running water cable built leg give resistance trying pick heavy object cable arm back make impossible grabbing rock cable get tense exact dimension rock feel like grabbed onto think would work well simulating resistance real world ,1
keep floor space facing away make sure hmd facing monitor starting steam vr problem yet try see help using lot modding skyrim fo checking fps different texture mod much easier ,1
answer probably answer yet answer nope anwer literaly opened setup boom crash error close ,1
man would awesome max vollmer could get hl vr public beta would amazing stream maybe also waiting hl anniversary get lucky ,1
sound amazing hope one day get point one thing help picture would light tension tightened hard could seriously hurt wearer ,1
thanks yeah ended getting testing sony one sits little tilted forward issue ,1
actually bluetooth steamvr lag need one per tracked device ,1

http haptx com exists ,1
really liked demonstration button style interaction ar turning flat surface malleable one cool stuff ,1
yeah unfortunately general issue oculus friend matchmaking right discussed revive discord gist oculus headset connected oculus service send needed heartbeat eventually service consider disconnected remove game idea possible workarounds explored right without oculus hardware work ,1
see thanks information ,1
bought gearvr amazon adapter printed using dhubs com ,1
definitely wear go level everyone seems inevitable exist point cool ,1
glad work well distortion fix needed valid claim make best test lens ensure win gearvr lens lottery minimize issue distortion fix basically lie universal distortion fix either calibration process unique every headset lens combo applying setting another user enough might good enough average person still far distortion free worse stock lens ,1

like said modern vr headset provide compelling experience without addition motion control currently change motion controllerless vr make lot sense average gamer saying foveated rendering fundamentally change game make sense play aaa controller port vr headset looked worse k tv get high re foveated rendering vr objectively becomes best way play normal game could wrong high re foveated rendering headset could end still le compelling tv monitor game case though expect mainstreaming vr least another year would require hundred million game development investment loss get past chicken egg problem see environment investor already pressuring company like facebook lackluster vr growth likely future motion controller based vr ecosystem slow consistent growth indie game slowdown investment fine buy expect aaa vr content time soon ,1
hand play vr game max setting least couple year gtx rift boo asking vive subreddit im budget ,1

still buy country next two month maybe planning worldwide release maybe announcement release date hl like june ,1
yes title free headset really going entice people ,1
topic warned htc literally incapable honoring warranty right apparently need new warehouse method giving product stocked sale even find one find deal newer model buy comfortable warranty unsaid amount time ,1
yep make comment like fully aware lot believe true care people believe real though ,1

summary dont want watch video big year vr video go detail think looked back landmark year virtual reality video split part hardware software hardware go little detail past think vr didnt take much industry insider expected talk new headset launch year oculus launched rift quest may valve launched index june htc launched something called cosmos one give shit new headset cater different audience give option quest affordable option people without p gaming pc rift priced well easy setup inside tracking index deeper pocket want le compromise also still psvr cheapest affordable p already dropping regular basis never easier someone get vr gaming quest selling well overall turned corner term accessability ease use significant step forward visual clarity comfort software back beginning consumer vr game basic lot short indie wave shooter thing felt like tech demo rather fully fleshed vr game want developer playing safe lot game using teleportation movement especially exclusive stuff oculus sony big aaa game take along time develop large team people working full time cost alot money year consumer vr starting see big game dreamt like asgard wrath blood truth stormland iron man vr medal honor lone echo horizon exclusive also seeing smaller indie developer really start get grip vr game development earlier studio bringing next level game term scope world interaction game like boneworks walking dead saint sinner espire etc lot game work know alot announced next year overall think massive year vr gaming big step forward hardware software also p confirmed next year support current psvr plus load excellent game feel like generation forward people agree talking poo pipe ,1
get gtx ti comparable gtx except newer price range contain various new feature vr non vr title due tuning architecture ray tracing k version without overclockable board gtx still play get plenty frame drop le stellar performance cpu also need upgrade ,1
world live country decent consumer right law able get unit fixed replaced without much hassle hmd little year old unusable tracking issue got replaced perfect ever since ,1
http www reddit com r valveindex comment dx ohb possible gta v vr revive fix ,1
hard say tracking issue kinda unusual assuming done normal stuff try deal get rid notable reflective surface around etc certainly option dont know use case get frustration hate shit work properly warning index lot potential frustration road think lack common compatibility whatever vr game app want play would probably biggest issue plus depending causing tracking issue given still us lighthouse tracking chance issue remain seems like big risk given much cost ,1
could probably tested unplug one lighthouse one still active play something let stay mostly forward facing towards lighthouse try one see notable issue either ,1
happens several game observer example technohorror blade runner inspired game starring rutger hauer would boot straight vive vr albeit terrifyingly janky floating character headless body ,1
despite new hardware sold headset year waiting substantial progress early vr enthusiast im looking forward compact micro oled headset immersive high quality aaa experience think social vr done right lot potential gone nowhere really amounting much feel even everyone given future advanced high quality headset today simply quality game experience really make nothing depth longevity people return daily least ,1
yeah bad ,1
tracked controller finnally added mod ,1
link channel ,1
sorry brother none happened mine could rant index though ,1
veryjos downsider romeo video either way think issue violently real vr want continue working best gta v mod still though ,1
technical standpoint yes appealing algorithm tho something would call good artistry watch video end go yes dude likeable yes speaks manner make understandable yes video well edited yes he best entertaining yes he bad playing game yes made minute video called guide ,1
would really good vr game valve give check hint hint interesting game ,1
headset used take forever start tracking like upwards ten minute sometimes lot problem greyouts playing thought bad lighthouse well turned one sensor headset bad disconnected one lighthouse trying track headset would connect quickly track perfectly long facing away active lighthouse sensor left eye screwy covered electrical tape since rock solid includes using tpcast wireless maybe worth experimenting tracking one frustrating thing ever dealt computer wise around good luck hope solve ,1
odd game positive review steam lot people saying expected bad surprisingly really good ,1
look awesome ,1

mirroring option one seem impact performance using game application rendering window using steam vr display mirroring using option may impact performance notice stuttering course depends game nothing rendering game hi re screen time option use steam vr display mirror option steam vr run full screen nothing direct mirror displayed vr briefly speaking work way playing movie playing game rendering happens least much case option personally use option vr party recording vr streaming personally better display controller additional screen ovrdrop ,1
well let get thing complicated try help let see work since steam vr update via steam maybe setting got corrupted sometimes need reinstall steam vr especially want reinstall vr runtime disable steam theater setting enabled often make game crash disable steam beta participation enabled sometimes may cause issue especially steam update another thing direct x assume problem related vr game work monitor would worth reinstall direct x also may help share error log steam log see log steamvr good luck shout loud need help ,1
custom song game bought refunded almost immediately saw ten song know devs would release official title ,1
feel like something going facebook meet eye mean recently jre enthusiastic vr promise general tell conversation way thinking quitting back two month later suddenly disappointed pace vr development leaf work hobby agi project never really expressed interest maybe much tinfoil really feel like shenanigan behind scene said screw ,1
restart steamvr see update go away ,1
also hinted jre interview enjoyed coding care much managerial aspect talked excitedly following new technology trend well maybe reevaluated life decided get back part life enjoyed go back coding position could reading wrong way perspective ,1
look forward carmack making something utilised game guy revolutionised gaming wasted oculus ,1
expressed interest agi though discount possibility something going expressed mild concern way thing handled connect talk ,1
ok exactly asked left cv get vive pro bought vive used sensor controller bought vive pro hmd originally set index hmd stock got used vive pro cheaper used anyway tracking huge improvement cv also ordered gear mod put og vive waited vive pro sure screen door looked way better cv recieved vive pro great way better gear mod even plan getting index hmd point keep seeing issue rift people get replacement issue still exist repeat repeat rift great work tacking well good still playable good got vive pro setup plus gear mod close cosmos cost vive setup came da original setup great deal plus backup headset vive pro break gear mod really happy original vive honestly think better route return shit ,1
believe physic actually easier part vrppp starting good place eleven update refinement complete mess game launched ,1
vive discontinued obsolete way anyway waste money unless get really cheap ,1
yeah allowed spend time coding despite managerial position worked directly gearvr quest codebases unless changed seems like weird quick turnaround anyway speculation course ,1
yeah noticed looked awhile sure new normal ,1
anything wasted stuff pulled mobile vr quite feat imagine saw solved hard challenge point want move rest challenge bucket list ,1
maybe weak quest sale main driver behind quest knockout success facebook probably interested ,1
blame anyone wanting distance facebook ,1
upgraded recently notice much difference ,1
buying vive vive discontinued recommend buying something nearly year old ,1
steal time lol ,1
original htc battery good cosmos imagine anker powerbanks everyone recommends also go damn ,1
would good index much pricier ,1
depends multiple factor like pc spec ipd use case budget etc however generally speaking popular option index rift quest wmr headset give detail give specific recommendation ,1
spec gb ipd slightly smaller normal adult use case non commercial budget really limit ignore ,1
maybe mod replace song game another long bpm close work pretty close ,1
get best index use case meant line intend play use recommendation different flight driving simulator example want good pc based anything setup decision realistically index rift however quest also worth considering get link cable soon allow used also pc headset portability something woul value quest really competition yet wmr side odyssey ridiculously good value find sale however controller controller tracking volume compete setup listed ,1
mean msi afterburner solves lot problem slightly inclined index valve well people finally see flipping without game censoring swears think would play rec room beat saber holoception maybe experiment unity ,1
afterburner wont solve problem running heavier title good setting index hz refresh leave overclocked ti cry mercy hz fine note get like experience rift third price want pay premium index better ,1
started vr cardboard anything fps feel awesome switch headset notice like screen door effect though people stop seeing immersed unsee definite trade bringing laptop extra difficult decision though amount flexibility get fun get price compelling even mobile super omputer think said work laptop leave damn thing home go vacation get suite invite local hotties play beatsaber ,1
know afterburner help much well personal preference pay extra finger tracking ,1
heart mind ,1
mean perfecting middle line hardware wasted ,1
never done know something adhesive use cyanoacetylate common variety super glue would bad aware replacement sold would look using something like adhesive velcro strip similar obviously would need one half could cut trim suit ,1
make sense robot covet organic asset ,1
get old lol ,1
yes sure bad pc right barely heard right ,1
foundation others build everything need add make vr system obvious capable hand planted seed become mainstream vr ,1

hey thanks sharing familiar valve htc relationship oddly though watching video month ago regarding rift tracking similar issue gate well think problem resolved eventually tbh another poster mentioned using ir camera four sensor low light even issue right calibration interesting see headset develops next couple month see potential sure ,1
maybe pace vr mean might want work something feel impact getting back term pace vr recent passion shifted many field year might time work something else hopefully sign oculus facebook issue although surprised ,1
bet happy oculus focusing quest inherently powered compared pc vr quest neat cable free form factor carmack always wanting push limit much quest term experience ,1

ouch thinking moving asus board maybe universal issue recently moved home play room zero reflection still issue time time loss really ,1
perhaps realized short time mortal decided build ai live place complete side project ,1
cool ,1
imagine could new base station reasonably large space would still need laptop strapped back think wireless would work two people big space would also need custom software allows two people sync universe essentially share universe never tried anything like though take say grain salt ,1
guy wizard ,1
yes backpack pc custom build game ,1
yes also expressed frustration lower power mobile processor quest nut cracked simply optimizing thing left software game developer oculus team recent disappointment pace development might compounded powered quest oculus primary focus ,1

psvr much larger install base half cost quest might quest downplay quest ,1
think point half dome carrot og supporter see facebook selling enthusiast headset carmack hand pragmatic think interest working something stay fb ip drawer benefit user ,1
facebook stated goal billion people using vr current pace quest take year get see expectation reality little disconnect thing speed lot vr became relevant mainstream every current vr enthusiast dead another thing facebook also announced user spent million oculus content well let look another little kickstarter project time star citizen made million matter twist vr runaway success everybody hoped even close best good enough die gain tiny niche compared every entertainment medium around ,1

quick google search looked review seems bad quality last long ,1
oculus rift valve index fuck vive ,1
assume index price range tried psvr know like vr would suggest afford went vive relatively cheap entry point try vr ensure like enough ensuring could upgrade better steamvr based headset future without buy new sensor controller care upgrade path rift bad idea going oculus though would wait see quest link turn good might better getting quest rift ,1
vive year still love need da prefer using good quality earbuds instead people like comfort add tpcast wireless couple year ago could never go back wired huge improvement also pimax play much rather smaller fov able wireless large play area though small area might matter much sister psvr vive definitely better ,1
old post mine http old reddit com r vive comment v nu base station blinking red light ebydwhf st k xkkzur sh ff telling physically check ,1
used vive almost six month oculus cv user year con comfort wise dont buy da pretty lame control day night worse oculus buy pair index controller add total cost already elevated set lighthouse cannot use vive place unless setup place wich tedious compared te rift wich external sensor screendor effect due wider fov think sweet spot worse thank oculus cv rift better pro tracking excelent tryed rift compare fov wider plus immersion thing noticed first bought oculus cv x b think og vive great first vr device drawback day device market dont think good purchase ,1
really never tried psvr based spec look like vive give better image guess psvr might better lens ,1
thanks would consider index since going wireless simply find go back cable ,1
able get trend net going total length going work fine read battle though course hitting another issue cpu usage old xeon processor keep compression game like skyrim work fine beat saber others set compositor process real time skyrim assume others blocky upgrading skyrim bit much kid mostly play game work might live upgrade computer opportunistically ,1

put overpopulated list ,1
know stated practical experience headset seems simplified telling psvr day comfort visuals choice vive notice sde way og vive color pixel separated vive far least favorite headset look obviously best track something like mixed reality capture tiltbrush recording original elastic strap make unnecessarily front heavy deluxe audio strap greatly improved much weight v psvr personally big noggin sitting watch movie live youtube broadcast sit couch psvr mention quest quest favorite headset delxue audio strap fused wireless freedom missing psvr halfway expect reply spec see seem outweigh practical experience nevertheless think ,1
yeah like first game vastly improved physic fan first game fan table tennis game general like play table tennis game even flat one feel different fun factor come immersion realism physic main thing need physic fun game depth ,1
pc vr set right assure satisfied vive choose purchase definitely research vr headset best though also highly recommend adding hotdog horseshoe handgrenades h vr list game single player find infinitely fun pavlov zero caliber really play blade sorcery pavlov fun good game especially playing ttt zero caliber seem great played demo ,1
